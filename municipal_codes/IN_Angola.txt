(b) The debtor cannot be located, nor any of the debtor’s assets.

(c) The debtor has no assets and there is no expectation they will have any in the future.

However, this guideline will not apply if the debt is fully discharged in bankruptcy or if the account was disputed and the office has insufficient documentation to pursue collections. [Ord. 1458-2013. Code 2000 § 33.007.]


3.05.080 Fund balance financial policy.

(A) This policy shall be known as the fund balance financial policy of the city (“policy”).

(B) This policy will be used to frame major policy initiatives, and those initiatives shall be summarized in the annual budgets for the city governmental funds, Waterworks Utility and Wastewater Utility. Initiatives may include staffing levels and compensation, maintenance programs, capital improvements, and debt management. During the annual budget process, the policy will be reviewed to ensure initiatives are followed within the limits of a structurally balanced budget that is financially sustainable within the context of long-term forecasting.

(C) This policy will be used to define the appropriate level of unrestricted fund balance target levels in governmental operating, special revenue, debt service, and capital funds and in enterprise operating and maintenance, sinking, and improvement funds.

(1) A variety of factors shall be considered, including:

(a) The predictability of revenues and the volatility of expenditures;

(b) The perceived exposure to significant one-time outlays (for example, disasters, immediate capital needs, budget cuts);

(c) The potential drain upon general fund resources from other funds as well as the availability of resources in other funds (that is, deficits in other funds may require that a higher level of unrestricted fund balance be maintained in the general fund just as the availability of resources in other funds may reduce the amount of unrestricted fund balance needed in the general fund);

(d) Liquidity (that is, a disparity between when financial resources actually become available to make payments and the average maturity of related liability may require that a higher level of resources be maintained); and

(e) Commitments and assignments (that is, the city may wish to maintain higher levels of unrestricted fund balance to compensate for any portion of unrestricted fund balance already committed or assigned by the city for a specific purpose).

(2) Unrestricted Fund Balance Target Levels.

(a) Governmental Funds.

(i) Operating Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for operating funds shall be no less than two months and not more than six months of budgeted expenditures.

(ii) Special Revenue Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for special revenue funds shall be no less than two months and not more than six months of budgeted expenditures.

(iii) Debt Service Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for debt service funds shall be no less than the next debt service payment and not more than the total debt service due in the fiscal year for which the minimum is established.

(iv) Capital Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for capital funds with a dedicated revenue source shall be no less than six months of budgeted expenditures. For those funds without a dedicated revenue source, the minimum unrestricted fund balance target level shall be equal to the forecasted capital improvements.

(b) Enterprise Funds.

(i) Operating and Maintenance Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for operating and maintenance funds shall be no less than two months of operation and maintenance expense.

(ii) Sinking Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for the sinking fund bond and interest account requires an amount equal to one sixth of the next interest payment and one sixth of the next principal payment to be deposited in the account. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for the sinking fund debt service reserve account requires an amount equal to the maximum combined annual debt service.

(iii) Improvement Funds. The minimum unrestricted fund balance target level for improvement funds shall be equal to the forecasted capital improvements for the ensuing year.

(D) This policy will be used to replenish unrestricted fund balances below target levels as soon as budgetary and economic conditions allow and preferably within one to three years of use.

(1) In the event unrestricted fund balances are below minimum target levels set by this policy, this policy will be used to determine which resources will be directed to replenish those funds.

(a) For governmental funds, those resources may include:

(i) New revenue streams;

(ii) Changes to existing revenue streams;

(iii) Nonrecurring revenues;

(iv) Budget surpluses;

(v) Excess resources in other funds, if legally permissible;

(vi) Year-end resources; and

(vii) Moneys accumulated in the rainy day fund.

(b) For enterprise funds, those resources may include moneys in the improvement funds.

(2) If all resources have been directed to replenish those funds, the following strategies shall be considered for governmental and enterprise funds:

(a) Reevaluate goals that guide budget decision making and the approaches to achieve those goals by reassessing needs, priorities, challenges, and opportunities, such as:

(i) What services are top priorities, such as public safety, culture and recreation, highways, and economic development;

(ii) What has to be accomplished, including staffing levels and compensation, maintenance programs, capital improvements, and debt management;

(iii) What is the appropriate level of property taxes to apply toward such services as trash collection, hydrant rental, public safety, highways, and culture and recreation;

(iv) What services should be cost based;

(v) What level of cost sharing with other governments, private entities, and institutions is appropriate for such items as municipal utilities;

(vi) What are unrestricted fund balance targets for operating funds, special revenue funds, debt service funds, and capital funds.

(3) For enterprise funds, in addition to subsection (D)(2) of this section, the city, with the assistance of a financial advisor, will annually review current rates and charges and nonrecurring charges to determine if adequate to meet initiatives.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

Capital Assets. Tangible assets of a durable nature employed in the operating activities of the city and relatively permanent and needed for the production or sale of goods or services are termed “property,” “plant and equipment” and “capital assets.” This broad group is usually separated into classes according to the physical characteristics of the items.

“Capital outlays” means expenditures which benefit both the current and future fiscal periods. This includes costs of acquiring land or structures; construction or improvement of buildings, structures or other capital assets; and equipment purchases having an appreciable and calculable period of usefulness. These are expenditures resulting in the acquisition of or addition to the city’s capital assets.

“Enterprise funds” means those funds used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise, where the intent of the city is that the expenses, including depreciation of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or, where the city has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other purposes. The enterprise funds of the city include the municipally owned water and wastewater utilities and any other utility that may be established by the Common Council. Operation of these utilities shall require enterprise fund accounting and reporting.

“Historical cost” means the cash equivalent price exchanged for goods or services at the date of acquisition. Land, buildings and equipment are common examples of items recognized under the historical cost attribute.

“Inventory” means tangible assets of a lesser value than capital assets as defined in the provisions of this section.

“Tangible assets” means assets that can be observed by one or more of the physical senses that may be seen and touched and, in some environments, heard and smelled. [Ord. 1135-2004; Ord. 944-97, 1997. Code 2000 § 33.030.]

[Res. 2001-327. Code 2000 § 33.082.]


3.25.040 Objectives and permissible investment instruments.

The primary objectives, in priority order, of city investment activities shall be:

(A) Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital. To obtain this objective, diversification to the extent that such is consistent with Indiana investment and deposit law is required. As stated in IC 5-13-9 et seq., investments are limited to the following instruments:

(1) Securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury which includes direct obligations of the United States and obligations of a federal agency, a federal instrumentality, or a governmental enterprise that are fully guaranteed by the United States.

(2) Investment accounts offered by a designated public depository.

(3) Repurchase or resale agreements with depositories designated by the Indiana State Board of Finance, provided such monies are fully collateralized.

(4) Obligations issued, assumed, or guaranteed by the International Bank for Reconstruction or the AD Bank.

(5) Investments commonly known as money market mutual funds that are in the form of securities of or interests in an open-end, no-load, management-type investment company or investment trust registered under the provisions of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. Section 80a et seq.). In addition, this investment must be authorized by action of the Common Council and undertaken pursuant to the provisions of IC 5-13-9-2.5. The form of securities of or interests in an investment company or investment trust herein described must be rated as one of the following:

(a) AAAm, or its equivalent, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation or its successor.

(b) Aaa, or its equivalent, by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or its successor.

(B) Liquidity. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that enables it to remain sufficiently liquid in order to meet all operating disbursing requirements and/or capital projects disbursing requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. To obtain this objective, cash flow estimates and project expensing timetables will be developed to the extent that such is consistent with Indiana investment and depository law. In addition, the following guidelines will be observed:

(1) Investments for funds deemed available for periods of 74 days or less, the investing officer will as much as possible utilize pursuant to IC 36-1-7 et seq., or other investment instrument that permits the greatest liquidity and fund movement without corresponding loss of return or penalty;

(2) Investments for funds deemed available for periods of over 74 days, the investing officer will as much as possible utilize time instruments such as certificates of deposit or similar instruments that provide a greater yield and preserve safety for funds for which liquidity is less critical;

(3) In order to balance the objectives of liquidity and minimize idleness of fund balances, all operating cash should be maintained as much as possible in interest bearing draft, checking, or negotiable orders of withdrawal accounts.

(C) Return on Investment. The investment portfolio of the city shall be designed or undertaken with the objective of attaining a rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the city’s investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. [Res. 2001-327. Code 2000 § 33.083.]


3.25.050 Performance standards.

(A) The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of obtaining a rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with cash flow needs and with the investment risk constraints established by IC 5-13-9 et seq.

(B) Market Yield (Benchmark). The city’s investment strategy is to combine a combination of passive and active strategies as follows:

(1) The passive strategy is to utilize, as much as possible, interest bearing checking accounts for the operational cash flow needs.

(2) In addition, the city will employ as much as possible a three-pronged active investment methodology, some of which is set forth in AMC 3.25.040(A)(2).

(a) The city will employ certificates of deposit for those proceeds where liquidity in under 74 days is not an issue.

(b) The city will employ repurchase agreements or sweep accounts in order to provide coverage for funds usually idle and not placed either in the local government investment pool (LGIP), certificate of deposit, or other permissible instruments.

(c) The city will employ the LGIP in order to increase yield on funds for which liquidity demands are such as to make suitable the use of either the sweep account or the certificate of deposit and still comply with this policy.

(C) Based upon the strategy outlined in this section, the basis used by the Clerk-Treasurer to determine whether yields are being achieved shall be the 90-day Treasury bill (T-bill) rate. [Res. 2001-327. Code 2000 § 33.084.]


3.25.060 Ethics and conflicts of interest.

Officials and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Officials and employees shall disclose to the Mayor and to the Clerk-Treasurer in writing any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within their jurisdiction, and they shall further disclose any large personal financial investment positions that could be related to the performance of the city. [Res. 2001-327. Code 2000 § 33.085.]


3.25.070 Reporting and policy review.

(A) The Clerk-Treasurer shall provide at least annually a written report, to be available to the public and to the Common Council, providing relevant information regarding the investment activities of the city for the immediately preceding fiscal year just ended.

(B) The Clerk-Treasurer shall review the investment policy at least annually and make such changes as may be required by state law, by action of the Common Council, or as may be desirable to optimize the investing function for the public interest. [Res. 2001-327. Code 2000 § 33.086.]


3.25.080 Depositories designated.

The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized to deposit, invest, and reinvest monies as determined and identified by the Clerk-Treasurer in any financial institution identified eligible by the Indiana Board of Depositories and located within the city corporate limits.

It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city.

Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

(1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, and sexual assault and exploitation.

(2) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.

(3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city’s rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city’s interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

(4) The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects. [Ord. 1418-2012. Code 2000 § 112.01.]

12.10.040 Street construction materials and specifications – Geotechnical engineering services and report.

Geotechnical engineering services shall be performed under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer registered in the state of Indiana. These services include a subsurface investigation, pavement design and preparation of a written report and shall be provided by the developer of the project. At least one copy of the report must be submitted to the city of Angola for review.

(K) An evaluation of the effect of weather and/or construction on the pavement subgrade during construction. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 1. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.050 Street construction materials and specifications – Field investigation.

The field investigation needs to be designed to evaluate subgrade soil types, determine groundwater levels, and examine support conditions along the proposed alignment. It should be noted that, before any field exploration, the locating and marking of utilities within and around the project area shall be performed at least 48 hours prior to the boring program. Buried utilities must be located prior to any excavation or drilling. It is the responsibility of the geotechnical consultant to contact Holey-Moley to locate and mark all known utilities in the area of the borings. Traffic control during the subsurface investigation is also the responsibility of the geotechnical consultant. The sections below summarize the minimum requirements for the field investigation.

(A) Boring Methods.

(1) Borings should be advanced using three-and-one-quarter-inch I.D. (inside diameter) hollow-stem augers. Samples should be recovered in the undisturbed material below the bottom of the augers using the standard drive sample technique in accordance with AASHTO T-206. A two-inch O.D. (outside diameter) by one-and-three-eighths-inch I.D. split-spoon sampler is driven a total of 18 inches with the number of blows of a 140-pound hammer falling 30 inches recorded for each six inches of penetration. The sum of blows for the final 12 inches of penetration is the standard penetration test result commonly referred to as the N-value (or blow-count). Split-spoon samples should generally be recovered at two-and-one-half-foot intervals to a depth of 10 feet, and at five-foot intervals thereafter to the termination of the boring.

(2) Boring depths are to be a minimum of seven and one-half feet below the design subgrade in cut areas. In fill areas, borings shall be drilled to a depth of seven and one-half feet or one and one-half times the fill height (whichever is greater). Boring depths may need to be extended if poor soils are encountered during the investigation.

(3) In general, boring locations should be dictated by topography, proposed maximum cut/fill locations, utilities, and visible surface conditions. However, for planning purposes, borings should be drilled at a maximum spacing of 300 feet and in alternating lanes. Additional borings along the alignment should be drilled to investigate conditions such as filled drainage ways, obvious poor subgrade areas, etc., as determined by the professional engineer.

(4) Groundwater levels must be measured and recorded during boring drilling and after the competition of the drilling process.

(B) Boring Backfill. Upon completion of the boring program, borings drilled in nonstructural (topsoil) areas should be backfilled with auger cuttings. However, if borings are drilled in existing roadway areas, they must be backfilled with auger cuttings up to a minimum depth of five feet below the existing surface and then should be backfilled to one foot below the existing ground surface with bentonite or a material of similar properties. The remaining foot should be backfilled with pavement patch material (asphalt patch for asphalt pavements and quickset concrete for concrete pavements). [Ord. 1473-2014 § 2. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.060 Street construction materials and specifications – Laboratory testing.

Samples obtained from the soil borings should be taken to a soils laboratory where they shall be classified and have the required soil testing performed. The main purpose behind laboratory testing is to classify and group subgrade material to evaluate support properties and moisture conditions that can affect the long-term pavement performance. Laboratory testing may consist of the following: grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, moisture content, unconfined compression, California bearing ratio, swell/consolidation tests, loss of ignition test, and other tests as deemed necessary.

(A) Soil Classification. All samples obtained from the soil borings should be classified according to the AASHTO classification system. All samples shall be visually classified, but classification testing shall be performed on a representative sample from each major soil type. These tests include the Atterberg limits and sieve and/or hydrometer analyses.

(B) Moisture Content. The natural moisture content shall be performed for every cohesive soil sample obtained from the borings. This information is used to evaluate the moisture profile at each boring location. Soil modification shall be considered as a viable option when the in situ moisture content in the upper one to two feet of the pavement subgrade is more than four percent higher than optimum moisture content. See AMC 12.10.100 for soil modification requirements.

(C) Proctor Compaction Tests. Moisture-density (Proctor) curve should be obtained for soils in cut areas that will be used as fill for the project. A Proctor curve may also be needed for soils at the proposed subgrade depth if the soil varies from the cut sections. The modified Proctor compaction test should be performed according to AASHTO T-180.

(D) Resilient Modulus or California Bearing Ratio. The pavement design will be based on the soil’s resilient modulus (Mr) determined directly from a resilient modulus test or correlated from the California bearing ratio (CBR) test using:

	Mr (psi) = 1500 × CBR

(1) Most of the soils within the city of Angola consist of clay soil materials (72 percent), while sands and gravel consist of about 14 percent. Typical CBR values for these soil types are summarized in the table below.

Typical CBR Values 

	Soil Type	CBR (%)

	Natural Clay	3 to 5

	Compacted Clay	5 to 7

	Natural Sand or Gravel	7 to 15

	Compacted Sand or Gravel	10 to 30

(2) CBR and resilient modulus testing should be performed in accordance with AASHTO T-93 and T-307, respectively. For most projects, one test should be sufficient. The sample to be tested shall be determined by the geotechnical consultant based on the predominance of the soil type along the alignment and sound engineering judgment. If the CBR is less than two, or resilient modulus is less than 3,000 psi, soil stabilization shall be used as described in AMC 12.10.100.

(E) Other Tests. Additional testing may be needed depending on the soils obtained from the field investigation. Loss on ignition (organic content) tests shall be performed in accordance with AASHTO T-267 if samples contain soils identified as peats and/or other organic material with similar organic properties or in an area of known peat pockets in subgrade soils. Other tests, including consolidation, unconfined compression, etc., may be performed if soft clay soils are encountered. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 3. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.070 Street construction materials and specifications – Pavement design standards.

(A) General. The pavements, which are to be constructed within public rights-of-way, shall be designed to conform to the following standards. The design method shall be based on the 1993 AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures. Alternatively, the newer Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide may be used. The pavement design shall incorporate the results of the subsurface investigation, laboratory testing and anticipated traffic. The pavement section shall be designed by an experienced and qualified engineer licensed in the state of Indiana. The sections below provide guidance for both flexible (asphalt) and rigid (concrete) pavements.

(B) Asphalt Pavements. Asphalt pavements shall consist of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Note that there are many different pavement sections that will adequately support the anticipated traffic for the given subsurface conditions. Therefore, the designer has some flexibility in determining the recommended pavement section components based on cost, availability of materials, local practice, etc. Thus, there is no standard pavement section recommended in this chapter, but the following minimum pavement sections for both residential and industrial/commercial streets are shown in the table below. Underdrains shall be used if the long-term water level is within two feet of the bottom of the pavement section. Underdrains shall meet the requirements of INDOT Standard Specification 718 and be installed on both sides of the proposed roadway or street.

	Street Classification	Minimum Asphalt Pavement Section

	Residential Mixture Type B	1.5 inch – Asphalt Surface – 9.5 mm

3 inches – Asphalt Base – 25 mm

8 inches – Aggregate Base

	Industrial and Commercial Mixture Type B	1 inch – Asphalt Surface – 9.5 mm

2 inches – Asphalt Intermediate – 19.0 mm

3 inches – Asphalt Base – 25.0 mm

8 inches – Aggregate Base

The aggregate base layer shall consist of INDOT No. 53 aggregate placed and compacted over a properly prepared subgrade as described in AMC 12.10.080. Recycled Portland cement concrete may be used in place of No. 53 aggregate; provided, that it meets the INDOT gradation and class requirements for No. 53 aggregate. The use of recycled Portland cement concrete as aggregate base must be approved by the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer prior to construction.

(C) Concrete Pavements.

(1) All concrete pavements shall be jointed reinforced concrete pavements (JRCP) rather than plain jointed concrete pavements (PCP) unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. A joint plan showing the longitudinal construction joints and sawed transverse joints as well as the corresponding rebar and dowel reinforcement shall be submitted to the City Engineer prior to construction for approval.

(2) The minimum thickness of concrete pavement for residential streets shall be six inches. The minimal thickness of concrete pavement for all industrial and commercial streets shall be eight inches. All concrete pavements shall be underlain by a minimum thickness of four inches of INDOT No. 53 aggregate subbase. Underdrains shall be used if the long-term water level is within two feet of the bottom of the aggregate subbase. Underdrains shall meet the requirements of INDOT Standard Specification 718 and be installed on both sides of the proposed roadway or street. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 4. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.080 Street construction materials and specifications – Pavement construction standards.

(A) No work shall begin until the plans have been approved by the Angola Board of Public Works and Safety, and until the contractor meets with the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer.

(1) Subgrade Preparation. The pavement area shall be adequately stripped to remove all topsoil and any other organic material. Proof rolling shall be performed to locate any soft or loose areas that need to be treated or removed prior to placement of engineered fill or pavement base course materials. Proof rolling should consist of repeated passes of a loaded, pneumatic-tired vehicle such as a tandem-axle dump truck or scraper. All pumping, spongy, and yielding material, which does not readily compact, shall be removed from within slope-stake limits and to such depths as necessary. Alternatively, the use of geogrids and compacted aggregate base (INDOT No. 53) may be used to bridge marginal subgrade. Geogrids shall consist of Tensar TriAx TX140, TX160, or equivalent and shall be placed on the subgrade and covered by a minimum of 12 inches of INDOT No. 53 aggregate.

(2) All excavations shall be adequately shored to avoid damage to the existing pavement structure, its approaches, adjacent roadway, embankments, tracks, buildings, or other property.

(3) All rock greater than six inches in diameter shall be removed or broken off at least six inches below the subgrade surface. Holes or depressions resulting from the removal of unsuitable material shall be filled with either INDOT No. 53 aggregate or INDOT No. 2 stone choked with two inches of INDOT No. 53 stone or B borrow material and compacted to conform to the surrounding subgrade. During subgrade preparation, adequate drainage shall be provided at all times to prevent water from standing on the subgrade.

(4) The subgrade shall be constructed uniformly transversely across the width of the pavement including shoulders or curbs unless shown otherwise on the plans by compacting the soil to 95 percent of the maximum dry density determined by a modified Proctor per AASHTO T-180. Final grading must be performed by a motor grader or CMI machine rather than a bulldozer or other equipment.

(5) The subgrade shall be checked by the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer for conformance to the approved plans. The contractor may not place any subbase, compacted fill or aggregate on the subgrade until approved by both the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer. See AMC 12.10.100 if soil modification/stabilization is needed.

(B) Fill Placement and Compaction.

(1) All fill should be clean and free of organic material, debris, deleterious materials and frozen soils. Samples of the proposed fill materials should be tested prior to initiating the earthwork and backfilling operations to determine the classification, the natural and optimum moisture contents and maximum dry density and overall suitability as a fill.

(2) All grade-raise fill shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density determined by a modified Proctor per AASHTO T-180. To achieve the recommended compaction of the structural fill, the fill should be placed and compacted in layers not exceeding eight inches in loose thickness.

(3) Care must be exercised during grading and fill placement operations. The combination of heavy construction equipment traffic and excess surface moisture can cause pumping and deterioration of the near surface soils. The severity of this potential problem depends to a great extent on the weather conditions prevailing during construction. The contractor must exercise discretion when selecting equipment sizes and also make a concerted effort to control construction traffic and surface water while the subgrade soils are exposed. Heavy construction equipment (i.e., dump trucks, scrapers, etc.) shall be rerouted away from the pavement areas when possible.

(C) Asphalt Pavements. Asphalt should be placed and compacted in lifts no greater than three and one-half inches in loose thickness. Tack coats shall be applied in accordance with INDOT Standard Specification No. 406. The HMA mixture shall be compacted with proper equipment, which includes: three wheel, pneumatic tire, tandem, or vibratory roller. Suggested number of passes for each lift at a maximum of two and one-half miles per hour is listed below, but compaction needs to be approved by a field density test (per AMC 12.10.100).

(1) Three wheel – two to four passes.

(2) Pneumatic tire – two to four passes.

(3) Tandem – two passes.

(4) Vibratory roller – six passes.

(D) Concrete Pavements.

(1) The concrete mix and producer must be approved by the City Engineer before construction begins. Concrete shall not be placed on frozen subbase and shall be placed when the ambient temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit and above. Placement of concrete pavements shall be by the slip form or formed methods. Concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated against the faces of all forms or adjacent concrete surfaces. Hand placed concrete shall be thoroughly consolidated with the use of a vibrator. Vibrators shall not operate in any one location to bring excessive mortar to the surface, and shall not come in contact with a dowel bar assembly, subgrade, subbase, or forms. Forms may be removed as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently.

(2) The paver shall spread, consolidate, and shape the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass to provide a dense and homogeneous pavement. The paver shall be of sufficient weight and power to construct the specified JRCP, at an adequate variable forward speed, and without transverse, longitudinal, or vertical instability. The paver shall be equipped with an automated steering and elevation control system.

(3) The paver shall consolidate by vibrating the concrete for the full width and depth of the pavement. Vibration shall be accomplished by internal vibrators, which have a variable frequency range of 7,000 to 12,000 vibrations per minute. The amplitude of vibration shall be between 0.025 inches and 0.06 inches. The vibrators shall be spaced and operated to achieve acceptable consolidation.

(4) The contractor shall be responsible for the protection of the existing joints from the intrusion of fresh concrete mortar, and for any damage to existing pavement caused by the operation of mechanical equipment. Concrete materials that fall on or are worked into the joints or surface tines of an existing slab shall be removed immediately. Concrete shall not be mixed, placed, or finished when the natural light is insufficient. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 5. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.090 Street construction materials and specifications – Quality control/quality assurance.

Construction field-testing shall be performed by an independent commercial testing laboratory hired by the city of Angola. QC/QA shall be performed throughout the construction phase of the project to ensure quality standards. The following standards shall be followed unless specified otherwise by the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer.

(A) Field density tests shall be performed on compacted base aggregate to make sure proper compaction is reached. Field density tests shall be performed in place using a nondestructive nuclear gage method in accordance with ASTM D6938-10. Frequency of compaction tests shall be no less than every 200 feet in alternating lanes if a two-lane roadway or no less than 200 feet in each direction for a multi-lane roadway on each lift of fill and the required compaction must be obtained on each lift before placing another lift. The location of the compaction tests shall be determined by the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer.

(B) Field density tests shall also be performed on asphalt pavement materials to make sure proper compaction is reached. Field density tests shall be performed in place using a nondestructive nuclear gage method with a frequency at the rate of one test every 200 feet per lane for each asphalt course.

(C) For concrete pavements, an American Concrete Institute (ACI) certified concrete field testing technician, Grade I, should be on site to direct all sampling and testing. The fresh concrete shall be monitored during placement for conformance with the plans and specifications. Testing shall include slump, air content and ambient and concrete temperature for each 100 cubic yards (or fraction thereof) of fresh concrete in accordance with the appropriate AASHTO test method listed below.

(1) Air test: AASHTO T-152 or ASTM C-173.

(2) Making and curing test specimens: AASHTO T-23.

(3) Sampling fresh concrete: AASHTO T-141.

(4) Slump: AASHTO T-119.

(D) In addition, four test cylinders shall be cast for compression testing. Two of the cylinders shall be tested at seven days, and two tested at 21 days.

(E) The contractor and City Engineer will conduct an inspection of the new pavement for any damage, including freezing or random cracks. The inspection and all necessary repairs shall be completed prior to opening the pavement to nonconstruction traffic. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 6. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]


12.10.100 Street construction materials and specifications – Soil modification/stabilization.

(A) The purpose of subgrade modification is to create a working platform for construction equipment, which is commonly performed when the subgrade consists of moist soft clays or moist loose granular soils. If the in situ moisture content is more than four percent higher than the optimum moisture content, soil modification shall be required. If conditions allow, the moisture content of the subgrade shall be lowered by scarification and air-drying. Otherwise, the use of chemical treatment as indicated in Table 12.10.100 shall be performed. The purpose of subgrade stabilization is to enhance the strength of the subgrade. As indicated in AMC 12.10.060(D)(2), soil stabilization shall be used if the CBR is less than two or the resilient modulus is less than 3,000 psi. The pavement design engineer should refer to the Design Procedures for Soil Modification or Stabilization by INDOT for details regarding both soil modification and stabilization. The minimum pavement sections indicated in Table 12.10.100 shall still apply even if the soil is modified or stabilized as described below.

(B) When chemical modification or stabilization of subgrade soils is being required, the following criteria may be used for chemical selection based on the index properties of the soils.

Table 12.10.100 Criteria for Chemical Selection  

	Subgrade Conditions	Chemical for Modification/Stabilization	Typical Quantity by Weight (%)

	Clay content > 20% and PI > 10	Quick or Hydrated Lime	4 to 6

	Clay content ≤ 20% and PI ≤ 10	Cement	3 to 6

(C) Note that blends of lime and Class C fly ash, or cement and Class C fly ash, may also be used based on laboratory testing. The Eades and Grim pH test shall be used to determine the optimum lime content. Laboratory testing shall be performed to determine the appropriate chemical mixture rates and how the soil reacts with the proposed chemicals, especially swelling. The laboratory results must be submitted to the City Engineer for final approval for use in the project. When soil modification is used, it shall be required for the full roadbed width including shoulders or curbs.

(D) The chemical modifier shall be stored and handled in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mixing of the chemical modifier and soil shall be performed by rotary speed mixers or disc harrow to a depth of 14 inches until a uniform mixture is obtained. Compaction shall begin as soon as practical after mixing. Lime modified soils shall be compacted within 24 hours after mixing, and cement modified soils shall be compacted within three hours after mixing. Proofrolling of the treated subgrade is required before placing aggregate base or new fill. Additional testing using a dynamic cone penetrometer may be required as directed by the Street Commissioner and the City Engineer. Pavement materials may not be placed until curing is complete. Additional guidance may be obtained from the INDOT Standard Specifications, Section 215. [Ord. 1473-2014 § 7. Code 2000 § 150.51(C).]

More specifically, no industrial user shall discharge any waste stream with a closed cup flash point of less than 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR Section 261.21. The Superintendent may require industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable, combustible or explosive substances to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter or explosion hazard meter. No two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge shall be more than five percent, nor any one reading more than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.

(4) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems.

(5) Garbage that has not been properly ground.

(6) Ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, wood, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, paunch manure, butchers’ offal or any other solid or viscous substances capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the proper operation of the sewerage system or the wastewater treatment plant.

(7) Waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.0 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or posing hazards to the structures, equipment or personnel of the sewage works.

(8) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction in the sewage system or otherwise cause interference to the POTW.

(9) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such a half-life or concentration that they do not comply with limits established by the city or other regulations set forth by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, state of Indiana or that violate any federal standards.

(10) Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (CBOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause pass through or interference with the POTW.

(11) Any waters or wastes containing suspended solids of such character and quantity that unusual provision, attention or expense would be required to handle such materials at the wastewater treatment plant, its pumping stations or other facilities.

(12) Stormwater drainage from ground resulting in infiltration and inflow (I&I) through the industrial user’s service line(s), surface, roof drains, catch basins, unroofed area drains (e.g., commercial car washing facilities) or any other source unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. Specifically prohibited is the connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to the city’s wastewater collection system. No person shall connect or discharge water from underground drains, sump pump discharges, natural springs and seeps, water accumulated in excavation or grading or any other water associated with construction activities.

(13) A slug discharge as defined in AMC 13.10.020.

(14) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.

(15) Trucked or hauled pollutants except as authorized by the Superintendent and only at discharge points designated by the Superintendent.

(20) Any water contaminated as a result of discharge from aboveground and/or underground gasoline, diesel fuels, fuel oil, kerosene, jet fuel tanks, tank accessories, and/or pipelines without applying for and obtaining a permit prior to discharge.

(21) Any pollutant or wastewater containing pollutants with UV (254 nm) absorbing substances which causes interference with UV disinfection at the treatment plant.

(C) Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW except as authorized by an industrial user permit and/or this chapter. If the industrial user has a pretreatment facility, all floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user’s pretreatment facility or to sumps or tanks that do not have the potential for a discharge to the POTW before connecting with the POTW. The city may require other industrial users to contain or collect wastewater from floor drains to protect the POTW and meet the objectives of this chapter.

(D) Specific Discharge Limitations. It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user or other permitted nonsignificant industrial user to discharge, deposit, cause, or allow to be discharged any waste or wastewater which fails to comply with the limitations imposed by this section.

(1) Dilution is prohibited as a substitute for treatment and shall be a violation of this chapter. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

Penalty: See AMC 13.10.610.


13.10.270 Sample collection and analytical methods.

(A) Sample Collection. Compliance determinations with respect to prohibitions and limitations in this chapter may be made based on either grab or composite samples of wastewater as specified by the city. Such samples shall be taken at a point or points which the city determines to be suitable for obtaining a representative sample of the discharge. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined by the city to meet specific circumstances.

(B) Sample Type. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

(1) Except as indicated in subsections (B)(2) and (3) of this section, the industrial user must collect representative wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is required by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the permitted discharge.

(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composited samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous local limits, including pH.

(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in AMC 13.10.300, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical representative sampling data do not exist. Where historical data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by AMC 13.10.300, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(C) Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an industrial discharge permit application, report, permit or other analyses required under this chapter shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties approved by the EPA.

(D) Records shall include for all samples:

(1) The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples;

(2) The date(s) analyses were performed;

(3) Who performed the analyses;

(4) The analytical techniques/methods used, including method detection limits and QA/QC sample results;

(5) Calibration and maintenance records;

(6) All chain-of-custody records; and

(7) The results of such analyses. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 822, 1992; Ord. 789, 1990; Ord. 780, 1989; Ord. 692, 1986. Code 2000 § 51.053; Code 1981 §§ 13.24.180, 13.24.190 and 13.24.200.]


13.10.280 Modifications – Time schedule for compliance.

The authority reserves the right to amend this chapter and its terms and conditions in order to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers regulated under such standards unless the POTW allows for the application of a removal credit allowance as defined at 40 CFR Section 403.7. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 1507-2015; Ord. 692, 1986. Code 2000 § 51.054; Code 1981 § 13.24.220.]


13.10.290 Revocation of treatment services.

The authority may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to any discharger which:

(A) Fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

(B) Fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics;

(C) Refuses reasonable access to the discharger’s premises by representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or

(D) Violates the conditions of this article or any final judicial order entered with respect to provisions of this article. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 692, 1986. Code 2000 § 51.055; Code 1981 § 13.24.230.]


13.10.300 Reports.

(A) Compliance Schedule. Any noncategorical industry which is not in compliance with the city’s limitations must develop a compliance schedule during which time the industry must meet the city’s standards. The schedule should contain increments of progress (hiring engineers, starting construction and the like) which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the operation of pretreatment equipment to meet the city’s pretreatment standards. All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports.

(B) Compliance Schedule Reports (Categorical Industries). These reporting conditions apply to the compliance schedule required in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(7). This schedule is necessary whenever an industrial user is not meeting categorical pretreatment standards at the time of promulgation of that standard. The schedule contains increments of progress (hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction and the like) which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards.

(C) Monthly Reports. This requirement calls for the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users that are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. These reports will normally be required on a monthly basis.

(D) Baseline Report.

(1) Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW will be required to submit to the control authority a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR Sections 403.12(b)(1) through (b)(7).

(2) Upon promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard, the control authority (either EPA, state or POTW) will provide the appropriate 12(b) forms for distribution to the industrial users who are affected by the promulgated standard. The industrial users are then required to submit the completed report to the control authority.

(E) Compliance Date Report.

(1) Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard, any industrial user subject to those standards must submit to the control authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge generated from the regulated process which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards.

(2) The report must also state whether applicable standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharge into compliance. This statement should be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user.

(F) Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance. Any discharger subject to an applicable pretreatment standard must submit to the authority during the months of June and December, or more frequently if required by the authority, following the final compliance date of that pretreatment standard, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the discharge which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report must include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows are to be reported on the basis of actual measurement, except, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating factors, may authorize submission of the reports on months other than those specified above.

(G) Signatory Certification. All reports and other submittals required to be submitted to the city shall include the following statement and signatory requirements:

(1) The authorized representative of the industrial user signing any application, questionnaire, any report or other information required to be submitted to the city must sign and attach the following certification statement with each such report or information submitted to the city:

I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system or the persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.

(2) If the authorized representative is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of AMC 13.10.020 must be submitted to the city prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 692, 1986. Code 2000 § 51.056; Code 1981 §§ 13.24.240, 13.24.250, 13.24.260, 13.24.270, 13.24.280 and 13.24.290.]

13.10.420 Surcharge provisions.

(A) Surcharge Based on Waste Concentration. Each industrial user who discharges industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be subject to a surcharge, in addition to the regular sewerage service charge, based on both the biochemical oxygen demand (or on the chemical oxygen demand where CBOD cannot be determined) and the suspended solids content of the wastes, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following:

(1) A carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) in excess of 200 mg/L; or where CBOD cannot be determined, then, in lieu of CBOD, a chemical oxygen demand (COD) in excess of 400 mg/L;

(2) A total suspended solid (TSS) in excess of 250 mg/L;

(3) Phosphorous in excess of 10 mg/L;

(4) Ammonia in excess of 20 mg/L.

(B) Surcharge – Computation. The surcharge shall be determined as follows:

(1) The excess pounds of CBOD, COD, phosphorous, TSS and ammonia will be computed by multiplying the customer’s billing sewage volume, measured in units of 100 cubic feet for the current billing period, by the factor of 0.0062321, and multiplying that product by the difference between the concentration, measured in milligrams per liter, of the CBOD (or COD), phosphorous, TSS, and ammonia, respectively, in the customer’s sewage and the allowed constituent.

(2) The allowed constituent will be determined by multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the rate of surcharge set out in subsection (C) of this section.

(C) Surcharge – Rate. The rate of surcharge for each constituent shall be as follows:

(1) For carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), $0.12 per pound;

(2) For chemical oxygen demand (COD) where CBOD cannot be determined, $0.12 per pound;

(3) For total suspended solids, $0.12 per pound;

(4) For phosphorous, $3.63 per pound;

(5) For ammonia, $0.36 per pound.

(D) Surcharge – Review. As appropriate, the city shall evaluate the treatment costs for removing CBOD, COD, TSS, phosphorus and ammonia from the wastewater treatment plant in order that the Board of Public Works may determine whether the current rates or surcharges charged for excess pollutant loading charges to industrial users are adequate or should be changed. [Ord. 1599-2018; Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 1016-2000; Ord. 876, 1994; Ord. 822, 1992; Ord. 789, 1990; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.083; Code 1981 §§ 13.28.080, 13.28.090, 13.28.100 and 13.28.110.]

The charges for sewerage service shall be billed to the person being billed for water service unless, by contract with the utility, another person assumes such responsibility. If a tenant is billed, the owner shall in no way be relieved of liability in the event payment is not made by the tenant as required. The owner shall have the right to examine the city’s collection records to ascertain whether such charges have been paid.

(C) Billing Period for New Customers. The rates, charges and surcharges fixed in this chapter shall be extended to and cover any additional premises hereafter served without the need for any hearing or notice. If the first billing to a new customer covers a period other than a full billing month, then the service charges for the billing shall be made in keeping with standard practice in the water utility. Subsequent sewerage service billings shall be for periods coinciding with the billing periods for water service. If such rates, charges and/or surcharges are changed, the first billing after the change may also be for a period other than a full billing month in order to keep the sewerage billing periods coincident with the water billing periods.

13.10.440 Summer sewer relief.

(A) In order that residential sewage users shall not be penalized for watering lawns and other summer-type water usage during the months of June, July, and August (the “summer sewer relief period”), the sewer charges for such sewer services shall be calculated by adding together the consumption for the previous months billed of February, March, and April and dividing by three. The result of this calculation shall constitute the number of gallons of consumption that will be charged to the residential user for sewer services during the summer sewer relief period.

(B) In the event the residential sewage user is not billed the previous months of February, March, and April, summer sewer relief does not apply.

(C) In the event the calculation is greater than the water usage of June, July, and August, then the charge for sewer service shall be calculated on the actual water used in the month for which the sewage service bill is rendered.

(D) Summer sewer relief shall not apply to any premises that are wholly or partially used for commercial or industrial purposes. In the event a portion of such premises shall be used for commercial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of the premises is served through a separate water meter, and in such case the water usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for residential purposes would qualify for summer sewer relief. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 1174-2004. Code 2000 § 51.085.]


13.10.450 Waste haulers.

(B) The rate charged to the persons or entities whose waste is accepted for disposal is $0.085 per gallon.

(C) The Superintendent is authorized to establish the forms, policy, and procedure to implement this section. [Ord. 1599-2018; Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 1101-2002. Code 2000 § 51.086.]


13.10.460 Delinquencies.

(A) Payments, Due Dates and Charges.

(1) Charges for sewer service levied pursuant to this chapter shall be due and payable on or before the due date shown on the bill. Any service charge not paid by the due date, approximately 20 days after the bill is rendered, shall be considered delinquent.

(a) That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on the bill.

(b) That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, and the next monthly billing indicates a past due balance of $40.00 or more from the previous month, a disconnect notice will be mailed stating that if the bill for both months is not paid in full within 20 days of the date of the disconnect notice, service will be discontinued for nonpayment.

(c) That any customer disputing the correctness of the bill shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.

(d) That any customer disputing the disconnect notice and discontinuance of service may request a hearing within 10 days of the date of the past due utility bill notice. The hearing request must be submitted in writing and addressed to Clerk-Treasurer, 210 North Public Square, Angola, Indiana, 46703. The hearing will be scheduled and conducted by the Board of Public Works and Safety. Notice of the time and place of the hearing will be sent by first class mail to the billing address of record and, if different, to the service address. Service will continue until a decision is issued.

(2) The city shall have no liability or responsibility to provide service to any user, residence, or business where there exists an outstanding bill.

(a) If a final bill is owed by a renter, s/he will not be allowed another utility service until the final bill is paid in full;

(b) If an owner of a property owes a final bill either in his or her name or the uncollected sewer, stormwater, or trash portion of a final bill in a previous renter’s name, utility service will be denied for the property until the final bill is paid in full.

(3) Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only questions of proper and correct billing and whether or not the service should be disconnected will be considered. In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.

(4) When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on charge as established by the Common Council.

(5) In the event a customer is a critical facility, utility service will not be disconnected until the customer is contacted by phone or email. Critical facilities are defined as:

The user shall have 72 hours to fill the pool at which time the resident shall notify the Clerk-Treasurer/utility office as to the concluding reading on the water meter. Provided the user complies with these conditions, the residential sewage user shall not be assessed a sewer charge on the gallons used to fill the pool.

(4) After May 15th, if the residential sewage user qualifies for summer sewer relief, that relief will apply for the gallons used to fill the pool for the summer sewer relief period.

(B) New Lawn/Landscaping.

(1) In order that residential sewage users shall not be penalized for maintaining a new lawn/landscaping, for the gallons used to maintain the lawn/landscaping, the user shall be entitled to maintain the new lawn/landscaping for a period of one year without assessment of a monthly sewer charge based on gallons used or estimated to be used for maintaining the new lawn/landscaping.

(2) In the event the residential sewage user has compiled a history of water usage of at least six billing months, the sewer charges shall be calculated based on the average usage billed that six months. The result of this average calculation shall constitute the number of gallons of consumption that will be charged monthly to the residential user for sewer charges during the one-year period.

(3) In the event the residential sewage user has not compiled a history of water usage in order to determine the sewage charge, the sewer charges shall be calculated by determining the number of user residents in the household multiplied by 2,000 (maximum average water use per person). The result of this calculation shall constitute the number of gallons of consumption that will be charged monthly to the residential user for sewer charges during the one-year period.

(4) Any residential sewage user desiring to maintain a new lawn/landscaping without assessment of a sewer charge on the gallons used shall serve notice to the Clerk-Treasurer/utility office and state the user name and address. The Clerk-Treasurer/utility office will order a site visit to verify the notice.

Any discharger notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or any discharger’s wastewater permit must, within a reasonable period of time as determined by the authority, cease all discharges. If the discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority must immediately commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger’s compliance with the order. The authority can reinstate the wastewater permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings, provided the discharger can prove the elimination of the noncomplying discharge of conditions as outlined in this section. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.101; Code 1981 § 13.20.260.]


13.10.530 Revocation of permit.

The authority may revoke the permit of any discharger failing to:

(A) Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

(B) Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics;

(C) Refuses reasonable access to his or her premises by representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or

(D) Violates the conditions of this permit, the city’s ordinance or any final judicial order. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.102; Code 1981 § 13.20.270.]


13.10.540 Show cause hearing.

Where a violation of the city’s ordinance or of applicable pretreatment regulations occurs and is not corrected by timely compliance, the proposed permit revocation action should not be taken. A written notice must be served on the discharger by personal service, certified or registered mail, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the authority. The hearing will consider the violation, the proposed enforcement action, reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken and directing the discharger to show cause before the authority as to why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing must be served no less than 10 days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing will be considered by the authority and appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger will be issued. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.103; Code 1981 § 13.20.280.]


13.10.550 Legal action.

If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into a city’s wastewater disposal system contrary to the municipal ordinance, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the City Attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the circuit court of the county. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.104; Code 1981 § 13.20.290.]


13.10.560 Annual publication of violators.

A list of all dischargers which were the subject of significant enforcement proceedings pursuant to provisions of a municipal ordinance or state or federal regulations during the previous calendar year must be published annually by the authority in the largest daily newspaper in the municipality in which the authority is located. The article should summarize the enforcement actions taken against the dischargers during the calendar year in which violations remained uncorrected 45 or more days after notification of noncompliance, or which have exhibited a pattern of noncompliance over that one-year period, or which involve failure to accurately report noncompliance. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.105; Code 1981 § 13.20.300.]


13.10.570 Discharger’s right to appeal.

Any discharger or any interested party has the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by a municipal ordinance and is entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such an inquiry is by the affected discharger and deals with matters of compliance with the ordinance or deals with a wastewater permit, receipt of the discharger’s request will delay all enforcement proceedings until he receives the written reply. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.106; Code 1981 § 13.20.310.]

(A) Any discharger that experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter or a wastewater permit must inform the authority within 24 hours of the upset occurrence. When such information is given orally, a written report must be sent to the authority within five days. The report must specify:

(1) The description of the upset, the cause and the upset’s impact on the discharger’s compliance status;

(2) The duration of noncompliance, including times and dates of noncompliance; and

(3) The steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an upset.

(B) A documented and verified operating upset can be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the authority against a discharger for noncompliance if the requirements of 40 CFR Section 403.16(c) are met. [Ord. 1598-2018; Ord. 662, 1984. Code 2000 § 51.107; Code 1981 § 13.20.320.]

Article I. General Provisions


13.15.010 Purpose.

(A) It is recognized that storm sewers and their respective receiving drainage ditches, tiles, streams, channels, wetlands, lakes, and other drainage ways serving the city of Angola may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting when land use changes from agricultural or other open uses to a more urbanized use covering previous uncovered or undeveloped land. It is further recognized that deposits of sediment from developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving streams and lakes.

(B) Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater.

(C) Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of stream-beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.

(D) A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the city of Angola and all the people of the state of Indiana, their resources, and the environment.

(E) Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.

(F) Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.

(G) Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

(H) Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the state of Indiana by the city of Angola.

(I) Therefore, it shall be the policy of the city of Angola adopted by the Common Council and administered by the Board of Public Works and Safety (the Board) that the storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion and sediment shall be required of all new development, any redevelopment, and other new construction in the city, including residential subdivisions and planned unit developments and the paving of areas that were previously undeveloped or stone/gravel materials. Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each project be discussed with the City Engineer’s office or the MS4 operator at the earliest practical time in the planning stage. [Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.01.]


13.15.020 Conflicting ordinances.

The provisions of this article shall be deemed as additional requirements to minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city. In the case of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply. When stormwater runoff from proposed developments, redevelopments, and other new construction will outlet directly to a Steuben County legal drain, or other natural drainage way, the proposed development, redevelopment and other new construction may also need to comply with the Steuben County Ordinance for Storm Drainage and Erosion Control. The Board may therefore also require a letter from the Steuben County Drainage Board indicating that the stormwater and erosion and sediment control plans have been submitted to and approved by the Steuben County Drainage Board. [Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.02.]


13.15.030 Compliance with other ordinances.

In addition to the requirements of this article, compliance with the requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvements plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections, appeals and similar matters, and compliance with applicable state of Indiana statutes and regulations shall be required. No building permit shall be issued for the construction, extension, remodeling, alteration or repair of any proposed or existing building in the city or within the city’s jurisdictional area, until a site improvement permit has been issued for the proposed site of the regulated building activity by the MS4 operator, or the MS4 operator has determined that the proposed regulated building activity is exempt. [Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.03.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.040 Site improvement permits.

(A) No construction activity of any type, including clearing, grubbing, earthmoving, excavating, grading, filling, concrete paving, bituminous paving, or other impervious surfacing, utility installation, and any and all other land disturbing or land altering activity or building construction or erection activity of any type may begin until the owner of record (owner of the land upon which the activities described above are taking place) for the project, or the owner’s designee by written document, has obtained a site improvement permit from the city of Angola’s municipal separate storm sewer (MS4) operator. In new subdivisions, the owner(s) of the subdivision must obtain the site improvement permit(s) for all new utility main line construction, including sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water supply, natural gas, electric, telephone, cable television, and any other utility providing service. On commercial and industrial projects the owner(s) must obtain the site improvement permit for all new utility main line and lateral construction, including sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water supply, natural gas, electric, telephone, cable television, and any other utility providing service. On residential projects the owner(s) must obtain the site improvement permit for all new utility lateral construction, including sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water supply, natural gas, electric, telephone, cable television, and any other utility laterals.

(B) Speculative builders that have an arrangement with the land owner(s) regarding transfer of the building site when the building or home is sold will be the person(s) responsible for obtaining the site improvement permit. In all other areas than those described above, where utilities are being installed, whether it be private property, public roadways, or public or private easements, the site improvement permit must be obtained by an authorized employee of the utility and not a contract representative or subcontractor.

(C) Stormwater control systems, erosion, and sediment control systems are required for all new construction and whenever lots and other parcels of land are being cleared, graded, paved, or improved.

(D) No site improvement permit is required for the following activities:

(1) Any emergency activity, which is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property, or natural resources.

(2) Existing nursery and agricultural operations.

(3) State, municipal or county public works projects and road or street construction or maintenance activities. However, the stormwater control and erosion and sediment control requirements must still be complied with.

(13) Proposed Erosion and Sediment Control Features.

(a) Details of the areas to be cleared and details of the area where natural vegetation and natural vegetated buffer strips will be retained.

(b) A detailed schedule of the proposed construction phasing. Phasing is the clearing and grading of a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the stabilization of each phase before beginning the next phase.

(c) Temporary erosion control measures, necessary during the initial construction and establishment phases up to final site grading and seeding.

(d) A permanent erosion control plan of all the graded and non-hard surface areas within the proposed development, as planned for completion, up to and including seeding of the final lot on which business or residential dwellings are to be placed.

(e) Details concerning removal of temporary erosion control devices after the initial establishment of adequate vegetative cover.

(f) Maintenance procedures and responsible parties, as part of the continuing plan to keep all of the land under adequate cover and erosion at an acceptable minimum.

[Ord. 1438-2013; Ord. 1349-2010; Ord. 1183-2004; Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.04.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.050 Stormwater control information and design requirements.

(A) Exceptions. The central business district is exempt from the stormwater provisions of this article. Estate residential (ER), single-family residential (R1 – R3), and multi-family residential (R4 – R5) construction or development that is not included within a platted subdivision is exempt from the stormwater provisions of this article unless the maximum ground coverage for the proposed construction exceeds the maximum ground coverage specified in the respective zoning district. In that case the stormwater runoff from the area exceeding the maximum ground coverage specified is subject to the provisions of this article. The central business district, ER, and R1 – R5 zoning areas are not exempt from the requirement to apply for and obtain a site improvement permit.

(B) Existing Impervious Area.

(1) The designer shall show on the site plan, in tabular form, the total existing or preconstruction impervious area, in square feet or acres (43,560 square feet per acre), that exists on the site in its present or preconstruction or predevelopment condition.

(2) For the purpose of this article, any building, bituminous or concrete paved area, and other hard surface areas are assumed impervious.

(3) For the purpose of this article, areas comprised of stone, gravel, cinder, brick, compacted aggregate, or other ornamental, natural or unnatural aggregates, will be reduced by 25 percent, or calculated to be 75 percent impervious. For example, 100-square-foot area of gravel parking area will be considered to consist of 75 square feet of impervious area.

(4) When other areas and other materials exist that are less than 100 percent impervious, the designer may propose other reductions to the impervious area based upon values from Table 3.2.3 for the rational method, as presented in the HERPICC Stormwater Drainage Manual, July 1994. The Board will make the final determination in all matters regarding calculations of the impervious area.

(C) Proposed Impervious Area. The designer shall show on the site plan, in tabular form, the proposed post construction impervious area in square feet or acres (43,560 square feet per acre), for the site in its proposed post-construction or post-development condition.

(D) Required Stormwater Storage Area. The proposed impervious area minus the existing impervious area equals the required stormwater storage area.

(E) Required Stormwater Storage Volume.

(1) The required stormwater storage area (in square feet) times 0.125 feet (one and one-half inches) equals the required stormwater storage volume in cubic feet.

(2) The Board reserves the right to require additional stormwater storage volume if the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system is limited or inadequate.

(3) Required stormwater storage volume in cubic feet divided by 43,560 equals required stormwater volume in acre-feet.

(F) Stormwater Storage Methods.

(1) The required stormwater storage volume must be detained on site by the provisions of appropriate wet or dry bottom reservoirs, by underground tanks or pipes, by storage on flat roofs, parking areas, lawns or other acceptable techniques.

(2) Measures which retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels shall also be used to partially control runoff rates.

(G) Stormwater Release Rate.

(1) The allowable release rate varies for each site because the allowable release rate is dependent upon the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system.

(2) If the required stormwater storage volume is being detained in an area used by the public, for example in a parking lot, it will generally be the policy of the Board to allow a release rate which empties a full detention area in two to four hours.

(3) If the required stormwater storage volume is being detained in an area not critical to public use, for example a dry bottom reservoir, it will generally be the policy of the Board to allow a release rate which empties a full detention area in eight to 12 hours.

(4) It will generally be the policy of the Board that the stormwater release rate shall not result in storage duration in excess of 48 hours unless additional storms occur within the same 48-hour period.

(5) The Board will make the final determination in all matters regarding allowable release rates.

(H) General Detention Basin Design Requirements.

(1) The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored (without a permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet unless a six-foot-high fence protects the basin.

(2) All stormwater detention facilities shall be separated by not less than 25 feet from any occupied building or structure.

(3) Safety screens having a maximum opening of four inches shall be provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from crawling into the structures.

(4) Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn of deep water, possible flood conditions during storm periods and other dangers that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed necessary by the Board.

(5) Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply as possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the stormwater release rate.

(6) Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall be provided in case the normal discharge devices become totally or partially inoperative. The overflow facility shall have a stable outlet structure and be of such design that its operation is automatic and does not require manual attention.

(7) Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided throughout the entire detention storage basin area. Grass shall be cut regularly at approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required to maintain the facility.

(8) Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to design.

(9) No detention facility or other water storage area, permanent or temporary, shall be constructed under or within 10 feet of any pole or high voltage electric line. Likewise, poles or high voltage electric lines shall not be placed within 10 feet of any detention facility or other water storage facility.

(10) Detention facilities must maintain setbacks from private and public water supply facilities as prescribed by Indiana State Board of Health and the recommended standards for water works by the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State and Provincial Public Health and Environmental Managers.

(11) The top of all banks (the point where the pond’s back slope meets finished grade) and the toe of all fill slopes shall be a minimum of 10 feet from all property lines.

(12) Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional six percent of available capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from development and to permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific locations so that removal costs are kept to a minimum.

(I) Dry Bottom Facility Design Requirements. Detention facilities which will not contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following requirements:

(1) Provisions shall be incorporated into facilities for complete interior drainage of dry bottom facilities, including the provisions of natural grades to outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facility, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.

(2) The detention facility shall, whenever possible, be designed to serve as a secondary or multipurpose function.

(3) In excavated detention facilities, side slopes of 3:1 or flatter shall be provided for stability. In the event of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered stable.

(J) Wet Bottom Facility Design Requirements. Where part of a detention facility will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items required for general and dry bottom detention storage shall apply except that the system of drains required to maintain a dry bottom facility will not be required. A controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain the design water level in the wet bottom facility and provide required detention storage above the design water level. However, the following additional conditions shall apply:

(1) Facilities designed with permanent pools or containing permanent lakes shall have a water area of at least one-half acre. If fish are to be used to keep the pond clean, a minimum depth of approximately 10 feet shall be maintained over at least 25 percent of the pond area. The remaining lake area shall have no extensive shallow areas, except as required by subsection (J)(3) of this section.

(2) In excavated lakes, the underwater side slopes in the lake shall be stable. In the event of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered stable.

(3) A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and shall be installed in all lakes approximately 30 to 36 inches below the permanent water level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18 inches above the permanent water line shall be provided.

Details of such design to be included in the building permit application shall include the depth and volume of storage, details of outlet devices and downdrains, elevations of emergency overflow provisions and certification of the structural portion of the building design plans by a professional engineer or architect.

(L) Parking Lot Storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage of stormwaters on all or a portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters slowly. Depths of storage shall be limited to a maximum of eight inches in vehicle parking areas so as to limit damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles is not impaired.

(M) Underground Tanks or Pipes. Detention storage requirements may be met in total or in part by detention in underground tank(s) or in a network of underground pipes. Tanks must be of reinforced concrete construction unless otherwise approved by the Board. Pipes must be reinforced concrete or dual wall (corrugated exterior/smooth interior) high-density polyethylene (HDPE) materials unless otherwise approved by the Board. Details of the underground storage system and the outlet or release structure(s) are to be included in the building permit application.

(N) Retention Basins. Retention basins (no outlet) are considered a last resort system. The Board may require the construction of a suitable outlet to prevent the use of retention basins. A retention basin will not be considered unless infiltration wells, dry wells, or other subsurface absorption system is proposed in conjunction with the retention well.

(O) Facility Financial Responsibilities. The construction cost of stormwater control systems and required facilities shall be accepted as part of the cost of land development.

(P) Facility Maintenance Responsibilities. Maintenance of detention/retention facilities during construction and thereafter shall be the responsibility of the land developer/owner. Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds, unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body, and shall be determined before the final drainage plans are approved. No building permits will be issued until the documents accepting or assigning maintenance responsibilities has been approved by the City Attorney.

(Q) Inspections. All public and privately owned detention storage facilities may be inspected by representatives of the city.

(R) Corrective Measures. If deficiencies are found by the inspector, the owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to take the necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so, the city will undertake the work and collect the cost of maintenance or repair from the owner using lien rights if necessary.

(S) Joint Development of Control Systems. Stormwater control systems may be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as compliance with this article is maintained.

(T) Installation of Erosion Control Systems. No construction may start until the owner and/or developer and/or contractor and/or other designated representative for the project has obtained a site improvement permit. Runoff and erosion control systems shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development. The city will require an erosion control plan to be submitted as part of the construction plans and specifications.

(U) Detention Facilities in Floodplains. If detention storage is provided within a 100-year floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.

(V) Off-Site Drainage Provisions. When the allowable runoff is released in an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be required to construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert increased flood hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one point instead of the natural overland distribution. The requirement of off-site drains shall be at the discretion of the Board.

(W) As-Built Plans. Whenever the Board has agreed to consider accepting facilities constructed by developers, a professionally prepared (by professional engineer or registered land surveyor), and certified as-built set of prints or plans shall be submitted to the Board for review. [Ord. 1508-2015; Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.05.]

(A) Minimum practices are required at all sites. The following practices, alone or in combination with other practices and dependent upon existing conditions at the site must be implemented in order to comply with this article:

(1) Temporary stone/gravel construction entrance/exit drive. Drive to be constructed 12 feet wide by 50 feet long with adequate radii for one-way traffic. Two-way traffic requires a minimum width of 20 feet. Stone/gravel to be added and maintained as necessary to maintain six inches of clean depth.

(2) Perimeter barriers, for example, silt fence or straw bales are required to protect all downslope project perimeters. Straw bales shall be properly entrenched (bottom of straw bale below the adjacent ground level) and backfilled, with ends of adjacent bales abutting each other, and be securely anchored by at least two wooden stakes or steel rebars driven through each bale into the ground below. Silt fence shall be provided with wooden or steel rebar stakes at a minimum spacing of six feet for reinforced barriers and four feet for nonreinforced barriers. Install silt fence with stakes on the downslope side. Twelve inches of fabric should be installed in an excavated trench four inches wide by eight inches deep. Earth barriers may be used if the downslope sides have temporary seeding installed in accordance with the requirements at subsection (A)(6) of this section.

(3) Protection of existing facilities, e.g., protecting inlets, culverts, or storm drains with straw bales, fabrics, slotted barrels, aggregates, silt-sacks, gutter buddies or other accepted practices outlined in the handbook.

(4) Slope protection, e.g., protecting slopes with temporary seeding or sodding, permanent seeding or sodding, aggregates, fabrics, or erosion control blankets, or turf reinforcement mats.

(5) Installation of nonperforated flexible drainage tile to be used as temporary downspout extenders until seeding is established.

(6) Installation of temporary seeding and timely application or installation of the permanent seeding or sodding. Temporary seeding shall consist of annual ryegrass, perennial ryegrass, oats, wheat, or a mix of the various seeds. Steuben County surveyor’s mix is an example of an acceptable temporary seed mixture. Seeding shall be applied at the rate of 60 pounds per acre. Temporary seeding shall be applied whenever unvegetated areas are scheduled to be left inactive for 15 days or more. Temporary or permanent seeding shall be considered adequate when the vegetative cover is greater than 70 percent of the seeded area.

(7) Soil stockpiles must be stabilized, covered, or protected by perimeter barriers at the end of each workday.

(8) Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site. For example, water trucks may be required to settle dust and sediment from earth-moving operations.

(9) After October 30th, the entire site must be stabilized using a heavy mulch layer, or another Board-approved method, that does not require germination to control erosion.

(B) Failure to implement minimum required practices or the best management practices (BMPs) on the plan approved by the MS4 operator may result in:

(1) Stop work order by the MS4 operator for all work at that site in accordance with the site improvement permit until the required practices or the approved best management practices (BMPs) are implemented.

(2) Stop work order by the MS4 operator for all work at that site in accordance with the site improvement permit until cleanup required by failure to implement minimum expected practices or the approved best management practices (BMPs) is completed. Note: If the city must perform or contract the cleanup due to the failure of the responsible land owner, or developer, or on-site contractor to do so, or due to the existence of an emergency situation caused by runoff, sediment, or other debris from the site, the responsible land owner, developer or contractor will be billed the actual costs of the cleanup plus $500.00 per occurrence.

(3) Revocation of site improvement permit, building permits, or both. The Board reserves the right to revoke either or both permits when the actions of the landowner, developer, or contractor are in total disregard of the provisions of this article. [Ord. 1164-2004. Code 2000 § 54.06.]

(A) Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the city of Angola municipal storm drain system or conveyances any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:

(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated – typically less than one part per million chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.

(2) Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.

(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test.

(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the federal Environmental Protection Agency; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.

(B) Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is in violation of this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. [Ord. 1159-2004. Code 2000 § 54.25.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.160 Suspension of MS4 access.

(A) Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situation. The authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

(B) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.

(C) A person violates this article if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. [Ord. 1159-2004. Code 2000 § 54.26.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.

Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. [Ord. 1159-2004. Code 2000 § 54.27.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.180 Monitoring of discharges.

(A) This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.

(B) Access to Facilities.

(1) The authorized enforcement agent shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to agents of the authorized enforcement agency.

(2) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

(3) The authorized enforcement agent shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge.

(4) The authorized enforcement agent has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.

(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the facility operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the facility operator.

(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agent access to a permitted facility are a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agent reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.

(7) If the authorized enforcement agent has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agent may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. [Ord. 1159-2004. Code 2000 § 54.28.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.190 Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of BMPs.

The Board of Public Works and Safety will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at that person’s expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. [Ord. 1159-2004. Code 2000 § 54.29.]

Penalty: See AMC 13.15.400.


13.15.200 Watercourse protection.

Article III. Regulating Stormwater Quality Management for Post-Construction Operation and Maintenance


13.15.290 Applicability – Exemptions.

(A) The stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the city of Angola municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) operator as part of the stormwater management permit application, must also include post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place following completion of construction activities to continuously treat stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the city of Angola that includes clearing, grading, excavation, concrete or bituminous paving, and other land disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of or impact on one acre or more of total land area, is subject to the requirements of this article. This includes both new development and redevelopment, and disturbances of less than one acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, within the MS4 area.

(B) The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities:

(1) Agricultural land disturbing activities;

(2) Forest harvesting activities;

(3) Construction activities associated with a single-family residential dwelling disturbing less than five acres, when the dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale;

(4) Single-family residential developments consisting of four or less lots;

(5) A single-family residential strip development where the developer offers for sale or lease without land improvements and the project is not part of a larger common plan of development of sale; or

(6) Individual building lots within a larger permitted project.

(C) The requirements under this article do not apply to the following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control measures:

(1) Landfills that have been issued a certification of closure under 329 IAC 10.

(2) Coal mining activities permitted under IC 14-34.

(3) Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting waste pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements, including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.

(D) It will be the responsibility of the project site owner to complete a site improvement permit application and ensure that a sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted to the city of Angola municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) operator in accordance with AMC 13.15.010 et seq. and/or 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5). It will be the responsibility of the project site owner and/or project site owner’s designee to ensure proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs in compliance with this article and with the approved stormwater management permit, and to notify the city of Angola municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) operator with a sufficient notice of termination letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However, all eventual property owners of stormwater quality management facilities meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the requirements of this article. [Ord 1207-2005. Code 2000 § 54.50.]


13.15.300 Policy.

(A) It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to undeveloped areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased infiltration rates, increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other pollutants. As new development and redevelopment continues in the city of Angola, measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater runoff prior to reaching legal drains, streams, rivers, and lakes. Through the use of best management practices (BMPs), stormwater runoff will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants will be removed. The city of Angola has adopted a policy that the control of stormwater quality will be based on the management of total suspended solids (TSS).

(B) (1) The project site owner must submit to the city of Angola MS4 operator a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). The stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must include the following information:

(a) A description of potential pollutant sources from the proposed land use that may reasonably be expected to add a significant amount of pollutants to stormwater discharges.

(b) Location, dimensions, detailed specifications, and construction details of all post-construction stormwater quality measures (BMPs).

(c) A description of measures that will be installed to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction activities have been completed. Such practices include infiltration of runoff, flow reduction by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions, buffer strip and riparian zone preservation, filter strip creation, minimization of land disturbance and surface imperviousness, maximization of open space, and stormwater retention and detention ponds.

(d) A sequence describing when each post-construction stormwater quality measure will be installed.

(e) Stormwater quality measures that will remove or minimize pollutants from stormwater runoff.

(f) Stormwater quality measures that will be implemented to prevent or minimize adverse impacts to stream and riparian habitat.

(g) A narrative description of the maintenance guidelines for all post-construction stormwater quality measures to facilitate their proper long term function. This narrative description shall be made available to future parties who will assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the post-construction stormwater quality measures.

(2) Best management practices (BMPs) shall be as listed in EPA’s “National Menu for BMP Practices for Post-Construction Storm Water Management” or the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual (formerly Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control). The noted BMPs must be designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided in the above referenced menu or manual or as provided by the manufacturer of the stormwater BMP. Practices other than those specified in the preapproved list may be utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance (minimum 80 percent TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of such practices will be placed with the applicant. Details regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such BMPs are available from the International Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) Database developed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The information and data is available at http://www.bmpdatabase.org.

(C) New retail gasoline or diesel fuel outlets, new municipal, state, federal, or institutional gasoline or diesel refueling areas, or new privately owned gasoline or diesel refueling areas, or existing gasoline or diesel outlets and refueling areas that replace their existing tanks or install additional new tanks must install appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. The treatment system installed must be capable of removing 80 percent of floatables, sediments, and oils from the on-site stormwater system before discharging to a city of Angola storm sewer, Steuben County legal drain, or other natural or artificial drainage way. In addition, individual properties that have five acres or more of paved (asphalt, concrete, brick, stone pavers, or other impervious materials) area must install appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and hydrocarbons in stormwater runoff. The treatment system installed must be capable of removing 80 percent of floatables, sediments, and oils from the on-site stormwater system before discharging to a city of Angola storm sewer, Steuben County legal drain, or other natural or artificial drainage way. [Ord. 1207-2005. Code 2000 § 54.51.]


13.15.310 Calculations – Design standards – Specifications.

Calculation of land disturbance should follow the guidelines outlined in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual. The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all stormwater quality management measures or BMPs shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual (formerly Indiana Handbook for Erosion Control). The methods and procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM’s Rule 13. [Ord. 1207-2005. Code 2000 § 54.52.]


13.15.320 Easement requirements.

All stormwater quality management systems, including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems, structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-of-way shall be incorporated into permanent easements. For the purposes of monitoring, inspection, and general maintenance activities, a 25-foot-wide perimeter beyond the actual footprint of the stormwater quality management facility as well as a 25-foot-wide access easement from a public right-of-way to each BMP shall be provided. [Ord. 1207-2005. Code 2000 § 54.53.]

Such investigation shall be initiated immediately upon the occurrence of such fire or explosion; and if it appears that such an occurrence is of a suspicious nature, the Fire Chief or authorized designee shall take charge immediately of the physical evidence relating to the cause or origin of such fire or explosion, take means to prevent access by any person or persons to such buildings, structures or premises until such evidence has been properly processed.

(E) Fire Records – Reports.

(1) The Fire Chief shall keep a record of all fires and facts concerning the same, including investigation findings and statistics and information as to the cause, origin and the extent of such fires and damage caused thereby.

(2) The Fire Chief shall submit a report of each fire occurring within the city and any fire protection contractual areas, to the office of the state Fire Marshal in accordance with IC 36-8-17-7, and in such form as prescribed by that office.

(F) Violations – Orders.

(1) Whenever the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal observes an apparent or actual violation of a provision of this chapter or other ordinances under the Fire Chief’s or Fire Marshal’s jurisdiction, the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal shall prepare a written notice of violation and order describing the condition deemed unsafe and specifying a reasonable time for the required repairs or improvements to be made to correct such violation. The written notice of violation of this chapter shall be served upon the owner, a duly authorized agent or upon the occupant or other person responsible for the conditions under violation. Such notice of violation shall be served either by delivering a copy of same to such person or persons by ordinary mail to the last known post office address, delivered in person or by delivering it to and leaving it in the possession of any person in charge of the premises, or in the case such person is not found upon the premises, by affixing a copy thereof, in a conspicuous place at the entrance door or avenue of access; and such procedure shall be deemed the equivalent of personal notice.

(2) If the notice of violation and order is not complied with within the time specified by the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal, and if no review of such order has been initiated under IC 36-8-17-10, the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal shall request the legal counsel of the city to institute the appropriate legal proceedings to restrain, correct or abate such violation or to require removal or termination of the unlawful use of the building or structure in violation of the provisions of this chapter or of any order or direction made pursuant thereto.

(3) When the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal determines there is actual and potential danger to the occupants or those in the proximity of any building, structure or premises because of unsafe structural conditions, or inadequacy of any means of egress, the presence of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors, or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, the Fire Chief may issue an emergency order for the immediate evacuation of the building, structure or premises. All of the occupants so notified shall immediately leave the building, structure or premises and persons shall not enter or reenter until authorized to do so by the Fire Chief. Any person who shall refuse to leave, interfere with the evacuation of other occupants or continue any operation after having been given an evacuation order except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be deemed in violation of this chapter.

(G) Certificate of Occupancy. All certificates of occupancy issued by the Building Commissioner, with the exception of one- and two-family dwellings, must contain the signature of the Fire Chief or Fire Marshal. [Ord. 829, 1992.

Article I. General Provisions


15.20.010 Statutory authorization.

The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the city of Angola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.001.]


15.20.020 Findings of fact.

(A) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(B) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.002.]


15.20.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

(A) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;

(D) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage;

(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and

(F) Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.003.]


15.20.040 Objectives.

The objectives of this chapter are:

(A) To protect human life and health;

(B) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(C) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(D) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(E) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;

(F) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and

(G) To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.004.]


15.20.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“A zone” means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as zone A, zone AE, zones A1 through A30, zone AO, zone AH, zone AR, and zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:

(1) Zone A. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(2) Zones AE and A1 through A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of zones A1 through A30.)

(3) Zone AO. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(4) Zone AH. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(5) Zone AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(6) Zone A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

“Accessory structure” (“appurtenant structure”) means a structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and must be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.

“Addition” (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

“Base flood elevation” (“BFE”) means the elevation of the one percent annual chance flood.

“Basement” means that portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

Building. See “Structure.”

“Community” means a political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.

“Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include but are not limited to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

“Development” means:

(1) Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to:

(a) Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure;

(b) Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home, or installing recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days;

(c) Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects;

(d) Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements, and the like;

(e) Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations;

(f) Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;

(g) Storage of materials; or

(h) Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.

(2) “Development” does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities, such as painting; reroofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.

“Elevated structure” means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers).

“Elevation certificate” means a certified statement that verifies a structure’s elevation information.

“Emergency program” means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM.

“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures, or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

“Existing construction” means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“Five-hundred-year flood” (“500-year flood”) means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year.

“Flood” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.

“Flood boundary and floodway map” (“FBFM”) means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.

“Flood hazard boundary map” (“FHBM”) means an official map of a community, issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been identified as zone A.

“Flood insurance rate map” (“FIRM”) means an official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood insurance study” (“FIS”) means the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Flood prone area” means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. See “Flood.”

“Flood protection grade” (“FPG”) means the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See “Freeboard.”)

“Floodplain” means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been, or hereafter may be, covered by the regulatory flood. The “floodplain” includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as “floodplain regulations,” “floodplain ordinance,” “flood damage prevention ordinance,” and “floodplain management requirements.”

“Floodproofing” (“dry floodproofing”) means a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces.

“Floodproofing certificate” means a form used to certify compliance for nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream.

“Freeboard” means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.

“Fringe” means those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.

“Functionally dependent facility” means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

“Hardship,” as related to variances of this chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Common Council of the city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state Register of Historic Sites and Structures.

“Increased cost of compliance” (“ICC”) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.

“Letter of map amendment” (“LOMA”) means an amendment to the currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.

“Letter of map revision” (“LOMR”) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.

“Letter of map revision based on fill” (“LOMR-F”) means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.

“Lowest adjacent grade” means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest of the following:

(1) The top of the lowest level of the structure;

(2) The top of the basement floor;

(3) The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure;

(4) The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars;

(5) The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters unless:

(a) The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters, by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls having a total net area of one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and

(b) Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Map amendment” means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (that is, no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).

“Map panel number” means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA. The letter “B” is the first revision.)

“Market value” means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.

“Mitigation” means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.

“National Flood Insurance Program” (“NFIP”) means the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry.

“National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929” means, as corrected in 1929, a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

“New construction” means any structure for which the start of construction commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.

“North American Vertical Datum of 1988” (“NAVD 88”) means, as adopted in 1993, a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

“Obstruction” includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or, due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One-hundred-year flood” (“100-year flood”) means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter “A” is subject to the one percent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory flood.”

“One percent annual chance flood” means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter “A” is subject to the one percent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory flood.”

“Participating community” means any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.

“Physical map revision” (“PMR”) means an official republication of a community’s FEMA map to effect changes to base (one percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.

“Post-FIRM construction” means construction or substantial improvement that started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.

“Pre-FIRM construction” means construction or substantial improvement which started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later.

“Probation” means a means of formally notifying participating communities of violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations.

“Public safety and nuisance” means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

(1) Built on a single chassis;

(2) Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;

(3) Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

(4) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regular program” means the phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.

“Regulatory flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the state Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in AMC 15.20.070. The regulatory flood is also known by the terms “base flood,” “one percent annual chance flood,” and “100-year flood.”

“Repetitive loss” means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event.

“Section 1316” means the section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.

“Special flood hazard area” (“SFHA”) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city generally identified as such on the Steuben County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated December 17, 2013, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Steuben County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city are generally identified as such on the Steuben County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated December 17, 2013, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AE, A1 through A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued; provided, that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement or permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footing, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation for placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.

“Suspension” means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel, or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. “Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

“X zone” means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.

“Zone” means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

Zone A. See “A zone.”

“Zone B, C, and X” means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of zones B and C.) [Ord. 1452-2013; Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.005.]

(A) This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the state Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.

(B) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city shall be as delineated on the one percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Steuben County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas, dated December 17, 2013, and the corresponding flood insurance rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated December 17, 2013, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.

(C) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city, delineated as an A zone on the Steuben County, Indiana, and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated December 17, 2013, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date shall be according to the best data available as provided by the state Department of Natural Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.

(D) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the state Department of Natural Resources; provided, that the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater that one square mile. [Ord. 1452-2013; Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.007.]


15.20.080 Establishment of floodplain development permits.

A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.008.]


15.20.090 Compliance.

No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.009.]


15.20.100 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.010.]


15.20.110 Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.

(A) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.

(B) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.

(C) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.011.]


15.20.120 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:

(A) Considered as minimum requirements;

(B) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(C) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.012.]


15.20.130 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the state of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.013.]


15.20.140 Increased cost of compliance (ICC).

In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a repetitive loss structure, the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.014.]

(B) Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection (D) of this section.

(C) Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (or manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection (D) of this section. Structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:

(1) A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the structure has been designed so that, below the FPG, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in AMC 15.20.170(B)(10).

(2) Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity.

(D) Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:

(1) Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area);

(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade);

(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions;

(4) Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall, excluding any device that may be inserted such as a typical foundation air vent device;

(5) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);

(7) The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation at or higher than the exterior grade;

(8) Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and

(9) Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structure’s originally approved design shall be presented as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.

(E) Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent landfill in accordance with the following:

(1) The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compacting to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the standard proctor test method.

(2) The fill should extend at least 10 feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG.

(3) The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulk heading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.

(4) The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.

(5) The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.

(F) Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following requirements:

(1) The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site:

(a) Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;

(b) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

(c) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

(d) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.

(2) The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood.

(3) Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in subsection (D) of this section. Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.

(4) Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:

(a) Be on site for less than 180 days; and

(b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or

(c) Meet the requirements for manufactured homes as stated earlier in this section. [Ord. 1457-2013; Ord. 1452-2013; Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.046.]


15.20.200 Standards for subdivision proposals.

(B) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

(C) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

(D) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.

(E) All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.

(F) All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of the SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders). [Ord. 1452-2013; Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.047.]


15.20.210 Critical facility.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.048.]


15.20.220 Standards for identified floodways.

(A) Located within SFHAs, established in AMC 15.20.070, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving and the like, undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a nonboundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of nonsubstantial additions/improvements to residences in a nonboundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)

(B) No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in AMC 15.20.180 through 15.20.250 have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.

(C) No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot.

(D) For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.049.]


15.20.230 Standards for identified fringe.

If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in AMC 15.20.180 through 15.20.250 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.050.]


15.20.240 Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringe.

(A) Drainage Area Upstream of the Site Is Greater Than One Square Mile.

(1) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.

(2) No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

(3) Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in AMC 15.20.180 through 15.20.250 have been met.

(B) Drainage Area Upstream of the Site Is Less Than One Square Mile.

(1) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site.

(2) Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in AMC 15.20.180 through 15.20.250 have been met.

(C) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.051.]


15.20.250 Standards for AO zones (when AO zones are identified).

Located within the SFHAs established in AMC 15.20.070 are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions shall apply.

(A) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet greater than the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade.

(B) Drainage paths must be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures to be constructed on slopes.

(C) All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:

(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet greater than the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent grade; or

(2) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as per AMC 15.20.190(C). [Ord. 1306-2009. Code 2000 § 151.052.]


15.20.260 Standards for flood prone areas.

All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per AMC 15.20.180 through 15.20.250. [Ord. 1457-2013. Code 2000 § 151.053.]

Purpose of historic preservation and protection: in order to promote the educational, cultural and general welfare of the citizens of Angola and to insure the harmonious and orderly growth and development of the municipality; to maintain established residential neighborhoods in danger of having their distinctiveness destroyed; to enhance property values and attract new residents; to ensure the viability of the traditional downtown area and to enhance tourism within the city of Angola; it is deemed essential by the city of Angola that qualities relating to its history and harmonious outward appearance of its structures be preserved. This purpose is advanced through the restoration and preservation of historic areas and buildings, the construction of compatible new buildings where appropriate, and the maintenance and insurance of compatibility in regards to style, form, proportion, texture, and material between historic buildings and those of contemporary design. It is the intention of the city of Angola through this chapter to preserve and protect historic and architecturally worthy buildings, structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods which impart a distinct aesthetic quality to the city and serve as visible reminders of its historic heritage. [Ord. 1247-2006. Code 2000 § 154.01.]


15.25.020 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

“Alteration” means a material or color change in the external architectural features of any building, structure, or site within a historic district.

“City” means the city of Angola, Indiana.

Classifications.

(1) Outstanding. The “O” classification means that the property has sufficient historic or architectural significance that is listed, or is eligible for individual listing, in the National Register of Historic Places. Outstanding resources can be of local, state, or national importance.

(2) Notable. A classification of “N” means that the property does not merit the outstanding rating, but it is still above average in its importance. A notable structure may be eligible for the national register.

(3) Contributing. A “C” classification means the property is at least 40 years old, but does not meet the criteria for an “O” or “N” classification. Such resources are important to the density or continuity of the area’s historic fabric. Contributing structures can be listed in the national register only as part of a historic district.

(4) Noncontributing. Property classified as “NC” is not included in an inventory unless it is located within the boundaries of a historic district. Such properties may be less than 50 years old, or they may be older structures that have been altered in such a way that they have lost their historic character, or they may be otherwise incompatible with their historic surroundings. These properties are not eligible for listing in the national register.

“Demolition” means the complete or substantial removal of any building, structure, or site located in a historic district.

“Historic district” means a single building, structure, object, or site or a concentration of buildings, structures, objects, spaces, or sites, the boundaries of which are described or delineated on a map approved in an ordinance adopted under this title.

“Primary area” means the principal area of historic and/or architectural significance within a historic district as delineated on the map establishing the boundaries of the historic district.

“Routine maintenance” means work for which no certificate of appropriateness is required.

“Secondary area” means an area in a historic district delineated on the map establishing the boundaries of the historic district that is adjacent to a primary area and which has a visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the preservation of the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent, primary area.

“Streetscape” means appearance from a public way, the distinguishing characteristics of which are created by the width of the street and sidewalks, their paving materials and color, the design of the street furniture (e.g., street lights, trash receptacles, benches, and the like), use of plant materials such as trees and shrubs, and the setback, mass, and proportion of those buildings which enclose the street.

15.25.090 Visual compatibility.

(A) For New Construction, Contemporary Design, and Nonhistoric Buildings. To preserve and encourage the integrity of historic buildings, structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods and to ensure their compatibility with any new work, the construction of a new building or structure, and the moving, reconstruction, alteration, color change, major maintenance, or repair conspicuously affecting the external appearance of any nonhistoric building, structure, or appurtenance within the primary area must be generally of a design, form, proportion, mass, configuration, building material, texture, color, and location on a lot compatible with other buildings in the historic district and with places to which it is visually related.

(B) Criteria for Considering Visual Compatibility within Historic Primary Areas. Within the primary area of a historic district, new buildings, structures, as well as buildings, structures, and appurtenances that are moved, reconstructed, materially altered, repaired, or changed in color, must be visually compatible with buildings and places to which they are visually related generally in terms of the following visual compatibility factors:

(1) Height. The height of proposed buildings must be visually compatible with adjacent buildings.

(2) Proportion of Building’s Front Façade. The relationship of the width of a building to the height of the front elevation must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(3) Proportion of Openings within the Facility. The relationship of the width of the windows to the height of windows in a building must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(4) Relationship of Solids to Voids in Front Façades. The relationship of solids to voids in the front façade of a building must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(5) Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings on Streets. The relationship of a building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(6) Rhythm of Entrances and Porch Projections. The relationship of entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(7) Relationship of Materials, Texture, and Color. The relationship of the materials, texture, and color of the façade of a building must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(8) Roof Shapes. The roof shape of a building must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related.

(9) Wall of Continuity. Appurtenances of a building or site, such as walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape masses, and building façades, must form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if necessary to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to which it is visually related.

(10) Scale of the Building. The size of a building and the building mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches, and balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related.

(11) Directional Expression of Front Elevation. A building must be visually compatible with buildings, squares, and places to which it is visually related in its directional character, including vertical character, horizontal character, or nondirectional character. [Ord. 1247-2006. Code 2000 § 154.24.]

(B) If the Commission denies the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of a building, structure, or site, a demolition permit may be issued by other agencies and a building, structure, or site may be demolished, but only after the property owner has demonstrated to the Commission that the historic building, structure, or site is incapable of earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser.

(C) Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed by the Commission, based on the Commission’s classification on the approved map, but not less than 60 days or more than one year.

15.25.120 Maintenance.

(A) Historic buildings, structures, and sites shall be maintained to meet the applicable requirements established under state statute for buildings generally so as to prevent the loss of historic material and the deterioration of important character defining details and features.

Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the ordinary repairs and maintenance of any building, structure, or site; provided, that such repairs or maintenance do not result in a conspicuous change in the design, form, proportion, mass, configuration, building material, texture, color, location, or external visual appearance of any structure, or part thereof. [Ord. 1247-2006. Code 2000 § 154.27.]


15.25.130 Relationship with zoning districts.

Code 2000 § 154.28.]


15.25.140 Paint colors.

“Zone, A” means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as zone A, zone AE, zones A1 through A30, zone AO, zone AH, zone AR and zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:

(1) Zone A. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(2) Zones AE and A1 through A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of zones A1 through A30.)

(3) Zone AO. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(4) Zone AH. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are from one to three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(5) Zone AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

(6) Zone A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zones A1 through A30. See “Zone, A.”

Zone A99. See “Zone, A.”

Zone AE. See “Zone, A.”

Zone AH. See “Zone, A.”

Zone AO. See “Zone, A.”

Zone AR. See “Zone, A.”

“Zone, B” means areas identified as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, structures in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of zones B and C.)

“Zone, C” means areas identified as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, structures in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of zones B and C.)

“Zone, floodplain” means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

“Zone, X” means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.

“Zoning Administrator” means the officer appointed by and/or delegated the responsibility for the administration of this title’s regulations by the Plan Commission. The term “Zoning Administrator” includes his/her authorized representatives.

“Zoning district” means areas within the city of Angola for which uniform zoning regulations governing use, height, area, size, intensity of use of structures and land, and open spaces about structures, are established by this title. Districts are drawn on the official zoning map.

“Zoning map amendment” means the process used to change the current zoning district to another zoning district.

18.12.050    Unlisted land uses.

18.12.060    Questionable land uses.


18.12.010 Establishment of standard zoning districts.

The standard zoning districts in this title stand alone and are not part of a hierarchy or pyramidal system of zoning. For example, what is permitted in the R2 zoning district is not necessarily permitted in the R3 zoning district. Only those uses and development standards which are expressly permitted and noted for each zoning district apply to that zoning district.

For the purpose of this title, the city of Angola has established the following zoning districts:

 

	District Code	District Name	District Purpose

	PR	Parks and Recreation	This district is established for parks, trails, open spaces, and recreational areas.

	AG	Agricultural	This district is established for the protection of agricultural operations including small-scale confined feeding operations and buildings associated with agricultural production. This district is intended primarily for areas within the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

	AC	Agricultural Commercial	This district is established for commercial and industrial uses directly related to agriculture that are compatible with rural and agricultural areas. This district is intended primarily for areas within the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

	ER	Estate Residential	This district is established for agricultural operations and single-family detached dwellings in a rural or country setting. This district is intended primarily for areas within the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

	R1	Low Density Single-Family Residential	This district is established for single-family detached dwellings in the form of medium to large sized homes on medium to large sized lots.

	R2	Medium Density Single-Family Residential	This district is established for single-family detached dwellings in the form of small to medium sized homes on medium sized lots.

	R3	High Density Single-Family Residential	This district is established for single-family detached dwellings in the form of small to medium sized homes on small to medium sized lots.

	R4	Multiple-Family Residential	This district is established for single-family attached dwellings in the form of duplexes and triplexes.

	R5	High Density Multiple-Family Residential	This district is established for high density multiple-family dwellings in the form of apartment and/or condominium complexes.

	TR	Traditional Residential	This district is established for single-family detached dwellings in the form of small to medium sized homes on small sized lots. This district is intended primarily for older, traditional-style, existing neighborhoods within the city of Angola.

	LR	Lake Residential	This district is established for single-family detached dwellings on lake front property.

	MH	Manufactured Home Residential	This district is established for lease lot developments (mobile or manufactured home parks) which typically lease dwelling sites for single-wide and/or double-wide manufactured homes.

	UV	University	This district is established to provide flexibility for various uses related to higher educational needs that are associated with a university.

	IS	Institutional	This district is established for various institutional uses including governmental, hospital, educational, and religious institutions.

	NC	Neighborhood Commercial	This district is established for existing commercial uses located adjacent to residential neighborhoods and that serve those neighborhoods.

	DC	Downtown Commercial	This district is established to accommodate the unique mix of retail, commercial, entertainment, governmental, and professional uses with upper floor residential uses that occur in a downtown setting. This district is intended primarily for the existing downtown area.

	C1	Small to Medium General Commercial	This district is established for a wide variety of retail, commercial, service, entertainment, and eating establishments that are small to medium in scale and low to medium intensity.

	C2	Medium to Large General Commercial	This district is established for a wide variety of retail, commercial, service, entertainment, and eating establishments that are medium to large in scale and medium to high intensity.

	HC	Highway Commercial	This district is established for retail, commercial, service, entertainment, and eating establishments located along an interstate or other main highway.

	I1	Low Intensity Industrial	This district is established for low intensity industrial uses, light manufacturing facilities, and business parks.

	I2	Moderate Intensity Industrial	This district is established for moderate intensity industrial uses and light manufacturing facilities.

	I3	High Intensity Industrial	This district is established for high intensity industrial uses and heavy manufacturing facilities.

	HI	High Impact	This district is established for specific uses that can have a particularly high impact on adjacent areas.

[Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.16.]


18.12.020 Establishment of overlay districts.

The overlay districts as noted below have been established to add additional and unique development standards which will help the city accomplish its goals. For the purpose of this title, the following overlay districts have been established for the purpose as stated:

 

	District Code	District Name	District Purpose

	WH-O	Wellhead Protection Overlay	This overlay district is established to protect the integrity and potability of the community’s public water supply and enhance water quality of streams.

	CG-O	Corridor and Gateway Overlay	This overlay district is established to promote rational, aesthetically pleasing, and cohesive development in areas along major arterial streets and gateways.

[Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.17.]


18.12.030 Establishment of planned development districts.

As provided for in this title, only the following standard zoning districts may be rezoned to a planned development: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, TR, LR, MH, IS, UV, C1, C2, HC, I1, I2, and I3. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.18.]


18.12.040 Zoning district land uses.

The chapter for each standard zoning district in Division II of this title, Zoning Districts, identifies land uses allowed in that district. Such land uses are of two kinds: permitted uses and special exception uses. Angola’s permitted and special exception uses for each district are noted in the “Permitted uses” and “Special exception uses” sections of each chapter. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.19.]


18.12.050 Unlisted land uses.

Any land use not listed in either the permitted use or special exception use section of a particular zoning district shall be prohibited in that particular zoning district. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.20.]


18.12.060 Questionable land uses.

Any land use not listed in either the permitted use or special exception use section of a particular zoning district, but that is similar or related to a use that is a permitted use or a special exception use in that zoning district, may be deemed permitted through a questionable land use interpretation by the Zoning Administrator. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.21.]

18.16.060    Damage, destruction, or loss.


18.16.010 Description.

The map labeled “Official Zoning Map” maintained by the Plan Commission is hereby incorporated as part of this title and is to function as the means to apply a zoning district to each parcel within the city’s jurisdiction. The zoning map shall be formally known as the “official zoning map,” and it may be cited and referred to as the “Angola zoning map” or the “zoning map.” [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(A).]


18.16.020 Location.

The official zoning map will be located in the Office of Economic Development and Planning and maintained by the Plan Commission. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(B).]


18.16.030 Zoning district boundaries.

(A) Standard Zoning Districts. The standard zoning district boundaries shall be shown on the official zoning map. The two-digit abbreviations for the standard zoning districts appearing in this title or a specific color noted on the map legend shall be used to identify the zoning districts on the map.

(B) Overlay Districts. The overlay district boundaries shown on the official zoning map shall be interpreted as follows:

(1) Labeling. An overlay district shall be noted on the official zoning map with a hatch or textured pattern and be noted as such on the map legend.

(2) Fully Covered. A lot that is fully covered (bounded) by an overlay district shall be interpreted to be subject to the overlay district standards found in Division III of this title, Overlay and Special Districts.

(3) Partially Covered. A lot that is partially covered (transected) by an overlay district shall be interpreted to be subject to the overlay district standards to the extent the lot area is covered by the overlay district.

(C) Standards. Zoning district boundaries on the official zoning map shall be interpreted as follows:

(1) Streets. Zoning district boundaries shown within or parallel to the lines of streets, easements, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the centerline of the affected street, easement or right-of-way.

(2) Section Lines. Zoning district boundaries indicated as following or being parallel to section or fractional sectional lines, platted lot lines or city corporation lines shall be construed as following or paralleling such lines.

(3) Water. Zoning district boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers or other moving bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines.

(4) Vacated. Whenever any street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by proper authority, the zoning districts adjoining each side of vacated areas shall be extended automatically to the center of the vacated area. All areas included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject to all regulations of the extended zoning districts. The following exception applies:

(a) In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining zoning district, or zoning district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all of the vacated area.

(D) Disputes. Any disputes as to the exact zoning district boundaries shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may refuse to make a determination when he/she cannot definitely determine the location of a zoning district boundary. The Board of Zoning Appeals may then interpret the location of the zoning district boundary with reference to the scale of the official zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this title. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(C).]


18.16.040 Regular revisions.

The official zoning map shall be formally revised by the Plan Commission as changes are made (i.e., rezonings, planned developments, annexations). During the time it takes for each revision to be made electronically, hand drawn lines and text on a printout of the previous official zoning map will be appropriate to note zoning district changes. Revisions may be made at any time to correct drafting errors, clerical errors, or omissions, in the map. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(D).]


18.16.050 Copies.

Print copies of the official zoning map may be distributed. Each copy of the official zoning map shall be accurate only to the date on which it was last modified. The date of the latest revision shall also be printed on copies of the official zoning map. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(E).]


18.16.060 Damage, destruction, or loss.

In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret, the Plan Commission may prepare a new map which shall depict the official zoning map as accurately as possible, and shall supersede the prior map upon approval by the Common Council. The new map shall not have the effect of amending the official zoning map. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 1.22(F).]

Areas shown on this plan that are designated as a “Private Street Easement” (PSE) shall be established in favor of the adjoining property owners that are hereby granted the right to enter the easement for purposes of accessing their lot. The easement prohibits the property owners or any other person from placing any obstruction within the easement. The easements are binding on all heirs, successors, and assigns to the property on which they are located. The adjoining property owners or the city may enforce the provisions of the easement. The easement shall only be modified or vacated in the manner stipulated in this Unified Development Ordinance.”

18.160.010 How to use this division.

This division contains development standards that are arranged by category. There are two ways to determine which development standards apply to a specific zoning district. They are:

(A) “Additional Development Standards” Sections. Refer to the chapters in Division II of this title, Zoning Districts, for a specific zoning district. In the “Additional development standards” section for that specific zoning district are listed section numbers that determine which development standards apply. Only the section numbers noted in the “Additional development standards” section apply to that zoning district.

Example: In Chapter 18.40 AMC, the section number “AMC 18.164.010” can be found under the “Additional development standards” section in the R1 district. Therefore, the development standards in the section labeled “AMC 18.164.010” (in Chapter 18.164 AMC) would apply to the R1 zoning district.

(B) District Abbreviations. Refer to the abbreviations used at the top of each development standard section in this division. Each development standard section begins with a section number and introductory sentence followed by zoning district abbreviations (e.g., R1 for the low density single-family residential district). These zoning district abbreviations note that the development standards written in that section apply to that zoning district.

Example: In Chapter 18.164 AMC, the R1 abbreviation can be found under the AMC 18.164.010 development standard section. Therefore the language in AMC 18.164.010 would apply to the R1 district.

(1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.

(2) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.

(3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city’s rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city’s interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the zoning jurisdiction of the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

(C) The following standards apply:

(1) Separation from Sensitive Uses. For purposes of this subsection, measurements shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest part of any structure, including signs and roof overhangs, used in conjunction with the sexually oriented business to the closest part of any parcel containing one of the following land uses. Sexually oriented businesses shall have the following separation requirements:

(a) Residential Districts. Sexually oriented businesses shall be separated from residential zoning districts by at least 1,000 feet.

(b) Public Gathering Places. Sexually oriented businesses shall be separated from elementary or secondary schools, publicly-owned playgrounds and libraries, religious institutions, and licensed day care centers and preschools by at least 1,000 feet.

(c) Residences. Sexually oriented businesses shall be separated from residences and dwelling units by at least 750 feet.

(2) Separation from Other Sexually Oriented Businesses. For purposes of this subsection, measurements shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest part of any structure, including signs and roof overhangs, used in conjunction with the sexually oriented business to the closest part of any structure containing another sexually oriented business. Sexually oriented businesses shall be separated from other sexually oriented businesses by at least 1,000 feet. [Ord. 1463-2014 § 1; Ord. 1425-2012 § 4; Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.66.]

(A) Cross-Reference: The approval process and criteria for special exceptions is in Chapter 18.192 AMC, Processes.

(B) Applicable Development Standards. The development standards assigned to each zoning district are considered appropriate for the permitted uses within that zoning district. However, the development standards may not be appropriate for all special exception uses within a zoning district. For instance, some institutional uses are allowed in residential zoning districts as special exceptions. In this case, residential development standards would not necessarily be applicable.

(1) Determining Appropriate Development Standards.

(a) The Zoning Administrator shall determine which development standards sections within Division VI of this title, Development Standards, shall apply to each special exception application. The development standards determined to apply shall be documented in the application and approval.

(b) If the special exception use is a permitted use within another zoning district, the development standards for that zoning district shall be used as a guideline. In situations where the special exception use is not a permitted use in any zoning district, the most stringent development standards may be assigned by the Zoning Administrator as appropriate.

Article I. General Provisions


18.168.010 Applicability and intent.

This floodplain standards chapter applies to the following zoning districts: PR, AG, AC, ER, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, TR, LR, MH, UV, IS, NC, DC, C1, C2, HC, I1, I2, I3, HI.

The intent of the floodplain standards is to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the zoning jurisdiction of the city by minimizing public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. The following standards apply. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33.]


18.168.020 Statutory authorization.

The Indiana Legislature has, in IC 36-7-4, Local Planning and Zoning, granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the city of Angola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(A)(1).]


18.168.030 Findings of fact.

(A) The flood hazard areas within the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(B) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(A)(2).]


18.168.040 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of the floodplain standards to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

(A) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or flood velocities.

(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.

(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

(D) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage.

(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(F) Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(A)(3).]

(5) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.

(6) Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structure’s originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.

(E) Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the following:

(1) The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compacting to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the standard Proctor test method.

(2) The fill should extend at least 10 feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the flood protection grade.

(3) The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.

(4) The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.

(5) The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the flood protection grade.

(F) Standards for Structures Constructed with a Crawlspace. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace located below the flood protection grade; provided, that all of the following conditions are met.

(1) The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

(2) Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of one opening on each wall having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more than one foot above grade.

(3) The interior grade of the crawl space must be at or above the base flood elevation.

(4) The interior height of the crawl space measured from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point.

(5) An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event.

(6) Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.

(7) Utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above the flood protection grade.

(G) Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following requirements:

(1) The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the flood protection grade and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site:

(a) Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision.

(b) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision.

(c) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision.

(d) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.

18.168.180 Critical facility.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the special flood hazard area if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the special flood hazard area shall have the lowest flood elevated to or above the flood protection grade at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances shall not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the flood protection grade shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(D)(3).]


18.168.190 Standards for identified floodways.

Located within special flood hazard areas established in AMC 18.168.070, Basis for establishing regulatory flood data, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential.

(A) If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1, a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial addition to an existing structure in a floodplain or improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of nonsubstantial addition to an existing structure in a floodplain or improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)

(B) The Floodplain Administrator shall take no action until a permit for construction in a floodway (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this article have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, the city’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.

(C) No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 feet; and

(D) For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees), the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(D)(4).]


18.168.200 Standards for identified fringe.

If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in this article have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the flood protection grade. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(D)(5).]


18.168.210 Standards for special flood hazard areas without established base flood elevation and/or floodways or fringes.

(A) Drainage Area Upstream of the Site Is Greater Than One Square Mile.

(1) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.

(2) The Floodplain Administrator shall take no action until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis or regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

(3) Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis or regulatory assessment from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.

(B) Drainage Area Upstream of the Site Is Less Than One Square Mile.

(1) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year flood elevation for the site.

(2) Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this article have been met.

(C) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 feet and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 5.33(D)(6).]

This sign standards section applies to the following zoning districts: PR, AG, AC, ER, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, TR, LR, MH, UV, IS, NC, DC, C1, C2, HC, I1, I2, I3, HI.

The intent of the sign standards is to accomplish the goals of the Angola Comprehensive Plan; to regulate time, place, and manner characteristics of signs; to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of signs; to provide businesses with appropriate identification; to create a consistent streetscape; to maintain and enhance the aesthetics of the city; to eliminate potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians resulting from sign location, excessive distraction and clutter; and to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of zoning jurisdiction of the city of Angola. The following standards apply:

(A) Freedom of Speech. Any permanent sign or standard temporary sign permitted by the sign standards may be used for freedom of speech purposes for any length of time.

(B) Permits.

(1) Improvement Location Permit. An improvement location permit shall be required for all signs located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or altered unless otherwise specified in this section.

(2) State Permit. All signs proposed to be located along a state-owned interstate or highway shall obtain the proper state sign permit or written authorization from the Indiana Department of Transportation prior to seeking an improvement location permit.

(3) Easement Holder Approval. All signs proposed to be located within an easement shall obtain written approval from the easement holder for the proposed sign prior to seeking an improvement location permit. For example, a sign proposed within a county legal drain easement shall obtain written approval from the County Drainage Board before applying for an improvement location permit.

(C) Cross-Reference.

(D) Exempt Items. The following items shall be exempt from the sign standards because they are not considered signs and/or are not considered a commercial message (freedom of speech). Therefore, these items are exempt from obtaining an improvement location permit as a sign.

(1) Flags. A flag, pennant, or insignia of any nation, state, city, or other political unit. However, when a flag, pennant, or insignia of any nation, state, city, or other political unit is used as an integral component of a commercial message, it shall comply with the sign standards for the applicable zoning district. (For example, an American flag integrated into a corporation’s brand or logo.)

(3) Addresses. Posting of a street address on a mailbox, building, or other prominent location to provide adequate property identification. However, when a street address is used as a commercial message or is disproportionately large, it shall comply with the sign standards for the applicable zoning district. (For example, the numbers in an address being illustrated with ladders and slides for a store selling children’s play sets, or a commercial property that brands itself by its address and wants its address displayed using numbers six feet tall.)

Posting of a public safety or private property message; provided, that no individual posting exceeds the maximum area permitted for a standard temporary sign in the applicable zoning district or four square feet, whichever is greater. (For example, “Beware of Dog,” “Private Property,” “No Trespassing,” “Gas Line,” “Weight Limit,” “Video Surveillance,” and “No Turnaround.”)

(5) Operational Limitations or Information.

(6) Required Postings. Messages required by a local agency, state agency, state law, federal agency, federal law, public utility or utility regulated by the government, provided the area of the message and height of posting be the minimum size required by the agency or law. (For example, a gas pipeline marker).

(7) Indoor Commercial Messages. Commercial messages displayed inside a building that cannot be viewed legibly by pedestrians or drivers outside the building. (For example, a commercial message on a scoreboard inside a gymnasium, a wall clock inside a restaurant with a product name and logo, or a large banner with an image of a product mounted on the wall of a retail store.)

(8) Minuscule Commercial Messages. Minuscule commercial messages displayed on or near a primary entrance provided that the area of each minuscule commercial message does not exceed 30 square inches and the cumulative area of all minuscule commercial messages does not exceed 240 square inches per primary entrance.

(9) Religious Symbols. Symbol associated with a religion. However, when a religious symbol is used as an integral component of a commercial message, it shall comply with the sign standards for the applicable zoning district.

Chapter 18.184 NONCONFORMANCES

Sections:

18.184.010    Intent.

18.184.020    Distinction between conforming, illegal nonconforming, and legal nonconforming.

18.184.030    Illegal nonconforming structures, uses, and lots.

18.184.040    Legal nonconforming structures.

18.184.050    Legal nonconforming lots.

18.184.060    Legal nonconforming use.


18.184.010 Intent.

As new zoning regulations are adopted or zoning map changes are made, lots, structures, and uses that were previously compliant with zoning regulations are sometimes made noncompliant. This chapter specifies the provisions that apply to these legal nonconforming (informally referred to as “grandfathered”) lots, structures, and uses. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.01.]


18.184.020 Distinction between conforming, illegal nonconforming, and legal nonconforming.

Each structure, use, and lot is either conforming or nonconforming. “Conforming” is used to describe a structure, use, or lot as being in full compliance with the current unified development ordinance. “Nonconforming” is used to describe a structure, use, or lot that is in violation of the current unified development ordinance. Nonconforming structures, uses, and lots are either illegal nonconforming or legal nonconforming. The following sections determine the nonconforming status of a structure, use, or lot:

(A) Illegal Nonconforming.

(1) Structure. A structure constructed in violation of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when the structure was constructed and which remains in violation of the current unified development ordinance is an illegal nonconforming structure.

(2) Use. A use that was in violation of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when the use was initiated and which remains in violation of the current unified development ordinance is an illegal nonconforming use. In addition, a use that was legally established and is not permitted under the current unified development ordinance, but has been abandoned or discontinued for a period of at least one year, is an illegal nonconforming use.

(3) Lot. A lot established in violation of the zoning or subdivision control ordinance that was in effect at the time of establishment and which remains in violation of the current unified development ordinance is an illegal nonconforming lot.

(B) Legal Nonconforming.

(1) Structure. A structure that does not meet one or more development standards of this title, but was legally established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure. Generally, a structure is rendered legal nonconforming by an amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change. However, a legal nonconformity may be a result of government use of eminent domain or right-of-way acquisition.

(2) Use. The use of a structure or land (or a structure and land in combination) that was legally established and has since been continuously operated, that is no longer permitted by this title in the zoning district in which it is located, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming use. Generally, a use is rendered legal nonconforming by an amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change.

(3) Lot. A lot that does not meet one or more lot standards of this title, but was legally established and recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming lot of record. Generally, a lot is rendered legal nonconforming by an amendment to the zoning regulations or a zoning map change. However, a legal nonconformity may be a result of government use of eminent domain or right-of-way acquisition. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.02.]


18.184.030 Illegal nonconforming structures, uses, and lots.

An illegal structure, use, or lot is subject to the enforcement procedures and penalties of this title as amended. The enforcement and penalties of the zoning ordinance in place at the time the violation occurred shall no longer be in effect. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.03.]


18.184.040 Legal nonconforming structures.

The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming structures, structures associated with legal nonconforming uses, and structures associated with legal nonconforming lots.

(A) Legal Nonconforming Building Provisions. The provisions for legal nonconforming buildings, a subcategory of structures, are as follows:

(1) Building Expansion. A legal nonconforming building shall be permitted to expand in area and height as long as the nonconformity is not increased and the expansion otherwise meets the current unified development ordinance. For example, if a building is in violation of the maximum height standard, it can be expanded in area as long as the new addition does not exceed the maximum height standard and is otherwise in compliance with the current unified development ordinance.

(2) Building Exterior Alteration. The exterior walls of a building shall not be moved except as provided in subsection (A)(1) of this section. Otherwise, the roof and exterior walls may be maintained, repaired, refaced, and modified, resulting in the original aesthetic character or an altered exterior character, as long as the building’s nonconformity is not increased and the alteration otherwise meets the current unified development ordinance.

(3) Building Interior Alteration. Ordinary repair and replacement of interior finishes, heating systems, fixtures, electrical systems, or plumbing systems; and interior wall modifications are not regulated by this title.

(4) Building Relocating. A legal nonconforming building may be relocated if, by moving the building, it decreases the legal nonconformity and the relocation otherwise meets the current unified development ordinance.

(B) Legal Nonconforming Structure Provisions. The provisions for legal nonconforming structures, excluding the subcategory of buildings, are as follows:

(1) Structure Alteration. A legal nonconforming structure shall be permitted to be altered in height, area, mass, and time as long as the nonconformity is not increased and the alteration otherwise meets the current unified development ordinance. For example, if a permanent sign is in violation of the maximum height standard, it can be altered as long as the alteration does not exceed the maximum height standard currently permitted and is otherwise in compliance with this title.

(2) Structure Relocating. A legal nonconforming structure may be relocated if, by moving the structure, it decreases the legal nonconformity and the relocation otherwise meets the current unified development ordinance.

(3) Conversion for Longevity. Converting a structural component of a legal nonconforming structure to a more permanent material in order to prolong legal nonconformity shall not be permitted. For example, a legal nonconforming permanent pole sign would not be permitted to replace its existing wood posts with metal posts even if dimensionally the same size.

(C) Loss of Legal Nonconforming Structure Status. The following provisions apply to all types of structures:

(1) Condemned Structures. If a structure, through lack of maintenance, is declared by an authorized official to be condemned due to its physical or unsafe condition, it shall lose its legal nonconforming status and become illegal nonconforming; unless the structure is restored or repaired within three months of the declaration. The Zoning Administrator may grant an appropriate extension of time if work was started within the initial three-month period and reasonable attempts are being made by the owner to remedy the condemnation.

(2) Removal of Permanent Structures. If a permanent structure is fully or significantly removed or razed (i.e., 80 percent or more of the structure), the remaining permanent structure shall lose its legal nonconforming status and become illegal nonconforming; unless by significantly removing or razing the permanent structure the remaining permanent structure is in compliance or more in compliance with the current unified development ordinance.

(3) Removal of Temporary Structures. If a temporary structure is removed (e.g., moved inside, taken off site, or replaced by a new temporary structure), the temporary structure shall lose its legal nonconforming status and become illegal nonconforming.

(4) Flood. If a structure is severely damaged from a flood, resulting in a loss of either 50 percent of its market value or 50 percent of its structure, all reconstruction shall be required to meet the current unified development ordinance. All other flood damaged structures shall be allowed to rebuild the structure that previously existed.

(5) Acts of God. If a structure is severely damaged from an act of God, excluding flooding, resulting in a loss of either 70 percent of its market value or 70 percent of its structure, all reconstruction shall be required to meet the current unified development ordinance. All other structures damaged by an act of God shall be allowed to rebuild the structure that previously existed.

(D) Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the maintenance or repair of a structure to keep it in a safe, aesthetic, and functional condition. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.04.]


18.184.050 Legal nonconforming lots.

The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming lots:

(A) Legal Nonconforming Lot Provisions. A legal nonconforming lot shall be permitted to be developed as long as the desired structure(s) and use(s) meets the current unified development ordinance. If the application of the current unified development ordinance renders the lot undevelopable (e.g., the current setbacks do not permit a developable building envelope), the owner shall request the city apply for reasonable variances from the Board of Zoning Appeals.

(B) Loss of Legal Nonconforming Lot Status.

(1) Combining Lots Results in Conformity. If a legal nonconforming lot is combined with an adjacent lot resulting in conformity with the current unified development ordinance, it shall lose its legal nonconforming status. Therefore, future division of the combined lot shall conform to the current unified development ordinance.

(2) Lots in Combination. If a legal nonconforming lot is owned by the same person as the adjacent lot, and the owner uses both lots in combination for a duration of more than five years, the legal nonconforming lot shall lose its legal nonconforming status; provided the two or more lots in combination would constitute a single conforming lot.

(3) Permanent Structure across Property Lines. If a legal nonconforming lot is owned by the same person as the adjacent lot, and the owner constructs a permanent structure across the property line, thus permanently using two lots in combination, the legal nonconforming lot shall lose its legal nonconforming status; provided the two lots in combination would constitute a single conforming lot. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.05.]


18.184.060 Legal nonconforming use.

The following provisions apply to legal nonconforming uses:

(A) Cross-Reference.

(1) Agricultural. With respect to agricultural legal nonconforming uses, nothing in this section shall be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with IC 36-7-4-616, Zoning ordinance; agricultural nonconforming use.

(B) Legal Nonconforming Use Provisions. The provisions for legal nonconforming uses are as follows:

(1) Utilizing Existing, Enlarged, New, or Relocated Buildings. A legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to occupy or use an existing building, enlarged existing building, newly constructed building, or relocated building, provided the building meets the current unified development ordinance.

(2) Utilizing Existing, Altered, New, or Relocated Structures. A legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to utilize an existing structure, altered existing structure, newly constructed structure, or relocated structure, provided the building meets the current unified development ordinance.

(3) Utilizing Land. Any legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to utilize its lot, or lots owned in combination upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, provided the utilization of land meets the current unified development ordinance.

(4) Increase in Nonconformity. No legal nonconforming use shall be permitted to increase its nonconformity. The size of operation, number of employees, increase to vehicular traffic and similar increases in size do not increase nonconformity of a use. For example, a five-acre legal nonconforming junkyard that expands its operations onto five more acres of land it previously owned does not qualify as an increase in nonconformity; it’s still a junkyard. However, if the same junkyard adds a compactor facility which previously did not exist, that would qualify as an increase in nonconformity.

(C) Loss of Legal Nonconforming Use Status.

(1) Abandonment of Use. If a legal nonconforming use is abandoned or is discontinued for six or more months, except when a government action impedes access to the premises, it shall lose its legal nonconforming status. Any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions of the current unified development ordinance.

(2) Change of Use. When a legal nonconforming use is changed, altered, or evolves to be in compliance or more in compliance with the current unified development ordinance, the legal nonconforming use status is lost or partially lost. The current use cannot revert back to the original legal nonconforming use or increments thereof. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 8.06.]

(a) Request Additional Information. During the process of rendering a decision, the Zoning Administrator may request additional information to be added to the site plan, application form, or attachments.

(b) Exercise Discretion. Some provisions within this title allow the Zoning Administrator to apply discretion to a decision. If such discretion is exercised, the Zoning Administrator shall describe the decision and cite the authority for that discretion.

(c) Interpret This Title. Because this title cannot address every possible unique situation, project features, or land use, the Zoning Administrator shall interpret the intent of this title when not specifically addressed.

(3) Render a Decision. The Zoning Administrator shall render a decision to deny or decision to approve based on the information submitted, project review, discretion exercised, and interpretations made.

(4) Issuing an Improvement Location Permit. If the proposed project complies with this title, the Zoning Administrator shall render a decision to approve, document the terms of the approval on the permit, and then issue an improvement location permit.

(5) Decision to Deny. If the proposed project does not comply with this title, the Zoning Administrator shall not issue an improvement location permit. The Zoning Administrator shall internally document the reasons for not issuing an improvement location permit and send that information to the applicant by email or U.S. mail, or by telephone. If an email is used to communicate denial, documentation that the email was received shall be included in the file. Similarly, if a phone call is used to communicate denial, documentation of the phone call shall be included in the file. If a proposed project does not comply with this title, the applicant may promptly revise the application, or may promptly pursue relief from this title.

Each department shall determine if the infrastructure improvements installed or proposed to be installed meet the city of Angola’s construction standards and if the improvements include adequate connection to existing and future systems. If applicable, each department shall also review applicable cost estimates for reasonableness. Each department shall return the comment sheet with any comments or concerns concerning the infrastructure or the project to the Zoning Administrator.

(F) Duration. An approved secondary plat and any conditions shall be recorded in the office of the Steuben County Recorder within six months of the date of approval or become null and void. [Ord. 1268-2008. UDO § 9.15.]
