All applications shall be signed by the owner or owners of the property, lessee, or other person having legal control of the property, certifying that the information in the application is complete and correct. If the person signing the application is not the owner or lessee of the property, then that person shall submit a letter of authorization from the owner or lessee.

4
to correct it. A copy of the notice shall be submitted to the City Council and the Fire Department and be maintained as a permanent record.
2.
When the above action does not result in the correction or abatement of the violation or nuisance condition, the City Manager, upon notice from the enforcement official, shall institute any and all actions and proceedings, either legal or equitable, including seeking injunctions of violations and the imposition of fines, that may be appropriate or necessary to enforce the provisions of this ordinance in the name of the City of Old Town. The City Manager is hereby authorized to enter into administrative consent agreements for the purpose of eliminating violations of this Ordinance and recovering fines without court action.
3.
Any person who installs, operates or maintains an outdoor wood boiler in the City of Old Town without a permit or in violation of this ordinance, shall be subject to such fines, penalties, actions and orders as are authorized by Section 1-8 of this Code of Ordinances, as the same may be amended from time to time. A fine or penalty may be imposed for each violation. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense with respect to each violation. In addition, such person shall pay to the City of Old Town all the City’s attorneys’ fees, court costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the City in any enforcement action undertaken to correct a violation of this Ordinance.
B.
Permit Suspension. The Code Enforcement Officer, Public Safety Director or designee may immediately suspend any permit issued pursuant to this chapter if the Code Enforcement Officer determines that an outdoor wood boiler is operated in violation of this chapter and such operations poses an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the City of Old Town. An outdoor wood boiler shall not be operated during the period in which the permit is suspended. A suspended permit shall be reinstated once the condition that gave rise to the suspension is remedied. Recurrence of a condition which previously resulted in suspension of a permit shall be considered a violation of this chapter and be subject to the penalties provided in Section 25-08(3) above.
C.
Appeals. An outdoor wood boiler owner may appeal, in writing, the denial of an application, the notice of violation from an enforcement official or an enforcement official’s suspension of a permit to the Old Town City Council. The Council shall consider such appeals in open session and may include, at its discretion, testimony by the property owner, testimony by the Public Safety Director or enforcement official, witnesses, and members of the general public. Any appeals upheld by the Council must find, at a minimum, that either the Old Town Fire Department or the enforcement official deviated from the conditions detailed in this chapter and state specifically what those deviations were as part of its decision. If the decision of the Fire Department or enforcement official is upheld, the suspension of the permit will continue until such time as the boiler is brought into compliance with this chapter or discontinued from use. During the appeal process, however, the outdoor wood boiler shall not be used in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood.

12. Non-conformance.
A. Purpose. It is the intent of this Ordinance to promote land use conformities, except that non-conforming conditions that existed before the effective date of this Ordinance or amendments thereto shall be allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 12. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to become more non-conforming.
B. General
(1) Transfer of Ownership. Non-conforming structures, lots, and uses may be transferred, and the new owner may continue the non-conforming use or continue to use the non-conforming structure or lot, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) Repair and Maintenance. This Ordinance allows, without a permit, the normal upkeep and maintenance of non-conforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations that do not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or structure, and such other changes in a non-conforming use or structure as federal, state, or local building and safety codes may require.
C. Non-conforming Structures
(1) Expansions. A non-conforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the structure, and is in accordance with subparagraphs (a), and (b) below.
(a) Legally existing non-conforming principal and accessory structures that do not meet the water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback requirements may be expanded or altered as follows, as long as all other applicable standards contained in this Ordinance are met.
i. Expansion of any portion of a structure within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement.
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09

ii. Expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer to the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland than the principal structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body or wetland setback requirement.
iii. For structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland, the maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those structures within that 75-foot distance is 1,000 square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a structure that is within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland is 20 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater.
iv. For structures located less than 100 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified as GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified as GPA, the maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those structures within that 100-foot distance is 1,500 square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a structure that is within 100 feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond is 25 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater, except that any portion of those structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland must meet the floor area and height limits of division (iii).
For the purposes of Section 12(C)(1)(a), a basement is not counted toward floor area.
(b) Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a non-conforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in Section 12(C)(2) Relocation, below. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure, it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
(1-A) Special expansion allowance. Existing principal and accessory structures that exceed the floor area or height limits set in Section 12(C)(1)(a)(iii) and Section 12(C)(1)(a)(iv) above, may not be expanded, except that the limits may be exceeded by not more than 500 square feet provided that all of the following requirements are met.
(a) The principal structure is set back at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland.
(b) A well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation as defined in Section 15(M)(2)(b), extends at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, in depth as measured from the normal high-water line or upland edge for the entire width of the property.
If a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation meeting the requirements of Section 15(M)(2)(b) is not present, the 500 square foot special expansion allowance may be permitted only in conjunction with a written plan, including a scaled site drawing, by Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09

the property owner, and approved by the Planning Board or its designee, to reestablish a buffer of trees, shrubs, and other ground cover within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the shoreline or tributary stream.
(c) Adjacent to great ponds classified GPA and rivers flowing to great ponds classified GPA, except for the allowable footpath, there exists complete natural ground cover, consisting of forest duff, shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line. Where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of native shrubs, and other woody and herbaceous vegetation in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater.
(d) A written plan by the property owner, including a scaled site drawing, is approved by the Planning Board and is developed, implemented, and maintained to address the following mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland zone.
(i) Unstabilized areas resulting in soil erosion must be mulched, seeded, or otherwise stabilized and maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands.
(ii) Roofs and associated drainage systems, driveways, parking areas, and other nonvegetated surfaces must be designed or modified, as necessary, to prevent concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a water body, tributary stream or wetland. Where possible, runoff must be directed through a vegetated area or infiltrated into the soil through the use of a dry well, stone apron, or similar device.
(1-B) Planting requirements. Any planting or revegetation required as a condition to the Special Expansion Allowance must be in accordance with a written plan drafted by a qualified professional, be implemented at the time of construction, and be designed to meet the rating scores and the ground cover requirements of Section 15(M)(2)(b) when the vegetation matures within the 50 foot strip. At a minimum, the plan must provide for the establishment of a well-distributed planting of saplings spaced so that there is at least one sapling per 80 square feet of newly established buffer. Planted saplings may be no less than three (3) feet tall for coniferous species and no less than six feet tall for deciduous species. The planting plan must include a mix of at least three native tree species found growing in adjacent areas, with no one species making up more than 50% of the number of saplings planted unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board or its designee, based on adjacent stand comparison. All aspects of the implemented plan must be maintained by the applicant and future owners.
(1-C) Filing and reporting requirements. Written plans required pursuant to Section
12(C)(1A)(d) must be filed with the registry of deeds of the county in which the property
is located. A copy of all permits issued pursuant to this section must be forwarded by the
municipality to the department within 14 days of the issuance of the permit
(2) Relocation. A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09
5
Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more non-conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:
(a)
Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
(b) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
(3) Reconstruction or Replacement. Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 12(C)(1) above, as determined by the non-conforming floor of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with Section 12(C)(2) above.
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09
6
Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value, or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of such damage, destruction, or removal.
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the Planning Board or its designee shall consider, in addition to the criteria in Section 12(C)(2) above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
(4) Change of Use of a Non-conforming Structure. The use of a non-conforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board, after receiving a written application, determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream, or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, and functionally water-dependent uses.
D. Non-conforming Uses
(1) Expansions. Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that non-conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Planning Board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in Section 12(C)(1)(a) above.
(2) Resumption Prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use except that the Planning Board may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year extension to that time period. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five (5) year period.
(3) Change of Use. An existing non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources than the former use, as determined by the Planning Board. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed in Section 12(C)(4) above.
E. Non-conforming Lots
(1) Non-conforming Lots: A non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width, road frontage and shore frontage can be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09
7
not involving lot area, lot width, road frontage or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Board of Appeals.
(2) Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
(3)
Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Built: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal structure the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements.
13. Establishment of Districts
A. Resource Protection Zone. The Resource Protection Zone includes areas in which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values. This zone shall include the following areas when they occur within the limits of the shoreland zone, except that areas which are currently developed, and areas which meet the criteria for the Commercial-Business-Shoreland, Highway Commercial-Shoreland, and Industry-Shoreland, Industry and Service-Shoreland and Landfill -Shoreland need not be included within the Resource Protection District. Section 111.11 of the Zoning Ordinance also applies to these areas.
(1) Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated "moderate" or "high" value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF&W or the Department as of December 31, 2008. For the purposes of this paragraph “wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers” shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the great pond or river during the period of normal high water. “Wetlands associated with great ponds or rivers” are considered to be part of that great pond or river
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09
8
(2) Floodplains along rivers and floodplains along artificially formed great ponds along rivers, defined by the one hundred-year floodplain as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
(3) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of twenty (20) percent or greater.
(4) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected to a water body during normal spring high water.
(5) Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting, or river bed movement.
(6) All land areas within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a stream, exclusive of those areas within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond, or river, or within two hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of a wetland. Where a stream and its associated shoreland area are located within two- hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the above water bodies or wetlands, that land area shall be regulated under the terms of the shoreland district associated with that water body or wetland.
B. Low-Density Residential-Shoreland. The Low-Density Residential-Shoreland Zone includes those areas primarily suitable for single-family residential development. It includes areas other than those in the Resource Protection Zone, or Stream Protection Zone. Other uses permitted in the zone are those which are harmonious with the traditional pattern of development in residential neighborhoods in Old Town. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the R-1 zone.
C. General Residence-Shoreland. The General Residence-Shoreland Zone encompasses most of the older residential neighborhoods located within the shoreland zone and are located within convenient reach of central business facilities, exclusive of the stream protection zone. The R-2S zones are expected to contain most of the multifamily or apartment type dwellings likely to be needed by the community, which are located in the shoreland zone. However, in harmony with the established neighborhoods, the predominate land use will probably continue to be single-family residences. Certain additional uses which meet the requirements of this ordinance may be permitted, which contribute to balanced neighborhoods and enhance the attractiveness of the community. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-2 zone.
D. Rural Residence and Farming-Shoreiand. Encompassing most of the developable area located in the shoreland zone which is outside of the urban center, this zone is intended for the kinds of uses which have traditionally predominated in rural New England: forestry and farming, farm residence, and a scattering of varied uses not inconsistent with a generally open, nonintensive pattern of land use. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-3 and R-3/A zones.
Approved by Old Town City Council 6-1-09

E. Seasonal Residence-Shoreland. This zone encompasses land bordering Pushaw Lake and Perch Pond and is designed to provide for the most appropriate use and future development of this land, and to preserve to the greatest extent possible the natural beauties and features of the land. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-4 zone.
F. Commercial-Business-Shoreland. The Commercial-Business-Shoreland zone is established to accommodate those retail, service, and office uses which are of city-wide significance. Within this area of concentrated activity and intensive development is the shoreland zone section of the central business district, offices of professional and nonprofessional persons offering a variety of specialized services, and important public facilities. New construction and any alteration of existing building or land use should be consistent with the objective to develop and maintain the central business district. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the C-1 zone.
G. Highway Commercial-Shoreland. The Highway Commercial-Shoreland zones, located outside the central business district along highways, are designed to provide appropriate locations for commercial uses which require a large amount of open space for sales or storage, or for maneuvering and parking of automobiles. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the C-3 zone.
H. Industrial-Shoreland. The purpose of the Industrial-Shoreland zone is to provide land which is conveniently located with respect to transportation and municipal services and where other conditions are favorable to the development of industry and which at the same time is located as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential and business uses. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the I-1 zone.
I. Industrial and Service-Shoreland The purpose of the I-2 zone is to provide land which is conveniently located to transportation facilities for business activities which require
extensive land area, but do not require close proximity to residential areas of the
community and to promote such land use in the community while at the same time
locating such activity as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential areas. The zone
is limited to the shoreland area of the I-2 zone.
There shall be no newly established Commercial-Business-Shoreland or Industrial-
Shoreland Zones, Industrial and Service Shoreland Districts or expansions in area of
such zones adjacent to Pushaw Lake or Perch Pond.
J. Landfill-Shoreland The purpose of the Landfill-Shoreland Zone is to provide an area
for the state-owned solid waste landfill and activities accessory to and compatible with a
solid waste landfill to occur in such a way that neither the solid waste landfill nor the
accessory uses unreasonably impact the surrounding neighborhood; to balance the
operational needs of the solid waste landfill with neighborhood concerns; and to reduce
the conflicts that often occur between a solid waste landfill and neighboring residential
areas. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the L-1 zone.
K. Stream Protection Zone. The Stream Protection District includes

(3) The lowest floor elevation or openings of all buildings and structures, including basements, shall be elevated at least one foot above the elevation of the 100 year flood, the flood of record, or in the absence of these, the flood as defined by soil types identified as recent floodplain soils.
- 16 -
(4)
The total footprint area of all structures, parking lots and other non-vegetated surfaces, within the shoreland zone shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the lot or a portion thereof, located within the shoreland zone, including land area previously developed, except in the Commercial-Business (C-1S) and Industrial (I-1S and I-2S) zones adjacent to rivers that do not flow to great ponds classified GPA, where lot coverage shall not exceed seventy (70) percent.
(5)
Retaining walls that are not necessary for erosion control shall meet the structure setback requirement, except for low retaining walls and associated fill provided all of the following conditions are met:
(a) The site has been previously altered and an effective vegetated buffer does not exist;
(b) The wall(s) is(are) at least 25 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland;
(c ) The site where the retaining wall will be constructed is legally existing lawn or is a site eroding from lack of naturally occurring vegetation, and which cannot be stabilized with vegetative plantings;
(d) The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, are no more than 24 inches;
(e) Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain on rivers, streams, wetlands, and tributary streams, as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils.
(f) The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof, and no further structural development will occur within the setback area, including patios and decks; and
(g) A vegetated buffer area is established within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland when a natural buffer area does not exist. The buffer area must meet the following characteristics:
(i)
The buffer must include shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation. Where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch;
(ii) Vegetation plantings must be in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater runoff;
(iii)
Only native species may be used to establish the buffer area;
(iv)
A minimum buffer width of 15 feet, horizontal distance, is required, measured perpendicularly to the normal high-water line or upland edge of a wetland;
(v)
A footpath not to exceed the standards in Section 15(M)(2)(a), may traverse the buffer;
- 17 -
(6) Notwithstanding the requirements stated above, stairways or similar structures may be allowed with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer, to provide shoreline access in areas of steep slopes or unstable soils provided: that the structure is limited to a maximum of four (4) feet in width; that the structure does not extend below or over the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland, (unless permitted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. section 480-C); and that the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable access alternative exists on the property.
C. Campgrounds. Campgrounds shall conform to the minimum requirements imposed under State licensing procedures and the following:
(1) Campgrounds shall contain a minimum of five thousand (5,000) square feet of land, not including roads and driveways, for each site. Land supporting wetland vegetation, and land below the normal high-water line of a water body shall not be included in calculating land area per site.
(2)
The areas intended for placement of a recreational vehicle, tent or shelter, and utility and service buildings shall be set back a minimum of one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.
D. Parking Areas
(1) Parking areas shall meet the shoreline and tributary stream setback requirements for structures for the district in which such areas are located. The setback requirement for parking areas serving public boat launching facilities in Zones other than the Commercial-Business (C-1S), Industrial (I-1S) and Industry and Service (I-2S) zones shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, from the shoreline or tributary stream if the Planning Board finds that no other reasonable alternative exists further from the shoreline or tributary stream.
(2) Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from flowing directly into a water body, tributary stream or wetland and where feasible, to retain all runoff on-site.
(3) In determining the appropriate size of proposed parking facilities, the following shall apply:
(a) Typical parking space: Approximately ten (10) feet wide and twenty (20) feet long, except that parking spaces for a vehicle and boat trailer shall be forty (40) feet long.
(b) Internal travel aisles: Approximately twenty (20) feet wide.
E. Roads and Driveways. The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or driveways and drainage systems, culverts and other related features.
(1) Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river that flows to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning Board. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the road and/or driveway setback requirement shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be
- 18 -
used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent the road and/or driveway setback shall be increased by ten (10) feet, horizontal distance, for each five (5) percent increase in slope above twenty (20) percent.
Section 15 (E)(1) does not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or driveways that provide access to permitted structures and facilities located nearer to the shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of Section 15(E)(1) except for that portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.
(2) Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right of way regardless of their setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland.
(3) New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection Zone except that the Planning Board may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to permitted uses within the Zone. A road or driveway may also be approved by the Planning Board in a Resource Protection Zone upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district. When a road or driveway is permitted in a Resource Protection Zone the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.
(4) Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained in Section 15(N).
(5) Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten (10) percent except for segments of less than two hundred (200) feet.
(6) In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least (50) feet plus two times the average slope, in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
(7) Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway, or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply:
(a) Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced along the road, or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:
Grade Spacing
(Percent) (Feet)
- 19 -
0-2 250
3-5 200-135
6-10 100-80
11-15 80-60
16-20 60-45
21 + 40
(b) Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the grade is ten (10) percent or less.
(c) On sections having slopes greater than ten (10) percent, ditch relief culverts shall be placed at approximately a thirty (30) degree angle downslope from a line perpendicular to the centerline of the road or driveway.
(d) Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with appropriate materials.
(8) Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water runoff control installations associated with roads and driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure effective functioning.
F. Signs. The following provisions shall govern the use of signs in the Resource Protection, Stream Protection, Low Density Residential Shoreland, General Residential Shoreland, Rural Residential and Farming Shoreland, and Seasonal Residential.
(1) Signs relating to goods and services sold on the premises shall be allowed, provided that such signs shall not exceed six (6) square feet in area and shall not exceed two (2) signs per premises. In the Rural Residence and Farming Shoreland Zone, however, such signs shall not exceed sixteen (16) square feet in area. Signs relating to goods or services not sold or rendered on the premises shall be prohibited.
(2) Name signs are allowed, provided such signs shall not exceed two (2) signs per premises, and shall not exceed twelve (12) square feet in the aggregate.
(3) Residential users may display a single sign not over three (3) square feet in area relating to the sale, rental, or lease of the premises.
(4) Signs relating to trespassing and hunting shall be allowed without restriction as to number provided that no such sign shall exceed two (2) square feet in area.
(5) Signs relating to public safety shall be allowed without restriction.
(6) No sign shall extend higher than twenty (20) feet above the ground.
(7) Signs may be illuminated only by shielded, non-flashing lights.
G. Storm Water Runoff
(1) All new construction and development shall be designed to minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural
- 20 -
runoff control features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded areas, shall be retained in order to reduce runoff and encourage infiltration of stormwaters.
(2) Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary to ensure proper functioning.
H. Septic Waste Disposal
(1) All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules, and the following: a) clearing or removal of woody vegetation necessary to site a new system and any associated fill extensions, shall not extend closer than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or the upland edge of a wetland and b) a holding tank is not allowed for a first-time residential use in the shoreland zone.
I. Essential Services
(1) Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited to existing public ways and existing service corridors.
(2)
The installation of essential services, other than road-side distribution lines, is not allowed in a Resource Protection or Stream Protection Zones, except to provide services to a permitted use within said Zones, or except where the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable alternative exists. Where allowed, such structures and facilities shall be located so as to minimize any adverse impacts on surrounding uses and resources, including visual impacts.
(3) Damaged or destroyed public utility transmission and distribution lines, towers and related equipment may be replaced or reconstructed without a permit.
J. Mineral Exploration and Extraction. Mineral exploration to determine the nature or extent of mineral resources shall be accomplished by hand sampling, test boring, or other methods which create minimal disturbance of less than one hundred (100) square feet of ground surface. A permit from the Code Enforcement Officer shall be required for mineral exploration which exceeds the above limitation. All excavations, including test pits and holes, shall be immediately capped, filled or secured by other equally effective measures to restore disturbed areas and to protect the public health and safety.
Mineral extraction may be permitted under the following conditions:
(1) A reclamation plan shall be filed with, and approved, by the Planning Board before a permit is granted. Such plan shall describe in detail procedures to be undertaken to fulfill the requirements of Section 15 (J)(3) below.
(2) No part of any extraction operation, including drainage and runoff control features, shall be permitted within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland. Extraction operations shall not be permitted within fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, of any property line without written permission of the owner of such adjacent property.
(3) Within twelve (12) months following the completion of extraction operations at any extraction site, which operations shall be deemed complete when less than one hundred (100)
- 21 -
cubic yards of materials are removed in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, ground levels and grades shall be established in accordance with the following:
(a) All debris, stumps, and similar material shall be removed for disposal in an approved location, or shall be buried on-site. Only materials generated on-site may be buried or covered on-site.
(b) The final graded slope shall be two and one-half to one (2 1/2:1) slope or flatter.
(c) Top soil or loam shall be retained to cover all disturbed land areas, which shall be reseeded and stabilized with vegetation native to the area. Additional topsoil or loam shall be obtained from off-site sources if necessary to complete the stabilization project.
(4) In keeping with the purposes of this Ordinance, the Planning Board may impose such conditions as are necessary to minimize the adverse impacts associated with mineral extraction operations on surrounding uses and resources.
K. Agriculture
(1) All spreading of manure shall be accomplished in conformance with the Manure Utilization Guidelines published by the Maine Department of Agriculture on November 1, 2001, and the Nutrient Management Law (7 M.R.S.A. sections 4201-4209).
(2)
Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, or within seventy-five (75) feet horizontal distance, of other water bodies, tributary streams, or wetlands. All manure storage areas within the shoreland zone must be constructed or modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or contaminated storm water.
(3) Agricultural activities involving tillage of soil greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet in surface area, within the shoreland zone shall require a Conservation Plan to be filed with the Planning Board. Non-conformance with the provisions of said plan shall be considered to be a violation of this Ordinance.
(4) There shall be no new tilling of soil within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA; within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from other water bodies; nor within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and wetlands. Operations in existence on the effective date of this ordinance and not in conformance with this provision may be maintained.
(5)
Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA; within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of other water bodies; nor within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and wetlands. Livestock grazing associated with ongoing farm activities, and which are not in conformance with the above setback provisions may continue, provided that such grazing is conducted in accordance with a Conservation Plan.
L. Timber Harvesting [will be repealed pursuant to Section 4B]
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, timber harvesting shall be limited to the following:
- 22 -
(a) Within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, timber harvesting may be conducted when the following conditions are met:
(1) The ground is frozen;
(2) There is no resultant soil disturbance;
(3) The removal of trees is accomplished using a cable or boom and there is no entry of tracked or wheeled vehicles into the 75-foot strip of land;
(4) There is no cutting of trees less than 6 inches in diameter; no more than 30% of the trees 6 inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 ½ feet above ground level, are cut in any 10-year period; and a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation remains; and
(5) A licensed professional forester has marked the trees to be harvested prior to a permit being issued by the municipality.
(b) Beyond the 75 foot strip referred to in Section 15(L)(1)(a) above, timber harvesting is permitted in accordance with paragraph 2 below except that in no case shall the average residual basal area of trees over 4 ½ inches in diameter at 4 1/2 feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square feet per acre.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section 15(L)(1) above, timber harvesting shall conform with the following provisions:
(a) Selective cutting of no more than forty (40) percent of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level on any lot in any ten (10) year period is permitted. In addition:
(i) Within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, there shall be no clearcut openings and a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation, including existing ground cover, shall be maintained.
(ii) At distances greater than one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and greater than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting operations shall not create single clearcut openings greater than ten-thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest canopy. Where such openings exceed five-thousand (5000) square feet they shall be at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, apart. Such clearcut openings shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal. Volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
(b) Timber harvesting operations exceeding the 40% limitation in Section 15(L)(2)(a) above, may be allowed by the planning board upon a clear showing, including a forest management plan signed by a Maine licensed professional forester, that such an exception is necessary for good forest management and will be carried out in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. The planning board shall notify the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection of each exception allowed, within fourteen (14) days of the planning board's decision.
- 23 -
(c) No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body. In all other areas slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends more than four (4) feet above the ground. Any debris that falls below the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary stream shall be removed.
(d) Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as travel routes except when:
(i) Surface waters are frozen; and
(ii) The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
(e) All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in areas with low banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock or similar hard surface which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
(f) Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary stream. Upon completion of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.
(g) Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, in width for slopes up to ten (10) percent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten (10) percent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty (20) feet, horizontal distance. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland, provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty five (25) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
M. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber Harvesting
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, except to remove safety hazards.
Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection Zone the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section M(1), above, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
(a) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
- 24 -
(b) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of Section 15(M)(2)(b) a "well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond classified GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1250 square feet) area as determined by the following rating system.
Diameter of Tree at 4-1/2 feet Above Points
Ground Level (inches)
2 to less than 4 in. 1
4 to less than 8 in. 2
8 to less than 12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees" is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area..
NOTE: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot x 50-foot plot contains four (4) trees between 2 and 4 inches in diameter, two trees between 4 and 8 inches in diameter, three trees between 8 and 12 inches in diameter, and two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4x1)+(2x2) + (3x4) + (2x8) = 36 points
Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees totaling 12 points (36- 24 =12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared openings are created.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
(i)
The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;
(ii)
Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;
(iii)
Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(iv)
Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by is Ordinance;
(v)
Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.
For the purposes of Section 15(M)(2)(b) “other natural vegetation” is defined as retaining existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and one half (4 ½) feet above ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until 5 saplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level may be removed in any ten (10) year period.
- 25 -
(c) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in Section 15(M) paragraphs (2) and (2)(a) above.
(d) Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is allowed.
(e) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.
Section 15(M)(2) does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.
(3) At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not more than forty (40) percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured 4 1/2 feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, 25% of the lot area within the shoreland zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously cleared. This provision shall not apply to the Commercial-Business Zone, Industrial Zone or Industrial and Service Zone.
(4) Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged, except as allowed by this Ordinance.
(5) Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of Section 15(M).
N. Erosion and Sedimentation Control
(1) All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall also require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. The plan shall be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and shall include, where applicable, provisions for:
(a) Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
(b) Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
(c) Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.
(2) In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
- 26 -
(3) Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.
(4) Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure. In addition:
(a) Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.
(b) Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.
(c) Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.
(5) Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from water flowing through them. Drainageways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water from a twenty five (25) year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with riprap.
O. Soils. All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement, improper drainage, and water pollution, whether during or after construction. Proposed uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial development and other similar intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation and be prepared by state-certified professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State Certified Geologists and other persons who have training and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum ground water elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropriate. The soils report shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil limitations where they exist.
P. Water Quality. No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the State any pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair designated uses or the water classification of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.
Q . Archaeological Site. Any proposed land use activity involving structural development or soil disturbance on or adjacent to sites listed on, or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the permitting authority, shall be submitted by the applicant to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission for review and comment, at least twenty (20) days prior to action being taken by the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall consider comments received from the Commission prior to rendering a decision on the application.

G. Appeals
- 29 -
(1) Powers and Duties of the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers:
(a) Administrative Appeals: To hear and decide administrative appeals, on a de novo basis where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Code Enforcement Officer in his or her review of and action on a permit application under this Ordinance. Any order, requirement, decision or determination made, or failure to act, in the enforcement of this ordinance is not appealable to the Board of Appeals.
(b) Variance Appeals: To authorize variances upon appeal, within the limitations set forth in this Ordinance.
(2) Variance Appeals. Variances may be granted only under the following conditions:
(a) Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements including, but not limited to, lot width, structure height, percent of lot coverage, and setback requirements.
(b) Variances shall not be granted for establishment of any uses otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance.
(c) The Board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
(i) The proposed structure or use would meet the provisions of Section 15 except for the specific provision which has created the non-conformity and from which relief is sought; and
(ii) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship. The term "undue hardship" shall mean:
a. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
b. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
c. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
d. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 16(H)(2)(c)(ii) above, the Board of Appeals may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. The term “structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling" shall include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
- 30 -
(e) The Board of Appeals shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to ensure conformance with the purposes and provisions of this Ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing so may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. The party receiving the variance shall comply with any conditions imposed.
(f) A copy of each variance request, including the application and all supporting information supplied by the applicant, shall be forwarded by the municipal officials to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to action by the Board of Appeals.

If a municipal reviewing authority requests technical assistance from the bureau, the bureau shall respond within 5 working days regarding its ability to provide assistance. If the bureau agrees to provide assistance, it shall make a finding and determination as to whether a rule violation has occurred. The bureau shall provide a written copy of its finding and determination to the municipal reviewing authority within 30 days of receipt of the municipal reviewing authority's request. If the bureau notifies a municipal reviewing authority that the bureau will not provide assistance, the municipal reviewing authority may require a subdivision applicant to provide a determination certified by a licensed forester.
For the purposes of this subsection, "liquidation harvesting" has the same meaning as in Title 12, section 8868, subsection 6 and "parcel" means a contiguous area within one municipality, township or plantation owned by one person or a group of persons in common or joint ownership.

e. In locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to scenic vistas, natural landscape features, topography, and natural drainage areas, in accordance with an overall plan for site development;
f. In locations that provide compatibility in terms of physical
size, visual impact, intensity of use, proximity to other structures, and density of development with other permitted uses within the land use district;
g. In locations such that diversity and originality in lot layout
and individual building, street, parking layout is encouraged.
h. So that individual lots, buildings, street and parking areas
shall be designed and situated to minimize alterations of the natural site, to avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site, to conserve energy and natural resources, and to relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and of buildings.

City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 2 7 June 1, 2009
A. Purpose. It is the intent of this Ordinance to promote land use conformities, except that non-conforming conditions that existed before the effective date of this Ordinance or amendments thereto shall be allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 12. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to become more non-conforming.
B. General
(1) Transfer of Ownership. Non-conforming structures, lots, and uses may be transferred, and the new owner may continue the non-conforming use or continue to use the non-conforming structure or lot, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.
(2) Repair and Maintenance. This Ordinance allows, without a permit, the normal upkeep and maintenance of non-conforming uses and structures including repairs or renovations that do not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or structure, and such other changes in a non-conforming use or structure as federal, state, or local building and safety codes may require.
C. Non-conforming Structures
(1) Expansions. A non-conforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the structure, and is in accordance with subparagraphs (a), and (b) below.
(a) Legally existing non-conforming principal and accessory structures that do not meet the water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback requirements may be expanded or altered as follows, as long as all other applicable standards contained in this Ordinance are met.
i. Expansion of any portion of a structure within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement.
ii. Expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer to the normal high- water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland than the principal structure is prohibited, even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body or wetland setback requirement.
iii. For structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland, the maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those structures within that 75-foot distance is 1,000 square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a structure that is within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland is 20 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 2 8 June 1, 2009
iv. For structures located less than 100 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified as GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified as GPA, the maximum combined total floor area for all portions of those structures within that 100-foot distance is 1,500 square feet, and the maximum height of any portion of a structure that is within 100 feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond is 25 feet or the height of the existing structure, whichever is greater, except that any portion of those structures located less than 75 feet, horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland must meet the floor area and height limits of division (iii).
For the purposes of Section 12(C)(1)(a), a basement is not counted toward floor area.
(b) Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a non- conforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Relocation, below. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure, it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
(1-A) Special expansion allowance. Existing principal and accessory structures that exceed the floor area or height limits set in Section 12(C)(1)(a)(iii) and Section 12(C)(1)(a)(iv) above, may not be expanded, except that the limits may be exceeded by not more than 500 square feet provided that all of the following requirements are met.
(a) The principal structure is set back at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland.
(b) A well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation as defined in Section 15(M)(2)(b), extends at least 50 feet, horizontal distance, in depth as measured from the normal high-water line or upland edge for the entire width of the property.
If a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation meeting the requirements of Section 15(M)(2)(b) is not present, the 500 square foot special expansion allowance may be permitted only in conjunction with a written plan, including a scaled site drawing, by the property owner, and approved by the Planning Board or its designee, to reestablish a buffer of trees, shrubs, and other ground cover within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the shoreline or tributary stream.
(c) Adjacent to great ponds classified GPA and rivers flowing to great ponds classified GPA, except for the allowable footpath, there exists complete natural ground cover, consisting of forest duff, shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation within 50 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line. Where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch and plantings of native shrubs, and other woody and herbaceous vegetation in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 2 9 June 1, 2009
(d) A written plan by the property owner, including a scaled site drawing, is approved by the Planning Board and is developed, implemented, and maintained to address the following mitigation measures for the property within the shoreland zone.
(i) Unstabilized areas resulting in soil erosion must be mulched, seeded, or otherwise stabilized and maintained to prevent further erosion and sedimentation to water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands.
(ii) Roofs and associated drainage systems, driveways, parking areas, and other nonvegetated surfaces must be designed or modified, as necessary, to prevent concentrated flow of storm water runoff from reaching a water body, tributary stream or wetland. Where possible, runoff must be directed through a vegetated area or infiltrated into the soil through the use of a dry well, stone apron, or similar device.
(1-B) Planting requirements. Any planting or revegetation required as a condition to the Special Expansion Allowance must be in accordance with a written plan drafted by a qualified professional, be implemented at the time of construction, and be designed to meet the rating scores and the ground cover requirements of Section 15(M)(2)(b) when the vegetation matures within the 50 foot strip. At a minimum, the plan must provide for the establishment of a well-distributed planting of saplings spaced so that there is at least one sapling per 80 square feet of newly established buffer. Planted saplings may be no less than three (3) feet tall for coniferous species and no less than six feet tall for deciduous species. The planting plan must include a mix of at least three native tree species found growing in adjacent areas, with no one species making up more than 50% of the number of saplings planted unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board or its designee, based on adjacent stand comparison. All aspects of the implemented plan must be maintained by the applicant and future owners.
(1-C) Filing and reporting requirements. Written plans required pursuant to Section
12(C)(1A)(d) must be filed with the registry of deeds of the county in which the property
is located. A copy of all permits issued pursuant to this section must be forwarded by the
municipality to the department within 14 days of the issuance of the permit
(2) Relocation. A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more non-conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Planning Board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Planning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 3 0 June 1, 2009
structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:
(a)
Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
(b) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
(3) Reconstruction or Replacement. Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 12(C)(1) above, as determined by the non-conforming floor of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with Section 12(C)(2) above.
Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value, or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of such damage, destruction, or removal.
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the Planning Board or its designee shall consider, in addition to the criteria in Section 12(C)(2) above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
(4) Change of Use of a Non-conforming Structure. The use of a non-conforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board, after receiving a written application,
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 3 1 June 1, 2009
determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream, or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, and functionally water-dependent uses.
D. Non-conforming Uses
(1) Expansions. Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that non-conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Planning Board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in Section 12(C)(1)(a) above.
(2) Resumption Prohibited. A lot, building or structure in or on which a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use except that the Planning Board may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year extension to that time period. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five (5) year period.
(3) Change of Use. An existing non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources than the former use, as determined by the Planning Board. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed in Section 12(C)(4) above.
E. Non-conforming Lots
(1) Non-conforming Lots: A non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width, road frontage and shore frontage can be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot width, road frontage or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Board of Appeals.
(2) Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 3 2 June 1, 2009
(3)
Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Built: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal structure the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements.
13. Establishment of Districts
A. Resource Protection Zone. The Resource Protection Zone includes areas in which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values. This zone shall include the following areas when they occur within the limits of the shoreland zone, except that areas which are currently developed, and areas which meet the criteria for the Commercial-Business-Shoreland, Highway Commercial-Shoreland, and Industry-Shoreland, Industry and Service-Shoreland and Landfill -Shoreland need not be included within the Resource Protection District. Section 111.11 of the Zoning Ordinance also applies to these areas.
(1) Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated "moderate" or "high" value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, including nesting and feeding areas, by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIF&W) that are depicted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) data layer maintained by either MDIF&W or the Department as of December 31, 2008. For the purposes of this paragraph “wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers” shall mean areas characterized by non-forested wetland vegetation and hydric soils that are contiguous with a great pond or river, and have a surface elevation at or below the water level of the great pond or river during the period of normal high water. “Wetlands associated with great ponds or rivers” are considered to be part of that great pond or river
(2) Floodplains along rivers and floodplains along artificially formed great ponds along rivers, defined by the one hundred-year floodplain as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
(3) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of twenty (20) percent or greater.
(4) Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected to a water body during normal spring high water.
(5) Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting, or river bed movement.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 3 3 June 1, 2009
(6) All land areas within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a stream, exclusive of those areas within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond, or river, or within two hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of a wetland. Where a stream and its associated shoreland area are located within two-hundred and fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the above water bodies or wetlands, that land area shall be regulated under the terms of the shoreland district associated with that water body or wetland.
B. Low-Density Residential-Shoreland. The Low-Density Residential-Shoreland Zone includes those areas primarily suitable for single-family residential development. It includes areas other than those in the Resource Protection Zone, or Stream Protection Zone. Other uses permitted in the zone are those which are harmonious with the traditional pattern of development in residential neighborhoods in Old Town. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the R-1 zone.
C. General Residence-Shoreland. The General Residence-Shoreland Zone encompasses most of the older residential neighborhoods located within the shoreland zone and are located within convenient reach of central business facilities, exclusive of the stream protection zone. The R-2S zones are expected to contain most of the multifamily or apartment type dwellings likely to be needed by the community, which are located in the shoreland zone. However, in harmony with the established neighborhoods, the predominate land use will probably continue to be single-family residences. Certain additional uses which meet the requirements of this ordinance may be permitted, which contribute to balanced neighborhoods and enhance the attractiveness of the community. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-2 zone.
D. Rural Residence and Farming-Shoreiand. Encompassing most of the developable area located in the shoreland zone which is outside of the urban center, this zone is intended for the kinds of uses which have traditionally predominated in rural New England: forestry and farming, farm residence, and a scattering of varied uses not inconsistent with a generally open, nonintensive pattern of land use. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-3 and R-3/A zones.
E. Seasonal Residence-Shoreland. This zone encompasses land bordering Pushaw Lake and Perch Pond and is designed to provide for the most appropriate use and future development of this land, and to preserve to the greatest extent possible the natural beauties and features of the land. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the R-4 zone.
F. Commercial-Business-Shoreland. The Commercial-Business-Shoreland zone is established to accommodate those retail, service, and office uses which are of city-wide significance. Within this area of concentrated activity and intensive development is the shoreland zone section of the central business district, offices of professional and nonprofessional persons offering a variety of specialized services, and important public facilities. New construction and any alteration of existing building or land use should be consistent with the objective to develop and maintain the central business district. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the C-1 zone.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 3 4 June 1, 2009
G. Highway Commercial-Shoreland. The Highway Commercial-Shoreland zones, located outside the central business district along highways, are designed to provide appropriate locations for commercial uses which require a large amount of open space for sales or storage, or for maneuvering and parking of automobiles. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the C-3 zone.
H. Industrial-Shoreland. The purpose of the Industrial-Shoreland zone is to provide land which is conveniently located with respect to transportation and municipal services and where other conditions are favorable to the development of industry and which at the same time is located as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential and business uses. This zone is limited to the shoreland areas of the I-1 zone.
I. Industrial and Service-Shoreland The purpose of the I-2 zone is to provide land which is conveniently located to transportation facilities for business activities which require
extensive land area, but do not require close proximity to residential areas of the
community and to promote such land use in the community while at the same time
locating such activity as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential areas. The zone
is limited to the shoreland area of the I-2 zone.
There shall be no newly established Commercial-Business-Shoreland or Industrial-
Shoreland Zones, Industrial and Service Shoreland Districts or expansions in area of
such zones adjacent to Pushaw Lake or Perch Pond.
J. Landfill-Shoreland The purpose of the Landfill-Shoreland Zone is to provide an area
for the state-owned solid waste landfill and activities accessory to and compatible with a
solid waste landfill to occur in such a way that neither the solid waste landfill nor the
accessory uses unreasonably impact the surrounding neighborhood; to balance the
operational needs of the solid waste landfill with neighborhood concerns; and to reduce
the conflicts that often occur between a solid waste landfill and neighboring residential
areas. This zone is limited to the shoreland area of the L-1 zone.
K. Stream Protection Zone. The Stream Protection District includes

(2) Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland and land beneath roads serving more than two (2) lots shall not be included toward calculating minimum lot area.
(3) Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was established by the owner of land on both sides thereof after September 22, 1971.
(4) The minimum width of any portion of any lot within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland shall be equal to or greater than the shore frontage requirement for a lot with the proposed use.
(5) If more than one residential dwelling unit, principal governmental, institutional, commercial or industrial structure or use, or combination thereof, is constructed or established on a single parcel, all dimensional requirements shall be met for each additional dwelling unit, principal structure, or use.
B. Principal and Accessory Structures
(1) All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great ponds classified GPA and rivers that flow to great ponds classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, except that in the Commercial-Business Shoreland, Industrial Shoreland and Industrial and Service Shoreland the setback from the normal high-water line shall be at least twenty five (25) feet, horizontal distance. In the Resource Protection Zone the setback requirement shall be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads, parking spaces or other regulated objects specifically allowed in that district in which case the setback requirements specified above shall apply. Expansion or replacement of existing nonconforming structures or replacement structures for nonconforming structures shall be governed by Section 12.C.
In addition:
(a) The water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback provision shall neither apply to structures which require direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls, nor to other functionally water-dependent uses.
(b) On a non-conforming lot of record on which only a residential structure exists, and it is not possible to place an accessory structure meeting the required water body, tributary stream or wetland setbacks, the code enforcement officer may issue a permit to place a single accessory structure, with no utilities, for the storage of yard tools and similar equipment. Such accessory structure shall not exceed eighty (80) square feet in area nor eight (8) feet in height, and shall be located as far from the shoreline or tributary stream as practical and shall meet all other applicable standards, including lot coverage and vegetation clearing limitations.

(d) The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, are no more than 24 inches;
(e) Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain on rivers, streams, wetlands, and tributary streams, as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils.
(f) The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof, and no further structural development will occur within the setback area, including patios and decks; and
(g) A vegetated buffer area is established within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland when a natural buffer area does not exist. The buffer area must meet the following characteristics:
(i)
The buffer must include shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation. Where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch;
(ii) Vegetation plantings must be in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater runoff;
(iii)
Only native species may be used to establish the buffer area;
(iv)
A minimum buffer width of 15 feet, horizontal distance, is required, measured perpendicularly to the normal high-water line or upland edge of a wetland;
(v)
A footpath not to exceed the standards in Section 15(M)(2)(a), may traverse the buffer;
(6) Notwithstanding the requirements stated above, stairways or similar structures may be allowed with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer, to provide shoreline access in areas of steep slopes or unstable soils provided: that the structure is limited to a maximum of four (4) feet in width; that the structure does not extend below or over the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland, (unless permitted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. section 480-C); and that the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable access alternative exists on the property. City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 1 June 1, 2009
C. Campgrounds. Campgrounds shall conform to the minimum requirements imposed under State licensing procedures and the following:
(1) Campgrounds shall contain a minimum of five thousand (5,000) square feet of land, not including roads and driveways, for each site. Land supporting wetland vegetation, and land below the normal high-water line of a water body shall not be included in calculating land area per site.
(2)
The areas intended for placement of a recreational vehicle, tent or shelter, and utility and service buildings shall be set back a minimum of one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland.
D. Parking Areas
(1) Parking areas shall meet the shoreline and tributary stream setback requirements for structures for the district in which such areas are located. The setback requirement for parking areas serving public boat launching facilities in Zones other than the Commercial-Business (C-1S), Industrial (I-1S) and Industry and Service (I-2S) zones shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, from the shoreline or tributary stream if the Planning Board finds that no other reasonable alternative exists further from the shoreline or tributary stream.
(2) Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from flowing directly into a water body, tributary stream or wetland and where feasible, to retain all runoff on-site.
(3) In determining the appropriate size of proposed parking facilities, the following shall apply:
(a) Typical parking space: Approximately ten (10) feet wide and twenty (20) feet long, except that parking spaces for a vehicle and boat trailer shall be forty (40) feet long.
(b) Internal travel aisles: Approximately twenty (20) feet wide.
E. Roads and Driveways. The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or driveways and drainage systems, culverts and other related features.
(1) Roads and driveways shall be set back at least one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river that flows to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the Planning Board. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the road and/or driveway setback requirement shall be no less than fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent the road and/or driveway setback shall be increased by ten (10) feet, horizontal distance, for each five (5) percent increase in slope above twenty (20) percent.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 2 June 1, 2009
Section 15 (E)(1) does not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or driveways that provide access to permitted structures and facilities located nearer to the shoreline or tributary stream due to an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of Section 15(E)(1) except for that portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.
(2) Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right of way regardless of their setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland.
(3) New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection Zone except that the Planning Board may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to permitted uses within the Zone. A road or driveway may also be approved by the Planning Board in a Resource Protection Zone upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district. When a road or driveway is permitted in a Resource Protection Zone the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.
(4) Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained in Section 15(N).
(5) Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten (10) percent except for segments of less than two hundred (200) feet.
(6) In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least (50) feet plus two times the average slope, in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
(7) Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway, or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply:
(a) Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced along the road, or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:
Grade Spacing
(Percent) (Feet)
0-2 250
3-5 200-135
6-10 100-80
11-15 80-60
16-20 60-45
21 + 40
(b) Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the grade is ten (10) percent or less.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 3 June 1, 2009
(c) On sections having slopes greater than ten (10) percent, ditch relief culverts shall be placed at approximately a thirty (30) degree angle downslope from a line perpendicular to the centerline of the road or driveway.
(d) Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with appropriate materials.
(8) Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water runoff control installations associated with roads and driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to assure effective functioning.
F. Signs. The following provisions shall govern the use of signs in the Resource Protection, Stream Protection, Low Density Residential Shoreland, General Residential Shoreland, Rural Residential and Farming Shoreland, and Seasonal Residential.
(1) Signs relating to goods and services sold on the premises shall be allowed, provided that such signs shall not exceed six (6) square feet in area and shall not exceed two (2) signs per premises. In the Rural Residence and Farming Shoreland Zone, however, such signs shall not exceed sixteen (16) square feet in area. Signs relating to goods or services not sold or rendered on the premises shall be prohibited.
(2) Name signs are allowed, provided such signs shall not exceed two (2) signs per premises, and shall not exceed twelve (12) square feet in the aggregate.
(3) Residential users may display a single sign not over three (3) square feet in area relating to the sale, rental, or lease of the premises.
(4) Signs relating to trespassing and hunting shall be allowed without restriction as to number provided that no such sign shall exceed two (2) square feet in area.
(5) Signs relating to public safety shall be allowed without restriction.
(6) No sign shall extend higher than twenty (20) feet above the ground.
(7) Signs may be illuminated only by shielded, non-flashing lights.
G. Storm Water Runoff
(1) All new construction and development shall be designed to minimize storm water runoff from the site in excess of the natural predevelopment conditions. Where possible, existing natural runoff control features, such as berms, swales, terraces and wooded areas, shall be retained in order to reduce runoff and encourage infiltration of stormwaters.
(2) Storm water runoff control systems shall be maintained as necessary to ensure proper functioning.
H. Septic Waste Disposal
(1) All subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed in conformance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules, and the following: a) clearing or removal of woody vegetation necessary to site a new system and any associated fill extensions, shall not extend closer than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or the
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 4 June 1, 2009

Manure shall not be stored or stockpiled within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, or within seventy-five (75) feet horizontal distance, of other water bodies, tributary streams, or wetlands. All manure storage areas within the shoreland zone must be constructed or modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or contaminated storm water.
(3) Agricultural activities involving tillage of soil greater than forty thousand (40,000) square feet in surface area, within the shoreland zone shall require a Conservation Plan to be filed with the Planning Board. Non-conformance with the provisions of said plan shall be considered to be a violation of this Ordinance.
(4) There shall be no new tilling of soil within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA; within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from other water bodies; nor within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and wetlands. Operations in existence on the effective date of this ordinance and not in conformance with this provision may be maintained.
(5)
Newly established livestock grazing areas shall not be permitted within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA; within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of other water bodies; nor within twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, of tributary streams and wetlands. Livestock grazing associated with ongoing farm activities, and which are not in conformance with the above setback provisions may continue, provided that such grazing is conducted in accordance with a Conservation Plan.
L. Timber Harvesting [will be repealed pursuant to Section 4B]
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, timber harvesting shall be limited to the following:
(a) Within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, timber harvesting may be conducted when the following conditions are met:

(3) The removal of trees is accomplished using a cable or boom and there is no entry of tracked or wheeled vehicles into the 75-foot strip of land;
(4) There is no cutting of trees less than 6 inches in diameter; no more than 30% of the trees 6 inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 ½ feet above ground level, are cut in any 10-year period; and a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation remains; and
(5) A licensed professional forester has marked the trees to be harvested prior to a permit being issued by the municipality.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 6 June 1, 2009
(b) Beyond the 75 foot strip referred to in Section 15(L)(1)(a) above, timber harvesting is permitted in accordance with paragraph 2 below except that in no case shall the average residual basal area of trees over 4 ½ inches in diameter at 4 1/2 feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square feet per acre.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section 15(L)(1) above, timber harvesting shall conform with the following provisions:
(a) Selective cutting of no more than forty (40) percent of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level on any lot in any ten (10) year period is permitted. In addition:
(i) Within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, there shall be no clearcut openings and a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation, including existing ground cover, shall be maintained.
(ii) At distances greater than one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and greater than seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting operations shall not create single clearcut openings greater than ten-thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest canopy. Where such openings exceed five-thousand (5000) square feet they shall be at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, apart. Such clearcut openings shall be included in the calculation of total volume removal. Volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
(b) Timber harvesting operations exceeding the 40% limitation in Section 15(L)(2)(a) above, may be allowed by the planning board upon a clear showing, including a forest management plan signed by a Maine licensed professional forester, that such an exception is necessary for good forest management and will be carried out in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. The planning board shall notify the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection of each exception allowed, within fourteen (14) days of the planning board's decision.
(c) No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body. In all other areas slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends more than four (4) feet above the ground. Any debris that falls below the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary stream shall be removed.
(d) Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as travel routes except when:
(i) Surface waters are frozen; and
(ii) The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
(e) All crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in areas with low banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock or similar hard surface which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 7 June 1, 2009
(f) Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary stream. Upon completion of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.
(g) Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, in width for slopes up to ten (10) percent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten (10) percent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty (20) feet, horizontal distance. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland, provided, however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty five (25) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
M. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation for Activities Other Than Timber Harvesting
(1) In a Resource Protection Zone abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line, except to remove safety hazards.
Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection Zone the cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
(2) Except in areas as described in Section M(1), above, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
(a) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present) as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
(b) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of Section 15(M)(2)(b) a "well-distributed stand of trees" adjacent to a great pond classified GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA, shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1250 square feet) area as determined by the following rating system.
Diameter of Tree at 4-1/2 feet Above Points
Ground Level (inches)
2 to less than 4 in. 1
4 to less than 8 in. 2
8 to less than 12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well-distributed stand of trees" is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area..
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 8 June 1, 2009
NOTE: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot x 50-foot plot contains four (4) trees between 2 and 4 inches in diameter, two trees between 4 and 8 inches in diameter, three trees between 8 and 12 inches in diameter, and two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4x1)+(2x2) + (3x4) + (2x8) = 36 points
Thus, the 25-foot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees totaling 12 points (36- 24 =12) may be removed from the plot provided that no cleared openings are created.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
(i)
The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;
(ii)
Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;
(iii)
Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(iv)
Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by is Ordinance;
(v)
Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.
For the purposes of Section 15(M)(2)(b) “other natural vegetation” is defined as retaining existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four and one half (4 ½) feet above ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches in diameter can be removed until 5 saplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level may be removed in any ten (10) year period.
(c) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in Section 15(M) paragraphs (2) and (2)(a) above.
(d) Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is allowed.
(e) In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.
Section 15(M)(2) does not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the minimum area necessary.
(3) At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a great pond classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, there shall be allowed on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not more than forty City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 4 9 June 1, 2009
(40) percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured 4 1/2 feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, 25% of the lot area within the shoreland zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously cleared. This provision shall not apply to the Commercial-Business Zone, Industrial Zone or Industrial and Service Zone.
(4) Legally existing nonconforming cleared openings may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged, except as allowed by this Ordinance.
(5) Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of Section 15(M).
N. Erosion and Sedimentation Control
(1) All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall also require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. The plan shall be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and shall include, where applicable, provisions for:
(a) Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
(b) Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
(c) Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.
(2) In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
(3) Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.
(4) Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure. In addition:
(a) Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.
(b) Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.
(c) Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 5 0 June 1, 2009
(5) Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from water flowing through them. Drainageways shall be designed and constructed in order to carry water from a twenty five (25) year storm or greater, and shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with riprap.
O. Soils. All land uses shall be located on soils in or upon which the proposed uses or structures can be established or maintained without causing adverse environmental impacts, including severe erosion, mass soil movement, improper drainage, and water pollution, whether during or after construction. Proposed uses requiring subsurface waste disposal, and commercial or industrial development and other similar intensive land uses, shall require a soils report based on an on-site investigation and be prepared by state-certified professionals. Certified persons may include Maine Certified Soil Scientists, Maine Registered Professional Engineers, Maine State Certified Geologists and other persons who have training and experience in the recognition and evaluation of soil properties. The report shall be based upon the analysis of the characteristics of the soil and surrounding land and water areas, maximum ground water elevation, presence of ledge, drainage conditions, and other pertinent data which the evaluator deems appropriate. The soils report shall include recommendations for a proposed use to counteract soil limitations where they exist.
P. Water Quality. No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the State any pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair designated uses or the water classification of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.
Q . Archaeological Site. Any proposed land use activity involving structural development or soil disturbance on or adjacent to sites listed on, or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the permitting authority, shall be submitted by the applicant to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission for review and comment, at least twenty (20) days prior to action being taken by the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall consider comments received from the Commission prior to rendering a decision on the application.

G. Appeals
(1) Powers and Duties of the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers:
(a) Administrative Appeals: To hear and decide administrative appeals, on a de novo basis where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by, or failure to act by, the Code Enforcement Officer in his or her review of and action on a permit application under this Ordinance. Any order, requirement, decision or determination made, or failure to act, in the enforcement of this ordinance is not appealable to the Board of Appeals.
(b) Variance Appeals: To authorize variances upon appeal, within the limitations set forth in this Ordinance.
(2) Variance Appeals. Variances may be granted only under the following conditions:
(a) Variances may be granted only from dimensional requirements including, but not limited to, lot width, structure height, percent of lot coverage, and setback requirements.
(b) Variances shall not be granted for establishment of any uses otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 5 3 June 1, 2009
(c) The Board shall not grant a variance unless it finds that:
(i) The proposed structure or use would meet the provisions of Section 15 except for the specific provision which has created the non-conformity and from which relief is sought; and
(ii) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship. The term "undue hardship" shall mean:
a. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted;
b. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
c. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and
d. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 16(H)(2)(c)(ii) above, the Board of Appeals may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. The term “structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling" shall include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
(e) The Board of Appeals shall limit any variances granted as strictly as possible in order to ensure conformance with the purposes and provisions of this Ordinance to the greatest extent possible, and in doing so may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. The party receiving the variance shall comply with any conditions imposed.
(f) A copy of each variance request, including the application and all supporting information supplied by the applicant, shall be forwarded by the municipal officials to the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection at least twenty (20) days prior to action by the Board of Appeals. Any comments received from the Commissioner prior to the action by the Board of Appeals shall be made part of the record and shall be taken into consideration by the Board of Appeals.
(3) Administrative Appeals
When the Board of Appeals reviews a decision of the Code Enforcement Officer the Board of Appeals shall hold a “de novo” hearing. At this time the Board may receive and consider new evidence and testimony, be it oral or written. When acting in a “de novo” capacity the Board of Appeals shall hear and decide the matter afresh, undertaking its own independent analysis of evidence and the law, and reaching its own decision.
Appeals of the Planning Board will be made to Superior Court.

The Board of Appeals may grant a variance from the requirements of this Ordinance consistent with state law and the following criteria:
(1). Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(2). Variances shall be granted only upon:
a. a showing of good and sufficient cause; and,
b. a determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur, the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and,
c. a showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with other state, federal or local laws or ordinances; and,
d. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in "undue hardship," which in this sub-section means:
1. that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted; and,
2. that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood; and,
3. that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and,
4. that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
(3). Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and the Board of Appeals may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary.
(4). Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, or other development for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
a. other criteria of Section (I) and Section (F)(11). are met; and,

City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 7 3 June 1, 2009
(5). Variances may be issued for the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of Historic Structures upon the determination that:
a. the development meets the criteria of Section (I), paragraphs (1). through (4). above; and,
b. the proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(6). Any applicant who meets the criteria of Section (I), paragraphs (1). through (6). shall be notified by the Board of Appeals in writing over the signature of the Chairman of the Board of Appeals that:
a. the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
b. such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and,
c. the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant's decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant may have against the municipality that are related to the use of land located in a floodplain.

7. Sewage Disposal Provisions
The development must be provided with a method of disposing of sewage which is in compliance with the State Plumbing Code.
a. All sanitary sewage from new or expanded uses must be discharged into a public sewage collection and treatment system when such facilities are currently available or can reasonably be made available at the lot line and have adequate capacity to handle the projected waste generation. Compliance with this section shall be by written approval of the Superintendent of Pollution Control Department.
b. If the public collection system is not at the lot line, but can be extended in the public right-of-way, the collection system must be
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 9 3 June 1, 2009
extended by the owner and the new or expanded use connected to the public system. Such extension shall be required if the public system is within one hundred (100) feet of a new use with a design sewage flow of less than five hundred (500) gallons per day or within three hundred (300) feet of a new use with a design sewage flow of five hundred (500) or more gallons per day and the system has adequate capacity to accommodate the additional flow. The Planning Board may waive this requirement if the use is already served by a properly functioning subsurface disposal system that is properly sized for the projected flows, provided that connection to the public system must occur if and when the subsurface system needs to be replaced.
c. If the public system cannot serve or be extended to serve a new or expanded use, the sewage must be disposed of by an on-site sewage disposal system meeting the requirements of the Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules.
d. When two (2) or more lots or buildings in different ownership share the use of a common subsurface disposal system, the system must be owned and maintained in common by an owners' association. Covenants in the deeds for each lot must require mandatory membership in the association and provide for adequate funding of the association to assure proper maintenance of the system.
e. Industrial or commercial wastewater may be discharged to public sewers in such quantities and/or of such quality as to be compatible with sewage treatment operations. Such wastes may require pretreatment at the industrial or commercial site in order to render them amenable to public treatment processes. Pretreatment includes, but is not limited to, screening, grinding, sedimentation, pH adjustment, surface skimming, chemical oxidation and reduction and dilution. The pretreatment standards shall be determined by the Old Town Pollution Control Authority.
8. Utilities
The development must be provided with electrical, telephone, and telecommunication service adequate to meet the anticipated use of the project. New utility lines and facilities must be screened from view to the extent feasible. If the service in the street or on adjoining lots is underground, the new service must be placed underground.

The action of the code enforcement officer may be modified or reversed by the board of appeals by majority vote.
(b) Variance appeals: Except as provided in subsections (c), (d) and (e), the board is authorized to grant a variance only when strict application of
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 1 0 8 June 1, 2009
this ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause undue hardship. The term "undue hardship," as used in this ordinance, means:
(1) The land in question can not yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted; and
(2) The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions of the neighborhood; and
(3) That the granting of the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other properties in the same zone and would not be injurious to the neighborhood or contrary to the intent of this ordinance; and
(4) That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
(c) Disability variance. In accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A § 4353 (4-A), the board may grant a variance to an owner of a dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection only to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to, or egress from, the dwelling from [of] the person with the disability. The board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. For purposes of this ordinance, a disability has the same meaning as a physical or mental handicap under 5 M.R.S.A. § 4553, and the term "structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling" is defined to include railing, wall, or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
(d) Yard variance for single-family dwellings. The board is authorized to grant a yard variance for a single-family dwelling. The granting of a variance under this section from a yard requirement is only authorized when strict application of the zoning ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause undue hardship. The term "undue hardship," as used in this subsection, means:
(1) The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
(2) The granting of a variance will not alter the essential nature of the locality;
(3) The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
(4) The granting of a variance will not substantially reduce or impair use of abutting properties; and
(5) The granting of variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience, and no other feasible alternative is available.
The variance under this subsection may only be granted for a single-family dwelling that is the primary year-round residence of the petitioner. A variance under this provision may not exceed twenty (20) percent of a yard requirement and may not be granted if the variance would cause the area of the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage. The board is further authorized to grant a variance under this section to exceed twenty (20) percent of a yard requirement except for minimum yards on a wetland or water body requirement within shoreland zones by rules adopted pursuant to 38 M.R.S.A. § 435 et seq. if the
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 1 0 9 June 1, 2009
petitioner has obtained the written consent of a non-affecting abutting land owner.
(e) Variance from dimensional standards. In accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4353 (4-C), the board is authorized for one-family or single-family dwellings only, as defined in this ordinance, to grant a variance from the dimensional standards of the zoning ordinance when strict application to the ordinance by the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause a practical difficulty and when the following conditions exist:
(1) The need for a variance is due to unique circumstances of the property and not the general condition of the neighborhood;
(2) The granting of a variance will not produce undesirable changes in the character of the neighborhood and will not unreasonably detrimentally affect the use or marketability of abutting properties;
(3) The practical difficulty is not the result of action taken by the petitioner or a prior owner;
(4) No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to the petitioner;
(5) The granting of a variance will not unreasonably adversely affect the natural environment; and
(6) The property is not located in whole or in part within shoreland areas as described in 38 M.R.S.A. § 435.
As used in this section, "dimensional standards" means and is limited to ordinance provisions relating to lot area, lot coverage, frontage, and yard requirements. As used in this ordinance, "practical difficulty means the strict application of the ordinance to the property precludes the ability of a petitioner to pursue a use permitted in the zone in which the property is located and results in significant economic injury to the petitioner.
(f) Additional appeals. In addition to the authority granted to the board of appeals by virtue of the foregoing provisions, the board shall hear and decide appeals in accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 2691(4) concerning any matter for which the board has been granted jurisdiction under any ordinance of the City of Old Town.

112.07. Waiver of provisions.
Any facility owner/generator may seek a waiver to the provisions governing the establishment, alteration, operation or closing of the waste facilities subject to this section by using the procedures described below. It is the responsibility of the owner/generator to demonstrate that its proposal will comply with the intent of these rules.
Note: The planning board intends, through this section of "Waivers" to allow for flexibility and creativity in meeting the requirements of these rules. Differences in waste characteristics, facility size, geologic conditions and management capacities may be taken into consideration.
(a) Waivers affecting location, facility design, and construction. The planning board has determined that the requirements of these rules affecting location criteria for new waste facilities are best able to ensure that a facility will not pollute any waters of the state, contaminate the ambient air, constitute a
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 1 4 6 June 1, 2009
hazard to health or welfare, or create a nuisance. Whenever a facility owner/generator seeks to vary from the requirements of these rules relating to location criteria, facility design and construction, the owner/generator must present clear and convincing evidence that the facility site's location, design or construction is distinctive in some way that allows for compliance with the intent of the ordinances of the City of Old Town.
Application or plans that vary from the requirements of these rules shall identify the provisions from which literal compliance is sought, the proposed alternative, and such clear and convincing evidence as is necessary to demonstrate affirmatively that the intent of the ordinances will be met. The planning board shall consider the waiver as part of its comprehensive review of a complete application.
(b) Variances affecting the contents of the application and the facility closure plan. Specific requirements of this ordinance relating to the contents of an application for review under this section or the contents of a waste facility closure plan may be varied with the approval of the planning board. Particular waste characteristics, handling, site conditions and engineering designs may necessitate a greater or lesser need for data acquisition as determined by the planning board.
(c) Waivers affecting operation. Whenever any facility owner/generator seeks to vary any aspect of a facility's operation from the operating requirements of this ordinance, application may be made to the planning board for a special condition to the approval.
(1) Criteria. The planning board may grant a waiver only when it finds that a facility will not contaminate any waters of the state, contaminate the ambient air, constitute a hazard to health and welfare, or create a nuisance, and, specifically, that compliance with the intent of the ordinance is affirmatively demonstrated.
(2) Contents of application. Requests for a waiver properly submitted to the planning board shall include, but not be limited to:
a. Identification of the specific provisions of these ordinances from which waiver is sought;
b. The alternative operational procedure proposed and the reasons why it meets the intent of the ordinance;
c. The reasons for which a waiver is requested, including the environmental, economic and technological justifications; and
d. Any other relevant information the planning board may request or the applicant may wish to provide.
(3) Term and renewal of conditions. The term of the waiver shall be concurrent with the term of the approval or for such lesser term as the planning board may specify.
(d) Three-hundred-foot waiver. If the planning board shall determine from an examination of soil conditions, ground water characteristics, climatic conditions, topography, the nature and amount of the solid waste and other appropriate factor, that the deposit of solid waste within an area less than three hundred (300) feet from any classified body of surface water, will not result in an unlicensed direct or indirect discharge of pollutants to such body of surface water, it may, after notice and hearing, permit the deposit of solid waste within such area, upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. Permits issued pursuant to this section shall be for a term of not more than two (2) years but maybe renewed for successive two (2) year terms after re-examination pursuant to this section.
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 1 4 7 June 1, 2009
City of Old Town – Zoning Ordinance 1 4 8 June 1, 2009
(e) Prohibitions. The planning board shall not grant a waiver for a new or expended solid waste disposal facility when that facility:
(1) Overlies a significant sand and gravel aquifer as that term is defined in 38 M.R.S.A. Section 1310-N (2-A) (A); or
(2) When the proposed facility poses an unreasonable threat to the quality of a significant sand and gravel aquifer which it does not overlie; or
(3) When the proposed facility poses an unreasonable threat to the quality of an underlying fractured bedrock aquifer as that term is defined in 38 M.R.S.A. Section 1310-N (2-A) (B).
112.08. Appeal procedure.
Any appeal of a planning board decision under this section must be made in writing to Superior Court, pursuant to Rule 80B of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedures within thirty (30) days of the applicant's receipt of the planning board decision.
112.09. Violations and fines.
Violation of the planning board approval including conditions imposed by section 112.06 shall be declared unlawful. The violation of any such provision shall be punishable pursuant to Title 30-A, Section 4452(3) M.R.S.A., as amended from time to time. Each day the violation continues constitutes a separate violation. Furthermore, the Judge shall order that the violator or owner will pay the entire cost of abating the violation including legal costs incurred by the city of Old Town to obtain enforcement.
112.10. Severability.
The provisions of this ordinance shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision, or the application thereof shall be held invalid, the remainder of this ordinance and the application thereof shall not be affected thereby.
