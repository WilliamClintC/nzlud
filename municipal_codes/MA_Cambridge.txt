CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts

Beginning with Supp. No. 1, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation

PREFACE 
The Cambridge, Massachusetts Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1988, has been kept current by regular supplementation. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 1, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 2.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 2.12 of title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by "tens" (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 1, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1403, passed December 10, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, section 2.04.010 is section .010, in chapter 2.04 of title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992)) 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 1, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04)). If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 1, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 1, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. We prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

One or more Reviewing Commissioner(s) designated by the Chair of the Commission shall review and sign the final investigative report. Once signed by the Reviewing Commissioner(s), the report, the findings of fact and determination contained therein shall become the findings and determination of the Commission. 
F.  If the Executive Director determines after such investigations that probable cause does exist for crediting the allegations of the complaint or if the Commission so determines, notwithstanding a negative report from the Executive Director, the Commission shall forthwith endeavor by conference, conciliation and persuasion to eliminate the unlawful practice. The Commission and its staff shall not disclose what has occurred in the course of such endeavors except to disclose the terms of conciliation when the complaint has been disposed of in this manner. 
G.  In the case of failure to eliminate an alleged unlawful practice by the process of mediation or after ninety days have passed from commencement of mediation, or if probable cause exists that a conciliation agreement has been violated, the Commission shall issue and serve in its name a written notice, together with a copy of the complaint, requiring the person named in the complaint (hereinafter called the "respondent") to answer the charges of the complaint at a hearing of the Commission at a reasonable time and place specified in such notice.

2.76.160 - City discrimination policy. 
A.  Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals, because of race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife, hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society. Discrimination that deprives individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety, health and welfare of the City. 
B.  Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to safeguard the equal opportunities of all individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of City services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance and public accommodations. 
C.  Further, it is the policy of the City to encourage harmony and mutual respect among its inhabitants and visitors and to reduce tensions and strife caused by discrimination.

If requested either by the applicant for the demolition permit or by ten citizens not later than the date of such public meeting, or if at any time the Commission wishes to have the benefit of a public hearing, the Commission shall hold a public hearing prior to making the determination provided for in this section. If the Commission determines, after such a hearing if one has been held or without such hearing if no hearing has so been requested, that the demolition of the subject building would result in the demolition of a significant building whose loss would be detrimental to the historical or architectural heritage or resources of the City, such building shall be considered a preferably preserved significant building. The Commission may delegate to the Commission staff authority to determine without any hearing that a building is not a preferably preserved significant building and to so advise the Building Commissioner. Upon determination by the Commission or by the Commission staff that a building is not a preferably preserved significant building or upon failure by the Commission to make any determination within forty-five days of the date that a copy of the application was submitted to the Commission, the Building Commissioner may, subject to Section 2.78.130 of this article, grant the permit applied for. 
E.  Upon a determination by the Commission that any building which is the subject of an application is a preferably preserved significant building, it shall so advise the person who submitted the application and the Building Commissioner, and no demolition permit or building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises shall be issued until six months after the date of such determination by the Commission except as may be provided for in subsection I of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Building Commissioner may issue a demolition permit for a preferably preserved significant building at any time after receipt of written advice from the Commission to the effect either (1) that the Commission is satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood that either the owner or some other person or group willing to purchase the preferably preserved significant building would be willing to preserve, rehabilitate or restore such building, or (2) that the Commission is satisfied that for at least six months since the owner first sought the advice of the Commission or the Commission staff in locating a person or group that might be willing to purchase such building and to preserve, rehabilitate or restore the same, the owner of the preferably preserved significant building has made continuing, bona fide, reasonable and unsuccessful efforts to locate such a purchaser. 
F.  No permit for demolition of a building determined to be a preferably preserved significant building under subsection D of this section shall be granted until all proceedings relating to amendments of the zoning ordinance of the City have been completed, if such proceedings have been initiated prior to the expiration of any period of delay of demolition resulting from such determination, and if such amendments affect the site of the building whose demolition has been thereby delayed. 
G.  No permit for erection of a new structure on the site of an existing building over fifty years old may be issued prior to issuance of a permit for demolition of such existing building. 
H.  No permit for demolition of a building determined to be a preferably preserved significant building under subsection D of this section shall be granted until plans for use or development of the site after demolition have been filed with the Building Department and found to comply with all laws pertaining to the issuance of a building permit, or if for a parking lot, a certificate of occupancy, for that site. All approvals necessary for the issuance of such a building permit or certificate of occupancy including without limitation any necessary zoning variances or special permits, must be granted and all appeals from the granting of such approvals must be concluded, prior to the issuance of a demolition permit under this section. 
I.  During the six-month delay of demolition, no application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a preferably reserved significant building shall be granted until reviewed by the Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark under Article III of this chapter 2.78. Until the expiration of the six-month delay period, the Commission shall review all construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises of a preferably preserved significant building.

As used in this article "premises" refers to the parcel of land upon which the demolished building was located and all adjoining parcels of land under common ownership or control. 
C.  Securing of Building Required. Upon a determination by the Commission that a building is a preferably preserved significant building, the owner shall be responsible for properly securing the building in compliance with the regulations of the Building Department.

The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or association with a famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures; may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any area within the City containing places and structures which it determines are of importance to the architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City, and which considered together cause such area to constitute a distinctive neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior features; and may recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood conservation district theretofore made. 
B.  Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any landmark or neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the historical, architectural and other relevant significance thereof shall be made. The report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed landmark or neighborhood conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of the City Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general and/or specific standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this article and the provisions of Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in making any determination of the type referred to in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and 2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or within the designated neighborhood conservation district. 
C.  In the case of a landmark, the report shall be prepared by the Historical Commission. In the case of a neighborhood conservation district, the report shall be prepared by a study committee consisting of three members or alternates of the Historical Commission and four persons appointed by the City Manager, including at least one person who resides in the district under consideration, at least one person who owns property in the district under consideration, and one person who owns property or resides elsewhere in the City and has demonstrated knowledge and concern for conservation and enhancement of those exterior features of the City which are important to its distinctive character. 
D.  Any ten registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate, or the Historical Commission on its own may initiate, the process of designating a landmark or neighborhood conservation district or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. The Commission shall within forty-five days following the filing of such request or petition hold a preliminary hearing and arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study committee. The Historical Commission shall not reconsider a proposed designation, amendment or rescission of designation within one year of its previous hearing thereon, unless two-thirds of all its members vote to do so. No later than forty-five days after the transmittal of a report to the Commission pertaining to a proposed designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission shall give not less than fourteen days notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and by mailing notice thereof to the owner of the proposed landmark and to every owner abutting the proposed landmark or within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, each such owner to be determined from the then current records of the Assessing Department, and to the City Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk. 
E.  Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to the Planning Board for its consideration and recommendations. 
F.  The recommendation of the Historical Commission with regard to any designation, amendment or rescission shall be transmitted to the City Manager and to the City Clerk with a copy of the approved designation report. Designation of a landmark or a neighborhood conservation district or amendment or rescission of designation shall be by order of the City Council. In the case of a designation, the order shall include a statement of the reasons for such designation and a statement of standards which the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission is to apply under Sections 2.78.170 and 2.78.190 through 2.78.220 of this article.

H.  If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district contains provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive provisions of the order are funded. 
I.  Following acceptance of a designation petition by the Historical Commission, no application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a property being considered for designation shall be granted until reviewed by the Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark or a neighborhood conservation district under this Article III. Beginning with the acceptance of a designation petition and until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact the proposed designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission shall review all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other than color, of the structures on the premises of a proposed landmark or within a proposed neighborhood conservation district. 
J.  Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section 2.78.180, a neighborhood conservation district previously established by order of the City Council, in accordance with this section, which order instructs that there be a review of the activities of the neighborhood conservation district commission established pursuant to that order, following one or more public hearings by such neighborhood conservation district commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by such commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers, responsibilities and procedures of such neighborhood conservation district commission (including amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood conservation district), may be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent with the recommendations of such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the appointment of a new study committee or of a de novo study process.

D.  If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district provides, the determination of a neighborhood conservation district commission shall be binding only with regard to applications to construct a new building, to demolish an existing structure if a demolition permit is required, to construct a parking lot as a principal use, and to construct an addition to an existing structure that would increase its gross floor area, and in all other cases the determinations of a commission shall be advisory only and not binding on an applicant.

A.  The City Manager shall be responsible for engaging in a process that will result in a fair analysis of how the greatest public benefit can be obtained from the City property in question.

1.  A description and analysis of the alternative uses for the City property, including an analysis of public benefits and drawbacks and the financial impact of each alternative; 
2.  The use of the City property at the time of the recommended disposition and any actual or projected annual revenues or costs associated with such property; 
3.  The existing zoning status of the property and other City, State, and federal laws, codes, ordinances and regulations that apply to it at the time of the recommended disposition and that would apply to the various alternative uses analyzed; 
4.  Any attempts to rezone the property or to change existing laws, codes, ordinances or regulations or uses with regard to the property that have taken place within the previous five years; 
5.  The development potential of the property; 
6.  A full description of development plans proposed for the site, including traffic and parking studies and other appropriate analyses of the impact on the neighboring area and the City as a whole; 
7.  A review of the financial arrangements being recommended, including two independently prepared impartial appraisals of such property's worth that contain an independent, good faith estimate of such property's worth to the prospective buyer, transferee, or lessee. 
C.  The City Manager shall submit the report to the Planning Board and to the City Council and City Clerk for public dissemination. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing not sooner than two weeks after receipt of the report, and after study, shall submit its recommendation to the City Manager for submission to the City Council. 
D.  The City Council shall hold a public hearing within six weeks of receipt of the City Manager's recommendation and the Planning Board report. 
E.  At least fourteen days prior to the public hearings by the Planning Board and the City Council, the City Clerk shall post notice of the hearings at various conspicuous locations upon the City property, giving the purpose of the hearing in detail, and shall send this written notice to the owners of property and renters, listed on the annual street list or on the assessor's records, within three hundred feet of the City property. 
The City Clerk shall notify civic groups and neighborhood associations who may be affected by or interested in such disposition of City property and shall publish notice of said hearings in newspapers of general circulation within Cambridge at least fourteen days prior to the date of each said hearing. 
F.  The disposition of City property shall require a 2/3 vote of the City Council. 
G.  For the disposition of city property that is of such little significance that the above described process would be unduly burdensome, the City Manager may request of the City Council a diminution of this process. Approval of such a request shall require a 2/3 vote of the City Council.

The City, recognizing its commitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its citizens and employees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships. 
B.  The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners. This chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status and family status, also equalizes the treatment of City employees.

8.16.070 - Restrictions on noise emitted from construction sites. 
A.  1.  Except as provided for in subsections C and D of this section, it is unlawful for any person to operate any construction device or devices on any construction site if the operation of such device or devices emits noise, measured at the lot line of the affected property, in excess of the values shown below: 
Lot Use of Affected 	L 10 	Maximum Noise 
Property 	Level 	Level 
Residential 	75 dB(A) 	86 dB(A) 
Business or Office 	80 dB(A) 	 
Industrial 	85 dB(A) 	 
 
2.  The same level shall apply to a public way as applies to an industrial use. Measurements should not be taken closer than fifty feet or approximately fifteen meters from the nearest active construction device on the construction site. The maximum noise level shall be measured on the sound level meter at slow response. 
B.  The L 10 level shall be determined in the following manner: 
1.  Every ten seconds, on the mark, the A-weighted noise level on the sound level meter with slow response is recorded until one hundred observations have been made. If, during any of these observations, a measurement is substantially affected by any source outside the construction site (such as aircraft overflight), measurements made during these periods will not be considered. However, the observation period shall be extended until one hundred valid measurements are obtained. The L 10 level will be that level that is equal to the tenth highest level recorded. 
2.  If, in the estimation of the person taking the measurements, outside noise sources contribute significantly to the noise level, the above procedure shall be repeated (with the same outside noise source contributions) when construction is inactive, in order to determine the existing background L 10 level. The L 10 level during construction must exceed the background L 10 level by 5 dB(A) to be considered a violation of subsection A of this section. 
C.  1.  Except as provided for in subsection D of this section, it shall be unlawful to operate a construction device at any street excavation, grading or repair, utility street work installation or repair, which produces a noise level exceeding 86 dB(A) at a distance of fifty feet or approximately fifteen meters from the device. 
2.  The provisions of subsection A of this section shall not apply to any construction site covered by subdivision C(1). The provisions of this subsection will not be applicable to any construction device used in emergency service work that is necessary to return utility service to an area provided that within twenty-four hours such device is brought into compliance with this section or is not reused within the City until it does comply. 
D.  The provisions of subsections A and C of this section shall not be applicable to impact devices.

B.  Special Variances. 
1.  The License Commission shall have the authority, consistent with this section, to grant special variances which may be requested pursuant to any section of this chapter. 
2.  Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall file an application with the License Commission. The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity for which the special variance is sought into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. Notice of an application for a special variance shall be published according to procedure. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the License Commission containing any information to support his claim. If the License Commission finds that a sufficient controversy exists regarding an application, a public hearing may be held. 
3.  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the License Commission shall balance the hardship to the applicant and the community, of not granting the special variance, against the adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the special variance. The License Commission shall also consider whether the noise disturbance occurs in or across a buffer zone. Buffer zones shall be the imaginary line along the ground surface, its vertical extension, and the area at fifty feet on either side of the line, which separates a residential area from a commercial area or an industrial area. Applicants for special variances and other persons contesting special variances may be required to submit any information the License Commission may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the License Commission shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying the special variance. 
4.  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted. 
5.  Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances under subdivision (2). 
6.  The License Commission may issue guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a special variance. 
C.  Variances for Time to Comply. 
1.  Within sixty days following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the owner of any commercial or industrial source of sound may apply to the License Commission for a variance in time to comply with Section 8.16.080I, vibration, or Section 8.16.060, measured noise disturbance. 
2.  Any person seeking a variance in time to comply shall file an application with the License Commission. The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity for which the variance is sought into compliance with this chapter prior to the date requested in the application would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. Notice of an application for a variance in time to comply shall be published according to procedure. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the variance in time to comply may file a statement with the License Commission containing any information to support his claim. If the License Commission finds that a sufficient controversy exists regarding an application, a public hearing may be held. 
3.  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the License Commission shall balance the hardship to the applicant and the community, of not granting the variance in time to comply against the adverse impact on health, safety, and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the variance. The License Commission shall also consider whether the noise disturbance occurs in or across a buffer zone. Buffer zones shall be the imaginary line along the ground surface, its vertical extension and the area at fifty feet on either side of the line which separates a residential area from a commercial area or an industrial area. Applicants for variances in time to comply and persons contesting variances may be required to submit any information the License Commission may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the License Commission shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the variance in time to comply. 
4.  Variances in time to comply shall be granted to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a schedule for achieving compliance. The variance in time to comply shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the variance shall terminate the variance and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this chapter for which the variance was granted. 
5.  Application for extension of time limits specified in variances in time to comply or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial variances under subsection B of Section 8.16.090, except that the License Commission must find that the need for the extension or modification clearly outweighs any adverse impacts of granting the extension or modifications. 
6.  The License Commission may issue guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a variance in time to comply and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a variance. 
D.  Reconsideration. Any person aggrieved by a decision or action of the authorized enforcement officials may, within ten business days of said decision or action, request reconsideration of same by the official.

1.  Residential Dwellings. 
a.  As long as funds are available, the City will provide one household recycling receptacle to each dwelling unit in residential dwellings with six or fewer units that are not primarily used to house students and/or staff of nonprofit establishments. The City shall retain ownership of all its household recycling receptacles and the resident of each dwelling unit shall take proper care to protect such receptacle from loss or damage. Receptacles that are lost or stolen will be replaced by the City as long as the City's supplies last. After City supplies are depleted, it shall be the responsibility of the resident of each dwelling unit to obtain a suitable replacement within forty-five days. In such buildings, the materials designated for recycling in rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner shall be placed in the household recycling receptacles. 
b.  As long as funds are available, the City will provide a suitable number of household recycling receptacles and/or toters to buildings with seven or more units that are not primarily used to house students and/or staff of nonprofit establishments.

In such buildings, the materials designated for recycling in rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner shall be placed in the household recycling receptacles and/or toters. If owners or occupants desire recyclables collection from a location on private property, collection more than once a week, or larger containers than the City provides, they must arrange for private collection of recyclables and are responsible for the costs of collection. 
c.  During the leaf and yard waste collection season, owners or occupants shall place their leaves and yard waste in paper leaf bags (as defined in subsection C of this section) or open barrels to be provided by the owner or occupant. Barrels must be marked with City-approved yard waste labels.

f.  Recyclables shall not be placed in plastic garbage bags for collection, removal or disposal. Recyclables shall not be placed in the same refuse containers as rubbish or mixed with rubbish or litter for collection, removal or disposal. If separation of recyclable materials from rubbish does not take place, the City may decide not to collect said rubbish. 
g.  Upon placement of recyclables for the City or its contractor at the curbside, pursuant to this subsection, such recyclables shall become the property of the City. It shall be a violation of this section if any person, other than authorized agents of the City acting in the course of their employment or contract, collects or causes to be collected any recyclables so placed. Each and every such collection in violation of this subdivision from one or more locations shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the penalty provided in subsection I of this section, any violator of this subsection shall make restitution to the City for the value of recyclables illegally removed.

Any savings in solid waste disposal realized due to recycling shall accrue to the owner or owners of such buildings.

Chapter 8.29 - REGULATION OF THE SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS THROUGH VENDING MACHINES 
 
8.29.010 - Declaration of legislative findings. 
The City Council finds that the vast majority of smokers begin smoking in their teens or preteens. The health hazards posed by cigarettes and other tobacco products are well documented and the sale of tobacco in any form to persons under the age of eighteen is prohibited in this Commonwealth. However, cigarette vending machines in public places have provided unsupervised minors with easy access to cigarettes, in contravention of the policy in this Commonwealth. Accordingly, the City Council finds that the ability of unsupervised minors to obtain cigarettes and other tobacco products in violation of the law will be significantly reduced by regulating vending machines which dispense such products.

Chapter 8.44 - RENT CONTROL* 
* Prior ordinance history: Ords. 926, 929, 932, 941 and 945. 
 
8.44.010 - Findings of fact. 
A serious public emergency continues to exist in the City with respect to the housing of a substantial number of citizens, as declared by Chapter 36 of the Acts of 1976, for the reasons stated in the Act. The emergency has worsened since 1976 because of the removal of a substantial number of rental housing units from the market, by condominium conversion, demolition and other causes. As a result, more than two thousand or over ten percent of the controlled rental units in the City have been removed from the housing market since 1970, and the vacancy rate has fallen below one percent. In order to carry out the purposes of the Act, and to continue to provide a sufficient supply of decent, affordable rental housing accommodations especially for families of low and moderate income and for elderly people on fixed incomes, it is necessary for the City Council, in the exercise of its powers under Section 6 of the Home Rule Amendment and under Section 5(c) of the Act, to regulate the removal of controlled rental housing units from the market. 
(Ord. 966 (part), 1981: prior code Ch. 23 § 1(a))  
8.44.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
A.  "Act" means Chapter 36 of the Acts of 1976, as amended from time to time. 
B.  "Board" means the Rent Control Board established by Section 5 of the Act. 
C.  "Controlled rental unit" means any unit included in the definition under Section 3(b) of the Act. 
D.  "Removal from the market," as applied to a controlled rental unit, means and includes but is not limited to: 
1.  Occupy as an owner of a unit which is a condominium unit, if the most recent occupant was a tenant, even if the prospective owner-occupant is the tenant, unless the prospective owner-occupant is the current tenant of the unit who has continuously occupied it as a tenant since before August 10, 1979, and intends in good faith to occupy it indefinitely as its owner; or 
2.  Demolish, but no unit has been removed from the market by demolition until its physical destruction has begun; or 
3.  Rehabilitate, repair or improve, other than as required by the laws of the Commonwealth or the City, in such a way as to prevent residential occupancy during the course of the rehabilitation, repair or improvement. This provision shall not apply to rehabilitation, financed at least in part by community development block grant funds, of a building owned by a nonprofit corproation and intended for owner-occupancy by low and moderate income persons; or 
4.  Convert to a cooperative as the term is used in Section 3(b)(4) of the Act, all or part of any building which contains any controlled rental unit; 
5.  Cause a unit, not the primary residence of a legal unit owner, to be vacant for one hundred twenty days or more by refusing to rent or to offer for rent such unit in good faith or, when a unit is cited as unfit for human habitation, by failure to perform repairs required to restore such unit to habitable condition. The existence of a vacancy for one hundred twenty days or more, without a showing of good cause, shall constitute removal from the market; 
6.  Prior to April 1, 1995, record a master deed pursuant to the provisions of G.L. c.183A or file articles or organization pursuant to G.L. c.156B or c.157, or advertising, offering for sale or selling a unit as a condominium or cooperative unit; 
7.  "Removal from the market" does not include occupancy of a noncondominium unit by the owner of the building in which it is located or by any member of his/her immediate family; or a condominium unit which the owner occupied before the tenant occupied it; or a condominium unit as to which unit it can be shown with respect to its initial sale after the recording of the master deed that a purchase and sale agreement has been entered into prior to August 10, 1979, a cancelled check being conclusive proof of the transaction, or a unit deed recorded in the Middlesex Registry of Deeds prior to August 10, 1979, whether or not the unit was being used for rental housing on August 13, 1979. No condominium unit once legally occupied by the unit owner shall ever again be subject to this chapter for any reason. 
(Ord. 1161, 1994; Ord. 1159 §§ 1, 2, 1994; Ord. 1095, 1990; Ord. 1093, 1989; Ord. 1014 § 1, 1984; Ord. 980 § 2, 1982; Ord. 966 (part), 1981: prior code Ch. 23 § 1(b))  
8.44.030 - Applicability of chapter provisions. 
A.  This chapter shall apply to all controlled rental units which have not been removed from the market before August 13, 1979. This section shall take effect immediately, but cease to be effective if the Board files its certificate with the City Clerk that: 
1.  The vacancy rate in the total supply of controlled rental units exceeds four percent; or 
2.  The total number of rental units in the City excluding public housing units, exceeds that number as of January 1, 1970. 
B.  If such a certificate ceases to be correct, the Board shall withdraw it by filing a certificate, and this section shall then again be effective until one of the above conditions again prevails. 
(Ord. 966 (part), 1981: prior code Ch. 23 § 1(e))  
8.44.040 - Removal of controlled rental unitPermit requiredHearing. 
A.  No owner or other person shall remove from the market any controlled rental unit, unless the Board after a hearing grants a permit. The Board may issue orders and promulgate regulations to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, and to prescribe the procedure for applications, notice, hearings and the granting and withdrawal of permits. A permit to remove from the market a unit in a building converted or proposed to be converted to a condominium may be granted to the owner of the building before the sale of a unit. 
B.  One year after the date of a notice of ruling, the Board shall review and confirm that the circumstances and conditions which led the Board to grant any removal permit under this chapter, except for a condominium unit legally occupied by the unit owner, continue to warrant such permit. If, after a hearing, the Board finds that the circumstances and conditions no longer warrant the permit, the Board shall immediately treat the unit as a controlled rental unit and shall initiate whatever action is permitted and appropriate under this chapter. 
(Ord. 1014 § 2, 1984; Ord. 966 (part), 1981: prior code Ch. 23 § 1(c))  
8.44.050 - PermitCriteria considerations. 
In deciding whether to grant a permit under this chapter, the Board shall consider: 
A.  The benefits to the persons sought to be protected by the Act and by this chapter; 
B.  The hardships imposed on the tenants residing in the unit proposed to be removed, including any mitigating provisions made by the applicant; and 
C.  Any aggravation of the shortage of decent rental housing accommodations, especially for families of low and moderate income and elderly people on fixed incomes, which may result from the removal. 
(Ord. 966 (part), 1981: prior code Ch. 23 § 1(d))  
8.44.060 - Limited equity cooperative ownership. 
A.  As used in this section, "Administrator" means the Assistant City Manager for Community Development or his or her designee. Notwithstanding the considerations of Section 8.44.050 of this chapter, the Board may grant a permit for conversions to limited equity cooperatives only if the Administrator files with the Board an agreement executed by the Administrator and the cooperative housing corporation which shall contain the following provisions: 
1.  All cooperative documents and all amendments or modifications of the cooperative documents shall be valid only if executed by the Administrator and the articles of incorporation shall so provide. The cooperative documents include the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, occupancy agreements, transfer agreements and management plan. Each transfer shall be reported to the Administrator and all documents effecting the transfer shall be executed by the Administrator. The Administrator shall execute documents only if each of the provisions of this section are met. 
2.  a.  The resale price of the cooperator's membership which includes the right to occupy the unit shall not exceed the transfer value plus the amount of principal amortized by the corporation on its blanket mortgage attributed to the unit and paid by the member involved, less any amounts due to the corporation under the occupancy agreement and less the cost of all deferred maintenance and repairs deemed necessary by the corporation to put the dwelling in a suitable condition for another occupant. 
b.  The transfer value is the sum of: 
i.  The share value paid by the former occupant of the unit (not including the amount of any subsidies) adjusted from the date of the stock payment to the Consumer Price Index for Housing for the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
ii.  The value of improvements approved by the corporation and installed by the member in his unit, including a fair value of labor denoted by a member or others as conclusively established by the Administrator at the time the labor is donated. 
3.  Residents of at least eighty percent of the units in the building as of the date of the articles of incorporation shall sign commitments to become resident shareholders of the limited equity housing corporation. 
4.  A majority of the current residents must be low and moderate income persons as defined by the current income limits set forth in regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, under Section 235 of the National Housing Act or its successor or comparable index as determined by the Administrator. 
5.  Current residents who do not become shareholders shall have the right to remain in their units as tenants of the cooperative corporation. Controlled rental units shall remain subject to the Act and to this section and no permits shall issue for controlled rental units while occupied by non-shareholding tenants.

For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following definitions shall apply: 
a.  "Adequately Wet" means sufficiently mixed or penetrated with water to completely prevent the release of particulate material into the ambient air. 
b.  "Asbestos-contaminated soil" means soil which has been shown by certified laboratory analysis to contain at least one percent (1%) (normalized area) asbestos, using the Protocol for Screening Soil and Sediment Samples for Asbestos Content, most currently used by the U.S. EPA Region I laboratory and soil within thirty-five (35) feet of a sampling location in which asbestos has been detected on property shown to contain soil with at least one percent (1%) asbestos as defined above and soil the Commissioner reasonably expects may contain at least one percent (1%) asbestos based on data from an approved Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan. 
c.  "Asbestos" or "Asbestiform" means the following hydrated minerals: chrysotile (fibrous serpentine), crocidolite (fibrous riebeckite), amosite (fibrous cummingtonite-grunerite), fibrous tremolite, fibrous actinolite, and fibrous anthophyllite. 
d.  "City" means the City of Cambridge. 
e.  "Commissioner" means the City of Cambridge Commissioner of Health or his/her designee. 
f.  "Responsible party" means the owner of the property in question or an agent assigned by the owner. 
g.  "Soil-disturbing activities" means excavation, grading, tilling, or any other such activity that may cause release of fugitive dust. Disturbance shall not include direct-push or vibratory installation or extraction of piles, sheet pile, or wells, but shall include any excavation in the vicinity of such direct-push or vibratory installation, e.g. for the construction of pile caps. Disturbance also shall not include drilling of boreholes twelve (12) inches in diameter or less by hollow stem auger or similar method for the purpose of environmental evaluation or remediation.  
8.61.020 - Jurisdiction. 
Any property found by the Commissioner to contain asbestos-contaminated soil or documented to the Commissioner's satisfaction to have been the site of past industrial asbestos on-site handling, disposal, processing or manufacturing, shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance.  
8.61.030 - Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan. 
a.  Such a property, once determined to be subject to the provisions of this ordinance and prior to any soil disturbing activity, will require an Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan to be submitted for approval to the Commissioner at the Cambridge Public Health Department. 
b.  If no soil-disturbing activity is anticipated in asbestos-contaminated soil, the property will not be required to submit an Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan. However, all properties with asbestos-contaminated soil will receive a Notice of Asbestos-Contaminated Soil which will be maintained as a public record by the City's Inspectional Services Department and Public Health Department. 
For such properties on which no soil-disturbing activity is anticipated, no further action will then be required. Any subsequent soil-disturbing activity contemplated by the responsible party will make that property subject to the provisions detailed in this ordinance and will require the responsible party to submit an Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan as described herein. Each property where it is proven to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that asbestos-contaminated soil no longer exists shall have its Notice of Asbestos-Contaminated Soil rescinded. 
c.  The minimum requirement for an Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan is composite sampling to a depth of at least three (3) feet, or to the maximum depth of proposed soil-disturbing activities, using thirty-five (35) foot on-center sample locations distributed across the site in all areas where soil disturbing activities are proposed or anticipated. The Commissioner must approve the Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan before sampling at the site begins. Once completed, the data generated under the sampling plan will be submitted to the Commissioner and maintained by the Commissioner as a public record. Areas of asbestos-contaminated soil which are to be subject to soil-disturbing activities may require further characterization as determined by the Commissioner.  
8.61.040 - Asbestos Soil Management Plan. 
Upon completion of all required asbestos analysis provisions, the responsible party shall undertake precautions to prevent fugitive dust from being generated and/or escaping during any soil-disturbing activities. These measures must be detailed in an Asbestos Soil Management Plan. 
a.  This plan shall be submitted to the Commissioner for prior approval and shall include one or more of the following particulate dust mitigation and assurance measures: 
(i)  assuring that the soil is adequately wet during soil disturbing activities; 
(ii)  erecting wind fences around the area containing asbestos-contaminated soil during the entire time that it is being disturbed; 
(iii)  conducting hourly air monitoring for particulate dust and continuous air monitoring for airborne asbestos around the perimeter of the soil-disturbing activity; 
(iv)  covering the site with a layer of clean fill, which must be of sufficient depth such that the proposed disturbance of the soil would occur in and affect only that clean fill layer; 
(v)  erecting a permanent or temporary structure maintained at partial vacuum sufficient to contain all fugitive dust, with off gas from the evacuation system treated with HEPA filtration; 
b.  Each Asbestos Soil Management Plan will include a contingency plan for immediate work stoppage in the event that dust standards established in the Asbestos Soil Management Plan are exceeded in any two hourly field tests over a 24-hour period. Each Asbestos Soil Management Plan will also include a contingency plan for work stoppage in the event that the airborne asbestos standard established in the Asbestos Soil Management Plan is exceeded after continuous daily testing has been completed, no later than 24 hours after the cumulative daily samples have been collected. Work may recommence when containment measures deemed sufficient by the Commissioner to prevent further exeedences have been implemented. Any further exceedences will result in immediate work stoppage. 
c.  Prior to the final decision on the Asbestos Soil Management Plan, the Commissioner shall make available for public review for a period of 20 calendar days all data resulting from the Asbestos Soil Sampling Plan, the proposed Asbestos Soil Management Plan, and the Commissioner's draft decision. The applicant shall provide written notice of the availability of the documents to abutters and to any person who otherwise requests notice and shall provide copies of the soil sampling results, proposed Asbestos Soil Management Plan, and Commissioner's draft decision upon request. A copy of the documents shall be available for public viewing at the Commissioner's office and the main branch of the Cambridge Public Library. Public comments shall be submitted in writing to the Commissioner and must be received by the Commissioner prior to the end of the 20-calendar day period in order to be considered. 
Mitigation measures (a) (iv) and/or (a) (v) must be include in the soil management plan if any of the following conditions are present: 
(a)  the level of contamination is serious, i.e. at least one 5% asbestos sample and a mass of asbestos greater than 20,000 pounds; 
(b)  the proposed soil disturbance is extensive, i.e. 20,000 ft. footprint or greater; 
(c)  the proposed soil disturbance is in close proximity to residential areas or children's play areas, i.e. within 500 feet.  
8.61.050 - Access to Property. 
The Commissioner or his/her independent consultants shall have reasonable access to the property subject to this ordinance in order to assure that provisions of this ordinance and the Asbestos Soil Management Plan are being followed to the Commissioner's satisfaction.

It is the intent of this ordinance that the Inspectional Services Department and the Community Development Department collaborate with the Commissioner and each other to ensure that the public health and safety is protected. To that end the Departments shall cooperate, share information and develop a coordinated protocol for implementing this ordinance. In addition, no building permit shall be issued for a site without prior approval of the Asbestos Soil Management Plan by the Commissioner.  
8.61.090 - Enforcement and Penalties. 
a.  Any violation of this ordinance is punishable by a fine of up to $300. Each day that a violation continues may constitute a separate violation, and each one thousand square feet of total lot size at which a violation occurs may constitute a separate violation. This penalty may be enforced through criminal proceedings or non-criminally, by ticketing, as provided in General Laws Chapter 40, Section 21D. The Commissioner shall be the enforcing officer.

Chapter 10.17 - VEHICLE TRIP REDUCTION ORDINANCE 
Sections: 
 
10.17.010 - Time period of chapter. 
Sections 10.17.040 through 10.17.180 of this chapter shall take effect sixty days after final approval by the City Council. The remaining provisions shall not take effect until, and shall at that time supersede and replace Chapter 10.16, sixty days after final approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA") of a SIP amendment for Massachusetts which (i) contains a program of transportation control measures that are imposed equally on all communities in the Commonwealth such as an employer-based vehicle trip reduction program; and (ii) revokes any provisions of 40 C.F.R. Section 52.1135 that are applicable to Cambridge. 
(Ord. 1139 (part), 1992)  
10.17.020 - Findings. 
The City of Cambridge finds and determines that: 
A.  High levels of vehicle traffic and congestion add to air pollution, noise, and inconvenience and erode the quality of the living and working environment. 
B.  An increasing number of automobile registrations and jobs in the City has resulted in growth of traffic in and around Cambridge. 
C.  While the City has pursued programs to mitigate these conditions, new measures must be implemented by the City and the Commonwealth involving the participation of all sectors of the community on a local and regional bases to make more efficient use of mass transit, bicycling, walking, and other alternatives to trips by single-occupancy vehicles. 
D.  The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 call for the attainment of compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone within the Commonwealth by 1999. 
E.  Attainment of the Ozone Standard will require increased control of vehicle-related air pollution ("transportation control measures") throughout the Commonwealth, as well as the Nation. 
F.  Throughtrips and other traffic over which Cambridge has no control contribute significantly to the degradation of air quality in the region. The degradation of air quality, particularly ozone, is a regional problem which requires global and regional solutions. 
G.  A large portion of vehicle traffic on Cambridge streets is attributable to trips that neither originate nor end in Cambridge ("throughtrips"). The City of Cambridge has virtually no control over these throughtrips. Accordingly, it is imperative that DEP amend the SIP to include transportation control measures applicable equally to all communities in the Commonwealth, including an employer-based vehicle trip reduction program, to achieve reductions in the number of vehicle trips and vehicle miles travelled throughout the region. 
H.  Increasing the use of commuting alternatives and reducing the number of trips by single-occupancy vehicles is beneficial for the City and the Commonwealth in reducing vehicle miles travelled, traffic and associated air pollution, fuel use, noise, and congestion. 
I.  Programs offered through City Departments, employers, institutions, owners of multiple-tenant buildings and complexes and other organizations to encourage the use of mass transit, bicycling walking, and other alternatives to commuting by single-occupancy vehicles are effective and should be expanded on a citywide and regional basis. 
J.  The approach which includes, where consistent with employers' needs, adoption and enforcement of driving disincentives, particularly those applicable to the regular work-day commuter, and best suited to accommodate the diverse needs and capabilities of the governmental, business and institutional communities in the City, and recommended for adoption by DEP for state-wide application is a flexible approach which establishes performance coals and permits government and private employers, institutions, and automobile owners to select from among a variety of measures designed to contribute toward reaching the goals. 
K.  The vehicle trip reduction program recommended for adoption by DEP on a state-wide basis should give credit to those employers which have already made substantial progress in encouraging the use of mass transit, bicycling, walking, and alternative means of commuting and in providing such alternatives. 
L.  Measures to discourage, and provide alternatives to, vehicle trips and trips by single-occupancy vehicles made by residents of and visitors to Cambridge are also necessary to further the goals of the Clean Air Act. 
M.  Some of the measures contained in this chapter will achieve immediate reductions in vehicle miles travelled; others are designed to collect information and otherwise lay the foundation for future actions to reduce vehicle miles travelled and improve air quality. To maximize air quality benefits, some types of transportation control measures must be adopted and applied on a regional basis.

Bicycles, public transit vehicles, and approved clean-fuel vehicles shall be excluded from the vehicles counted. Motorcycles and light trucks shall be included in the vehicles counted. 
F.  The City shall define and make calculations of a base AER for the City of Cambridge as a whole. Such base AER shall initially be derived from the 1990 Census modal share data and travel statistics, the results of the pilot survey of selected employers, and such other data as may be relevant. Subsequently, the City may develop other AERs for categories such as geographical areas of the City, employer types, employer sizes, and the like, as may be determined through the consultative process provided for in Section 10.17.140. The City may also, through the same consultative process, periodically recalculate the base AER or such other AERs to reflect additional data or changes in data as become available. 
G.  The term "carpool" shall mean a private motor vehicle occupied by two to six employees travelling together for at least seventy-five percent of their commute trip distances.

(i)  Facts and Projections: 
- nature of development and property use; 
- proximity of project to public transit and other non-Single-Occupant Vehicle facilities; 
- availability of and accessibility to offsite parking spaces which could serve the project; 
- number of employees and their likely place of origin; and 
- type and number of patrons/users of proposed parking supply and their likely place of origin. 
- number of vehicle trips expected to be generated by the project and description of measures to reduce associated traffic impacts on Cambridge streets; and 
- other factors published by the Planning Officer. 
(ii)  Commitments: 
- commitment to work with the Cambridge Office of Work Force Development; 
- commitment to implement vehicle trip reduction measures including some or all of the following: 
subsidized MBTA passes and other incentives; shuttle services; ride-sharing services; bicycle and pedestrian facilities; flexible working hours; preferential parking for Low Emission Vehicles/Zero Emission Vehicles/bicycles/carpools/vanpools (Note: this list is not meant to preclude implementation of other types of vehicle trip reduction measures). This commitment must be accompanied by a detailed description of the measures proposed to be implemented; and 
commitment to establish and make reasonable efforts to achieve a specified, numeric reduction (or percent reduction) in single-occupant vehicle trips in and around Cambridge. The percent reduction will be based on PTDM practices successfully implemented in reasonably comparable environments and as identified in professional and academic literature and based on analysis of existing trip reduction measures in Cambridge. 
Each PTDM Plan shall identify the total number of existing and proposed parking spaces at the facility and specify how many existing and proposed spaces fall within each of the following categories (explain how many spaces are used for multiple purposes):

Decisions of the Planning Officer may be appealed by the project proponent to a review committee composed of the City Manager, or his designee, and two other City staff members designated by the City Manager none of whom may have participated in the initial review of the Plan. 
(e)  The Planning Officer shall also make available sample PTDM plans which a project proponent may adapt for their project, such to approval by the Planning Officer. 
(f)  No permit, commercial parking permit, special permit, variance, building permit, certificate of occupancy, or operating license shall be issued for any project subject to 10.18.050 by the Planning Board, Commercial Parking Control Committee, Board of Zoning Appeal, Commissioner of Inspectional Services, or License Commission absent a written decision indicating approval from the Planning Officer of the project proponent's PTDM Plan. Any such permit or license shall be consistent with, and may incorporate as a condition, the decision of the Planning Officer and shall include written notice of the requirements of 10.18.050 (g) and (h), below. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to limit the power of the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal to grant variances from or special permits under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. No project proponent shall be required by the Planning Officer to seek such relief under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. 
(g)  Approvals issued by the Planning Officer shall be automatically transferrable by and among private parties, provided that the proposed new owner (the "Transferee") shall continue to operate under the existing PTDM Plan and shall submit to the Planning Officer within thirty (30) days of the title transfer a certification that the existing PTDM plan will remain in effect. The certification shall be submitted on a form issued by the Planning Officer and shall certify that such Transferee commits to implement the existing PTDM plan, as approved; and acknowledges that failure to implement the plan is subject to the enforcement provisions of this Chapter. Where such certification is submitted, the approved plan shall remain in effect as to the Transferee. The Transferee may elect instead to and consult with the Planning Officer within thirty (30) days of title transfer regarding appropriate revisions to the existing plan. Based on such consultation, the Planning Officer may require information from the Transferee concerning proposed changes in use of the parking facility and associated buildings and the relevant facts and projections regarding the proposed changes. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such information, the Planning Officer may issue a written approval of the revised plan and obligations to the Transferee, or the Planning Officer may require submittal of a new PTDM Plan from the Transferee for review, condition, approval and/or denial. Until such time as a new or revised plan has been approved, the existing PTDM plan shall remain in effect. 
(h)  Each PTDM Plan approval issued by the Planning Officer shall contain, at a minimum, the following conditions:

12.16.170 - Street performers. 
A.  Introduction. The City Council of the City of Cambridge (the "City") finds that the existence in the City of street performers provides a public amenity that enhances the character of the City and seeks to encourage such performances to the extent that they do not interfere with the reasonable expectations of residents to the enjoyment of peace and quiet in their homes, the ability of businesses to conduct their businesses uninterrupted, or for the free flow of traffic and movement on public ways, public sidewalks, and other public pedestrian areas (collectively hereinafter referred to as "Public Ways"). This Section seeks to balance the interests of the performers with those of the residents and businesses of the City. 
B.  Enforcement. The City Council designates the Cambridge Arts Council (the "Arts Council") to be the department of the City primarily charged with the responsibility of supervising and enforcing the provisions of this Section. 
C.  Definitions. 
1.  "Perform" includes, but is not limited to, the following activities: acting; singing; playing musical instruments; pantomime; juggling; magic; dancing; reading; reciting; puppetry; and sidewalk art (working with non-permanent, water-soluble media, such as chalk, pastels, or watercolors, directly on the pavement). 
"Perform" shall not include the production of items for sale, such as jewelry making or craft production, but may include the creation of visual artworks that are demonstrated live in a large-scale performative manner. 
2.  "Performer" means a person who has obtained a Permit pursuant to this Section. 
3.  A "Performing Group" means a group of four or more Performers who perform together, are identified as such in their permit application, and noted as such on their Permits. All Performers acquiring a Permit for a group performance must perform as a group; group Permits do not authorize individual performance. 
4.  "Public Areas" means Public Ways, parks, plazas, and playgrounds. 
D.  Prohibition. 
1.  No person may perform in a Public Area without a Permit issued by the Arts Council pursuant to Subsection E. of this Section. 
2.  In accordance with the Cambridge Fire Department's (the "Fire Department's") rules promulgated by the Cambridge Fire Chief (the "Fire Chief") pursuant to his authority under G. L. c. 148, § 28 and the Code of Massachusetts Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the use of fire in a public assembly, including, but not limited to, street performing, is not permitted in the City. 
E.  Permit. 
1.  A Permit shall be issued by the Arts Council to each applicant in exchange for a completed application at no fee. 
Each applicant for a Permit must present valid identification at the time of submitting the application for a Permit. 
2.  A completed application for a Permit shall contain the applicant's name, residential address, contact information, including e-mail address and telephone number, group name, if applicable, instrumentation, and type of performance, and shall be signed by the applicant. 
3.  A Permit shall contain the Performer's name; group name, if applicable; Permit number; date issued; year in which the Permit is valid; and a brief description of the type of performance permitted.

1.  A Performer shall clearly display the Performer's Permit while performing and shall allow inspection of the Permit by any Cambridge Police Officer ("Police Officer") or staff person of the Arts Council upon request. Refusal to allow inspection of a Permit upon request by a Police Officer or staff person of the Arts Council, or refusal to display a Permit, may result in the revocation of the Permit. 
G.  Permitted Performances. 
1.  Performances may take place in the following locations: 
a.  In Public Areas when not interfering with use of a park permit, special events permit, or regular use of playgrounds, except, within one hundred (100) feet of an elementary and/or secondary school, library, church, synagogue, temple, mosque, or other house of worship while in session, or a hospital at any time; and any areas excluded by the City Council, the Commissioner of the Cambridge Public Works Department (the "Commissioner of Public Works"), the Police Commissioner of the Cambridge Police Department (the "Police Commissioner"), or the Fire Chief, pursuant to Subsection H of this Section;

3.  Sound and Noise Regulations: 
a.  No Performer or Performing Group may generate noise exceeding a median sound level of eighty decibels (80 db(A)) measured at a distance of twenty-five (25) feet from the Performer or Performing Group. A Performer or Performing Group may use sound amplification as long as eighty decibels (80 db(A)) measured at a distance of twenty-five (25) feet from the Performer or Performing Group is not exceeded. Upon receipt of a complaint, a designated staff person from the Arts Council shall, with the permission of the complainant, measure the sound level inside the structure wherein the occupant has complained of noise from a street performance. If the sound level inside the structure wherein the occupant has complained of noise from a street performance exceeds a median sound level of fifty decibels (50 db(A)), and exceeds the background noise by at least ten decibels (10 db(A)), the Performer or Performing Group causing the excessive sound level shall either turn down the music or move to a distance from the structure so as to reduce the sound level to a level within these limitations. Background Noise will be measured using the L90 statistical value. 
b.  It shall be prohibited to use prerecorded music as part of a performance, except as backup accompaniment to a live performance. All prerecorded music shall be turned off when the Performer or Performing Group is not performing. The volume of prerecorded music shall not exceed fifty (50) decibels db(A) on its own or eighty (80) decibels db(A) with music/audio accompaniment. 
c.  Drums shall be inaudible at a distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
4.  A Performer or Performing Group may not create an undue interference with the passage of the public through a Public Area. If a Performer or Performing Group attracts a crowd sufficient to obstruct a Public Area as defined in this Section, the Performer or Performing Group shall encourage the crowd to relocate and no longer obstruct the Public Area. A Police Officer may disperse the portion of the crowd that is creating the obstruction. The Police Officer shall not cause the Performer to leave the location unless efforts to move the crowd fail to adequately protect the public safety or order. A Police Officer shall not ask the Performer to leave the location unless all other means of restoring the public safety or order have been exhausted. 
5.  No Performer or Performing Group may perform within fifty (50) feet of another performer or group of performers. 
6.  A Performer or Performing Group may request contributions of money or property at a performance, provided that signs requesting contributions shall not exceed twelve (12) inches by eighteen (18) inches in size. Contributions may be received in any receptacle, such as an open musical instrument case, box or hat. Performers may offer for sale items of their own artistic works if said items directly relate to the performance for which they are permitted to perform. 
7.  On sidewalks, displays must not obstruct accessibility ramps, doorways, or windows (i.e., Performers shall not tape or post signs or posters on windows or lean displays against windows so as to obstruct a clear view through the window), and must not exceed more than twenty percent (20%) of the width of the sidewalk from the property line of the premises in front of which the display is installed. Displays and/or Performer setups must be located at least ten (10) feet away from business doorways. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Performer may set up a display on the public sidewalk in front of a doorway to a business if the business is not open, assuming said display meets all other requirements of this Section. A Performer or Performing Group shall be required at all times to maintain four and one-half (4½) feet of sidewalk between their setup and the edge of the sidewalk in order to allow for accessibility for persons with disabilities. 
8.  In Public Areas other than sidewalks, no such display shall exceed twenty-five (25) square feet, and it shall be prohibited to place a carpet, rug, blanket, tent or other such covering over grass in a Public Area. No tents may be erected in Public Areas without a tent permit from the Fire Department. Any tent permit received from the Fire Department must be current and on display at all times while any such tent is erected. Tables and chairs may be used as long as they do not exceed the maximum footprint outlined in this Section. 
9.  Unless otherwise provided in rules and regulations promulgated by the Arts Council pursuant to Subsection J. of this Section, performance locations/spaces are first come, first served, and cannot be reserved with equipment, apparatus, or by persons not permitted to perform. Live performance must take place at all times while a Performer, or Performing Group, is set up. Fifteen (15) minute breaks between sets are allowed once per hour. 
10.  It shall be prohibited to use public furniture, whether movable or immovable, or Public Art structures as part of a performance setup or for the storage of equipment, displays, supplies, or materials used in any performance. 
H.  Exclusion of Public Areas. 
1.  A specific Public Area may be excluded from performances in accordance with a decision of the City Council after a public hearing, notice of which shall be advertised once in a local newspaper and on the Arts Council's website, no less than fourteen (14) days prior to said hearing. In addition, a written notice shall be sent to Community Arts Advocates, Inc., or its successor(s), not less than ten (10) days prior to said hearing. 
a.  Based upon evidence presented to the City Council during its deliberations on the adoption of this Section, the City Council designated Brattle Street on both sides from the northerly side of Church Street to the northerly lot line of 76 Brattle Street as an excluded area, thereby prohibiting performances in that area. 
2.  In the case of an emergency, the Police Commissioner or the Fire Chief may prohibit a Performer or Performing Group from performing in a particular location. In the case of such an emergency, any holder of a Permit who disputes the need for said emergency performance prohibition may appeal to the City Council for review. 
3.  In the case of an emergency, the Commissioner of Public Works may prohibit a Performer or Performing Group from performing in a particular park or playground. In the case of such an emergency, any holder of a Permit who disputes the need for said emergency performance prohibition may appeal to the City Council for review.

b.  a Performer fails to clearly display the Performer's Permit while performing; or 
c.  a Performer fails to allow inspection of the Performer's Permit by any Police Officer or any Arts Council staff upon request. 
4.  Before suspending or revoking a Permit, the Arts Council must hold a public hearing, after ten (10) days' written notice to the Performer setting forth the facts constituting the basis for the proposed suspension or revocation. 
5.  A Performer may not receive a Permit unless all tickets issued pursuant to this Section from the previous calendar year(s) have been paid in full. 
J.  Regulations. The Arts Council shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section, with the approval of the City Manager, as may be appropriate or necessary for the implementation of this Section. 
K.  Exclusivity. The provisions of this Section take precedence over any other City regulations or ordinances applicable to street performances. To the extent other City regulations or ordinances are applicable and are inconsistent with this Section, this Section shall govern.

The Commissioner may choose the locations for corrals and hitching posts based on the history of misaligned or knocked over newsracks at the location, the high volume of pedestrian traffic at the location, or the relatively high concentration of newsracks at the location. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the locations at which corrals and hitching posts may be required.

The Commission may, in like manner, make, sign, and file such a complaint whenever it has reason to believe that any person has engaged in, or is engaging in an unlawful practice. 
B.  No complaint shall be considered unless it is filed within one hundred eighty days after the occurrence of the alleged unlawful practice, or in the case of continuing unlawful practices, within one hundred eighty days after the termination of the unlawful practices. A complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time. A complaint referred to the Commission by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination after having been timely filed there will be considered filed for the purposes of this chapter. 
C.  The filing of a complaint, the failure to file a complaint, or the dismissal of a complaint by the Commission shall not bar an aggrieved person from filing a civil action in the Superior Court within two years after the occurrence or termination of an alleged discriminatory practice; provided, that the aggrieved person may not initiate an action with respect to an alleged discriminatory practice that forms the basis of a charged issued by the Commission, if a Commission's hearing has begun with respect to the charge. The Court shall be empowered to award the plaintiff actual and punitive damages; grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any temporary or permanent injunction, temporary restraining order or other order; and allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff shall be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and costs only to the extent that the plaintiff's participation in the proceeding was frivolous or vexatious or was for the purpose of harassment; to the extent that the plaintiff is the prevailing party, the respondent shall be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and costs, unless special circumstances make recovery of such fees and costs unjust. 
D.  Upon the filing of the complaint, the Commission shall, by certified mail, return receipt requested, serve notice upon the complainant acknowledging the filing and advising the complainant of the time limits and choice of forum under the law. At any time after the filing of the complaint, the Commission, by its attorneys, may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in the Superior Court, pending final disposition of the complaint, if the commission concludes such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
E.  The Commission shall promptly serve a copy of the complaint and a notice upon the respondent advising him of his procedural rights and obligations under the law, by certified mail, return receipt requested. The respondent may, in response to said notice, file a verified answer with the Commission not later than ten days after receipt of the notice of the complaint. 
F.

The investigation shall be commenced within thirty days after receipt of the complaint. 
G.  The Commission shall complete its investigation and issue a final investigative report consistent with Section 14.04.059 within one hundred days after receipt of the complaint unless impracticable, and if impracticable, shall notify the complainant and the respondent in writing and state the reasons for the delay. 
H.  Any conciliation agreement arising out of conciliation efforts by the Commission shall be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant and shall be approved by the Commission and shall be made public unless the complainant and the respondent otherwise agree and the Commission determines disclosure is not necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
I.  At the close of the investigation, the Commission shall issue a final investigative report. Said report shall conclude whether or not probable cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint. 
J.  If lack of probable cause is found, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint, notify the parties of its finding, and inform the complainant of his right to commence a private civil action in the Superior Court. Said action shall be commenced within ninety days from the date of the dismissal or within two years from the date of the violation alleged, whichever occurs later. The court shall be empowered to award the plaintiff actual and punitive damages; grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any temporary or permanent injunction, temporary restraining order or other order: and allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs as permitted under Section 14.04.053 of this code. 
K.  If probable cause is found, both the complainant and respondent shall be notified in writing. Either party may elect, within twenty days from receipt of the Commission's finding, to file a civil action in the Superior Court. 
1.  If a timely election is made by either party, the Commission shall immediately notify the office of the Attorney General, who shall file a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person within thirty days after a timely election is made. Any complainant may intervene as of right in said civil action. The Commission shall administratively close the case, without prejudice. 
2.  If a timely election is not made, the case shall proceed to a public hearing. No Commissioner participating in the aforementioned hearing shall have been involved in the prior investigation. The Massachusetts law of evidence shall apply at the Commissioner's hearing. At any such hearing before the Commission, all parties and witnesses shall have the right to be advised and represented by counsel at their own expense. The complainant shall be represented by the Executive Director of the Commission as prescribed by the Commission's Rules of Procedure. 
3.  Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Rules of Procedure which shall ensure that all parties are afforded due process of law. 
L.  The hearing Commissioners shall issue a report which lists findings of fact and conclusions of law within sixty days after the conclusion of the hearing. If the hearing Commissioners conclude that the charges of discriminatory conduct by the respondent cannot be substantiated, the case shall be dismissed with prejudice. 
M.  The decision of the hearing Commissioners is subject to review by the entire Commission. The review must be initiated within thirty days from the date of the decision or said decision becomes the final administrative decision. 
N.  The Commission shall make a final administrative disposition of the complaint within one year from the date of the receipt of the complaint, unless impracticable. If impracticable, it must notify the complainant and the respondent in writing and list the reasons for not doing so. 
(Ord. 1130 (part), 1992)  
14.04.060 - RemediesRelief sought and granted. 
A.  After a finding of probable cause is made, the Commission may file a petition in equity in the Superior Court seeking injunctive relief against the respondent. If justice so requires, the court shall be authorized to grant relief including: 
1.  Orders or decrees restraining the respondent from selling, renting, or otherwise making the real estate transaction unavailable to the complainant; 
2.  Any appropriate injunctive relief the court deems necessary to protect the rights of the complainant. 
B.  If the Commission, in the final administrative report of its decision, finds that any respondent committed any unlawful practice under this chapter, said Commission may: 
1.  Award to the complainant damages to reimburse him for expenses incurred including, but not limited to, moving, storage of furniture and personal effects, and alternative housing or space because of the respondent's unlawful acts. Damages for emotional distress may also be awarded to the complainant;

3.12 In addition to the districts established under Subsection 3.11, overlay districts may be
established from time to time. As specified elsewhere in this Ordinance, each overlay
district shall have special regulations which shall be applicable in lieu of or in addition to
the regularly applicable regulations for the base zoning district.
3.20 ZONING MAP
3.21 The boundaries of each of the said districts are hereby established as shown on the map
entitled, Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, or as hereafter amended, which map is
attached to and made a part of this Ordinance. The said Zoning Map and all boundaries,
notations, and other data shown thereon are made by this reference as much a part of
this Ordinance as if fully described and detailed herein. The said map shall be filed in the
custody of the City Clerk of Cambridge and may be examined by the public subject to
any reasonable regulations established by the City Clerk.
3.30 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
3.31 The boundaries between districts are shown on the Zoning Map. Where uncertainty
exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the map
accompanying and made a part of this Ordinance, the following rules shall apply:
3-4
a. Where the district boundary is a street, the boundary line shall be the centerline of
the street.
b. Where the boundary line is indicated approximately parallel to the street, it shall be
taken as parallel thereto and, unless otherwise indicated, one hundred feet distant
from the nearest street line. If there is any variance between the scaled distance
from the boundaries to the street line and the distance as marked in feet upon the
map, the latter shall govern.
c. Where the districts designated on the map are bounded by lot lines, the lot lines
shall be construed to be the boundary lines, unless the boundary lines are
otherwise indicated on the map.
3.32 Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot under single ownership at the time of
the effective date of this Ordinance, (6/29/81) the regulations for each zoning district shall
apply to portions of the lot within the respective districts except as provided in this
Subsection 3.32.
3.32.1 Where more than one-half the area of said lot is in a less restricted district, (either in
terms of the district's overall regulations or a single regulation) the Board of Zoning
Appeal may grant a special permit allowing any of the less restrictive dimensional
regulation(s) to extend up to twenty-five (25) feet into the more restricted district. Uses
not allowed in the more restricted districts shall not extend into the more restricted
districts.
3.32.2 Dwelling units and/or gross floor area allowed in the more restricted district, according to
the formulas specified in Subsection 5.27, may be located in the less restricted district,
but dwelling units or gross floor area allowed in the less restricted districted may be
located in that portion of the lot located in the more restricted district only to the extent
permitted in Section 3.321.

establishment.
n. A helipad or airport shall not be considered as an accessory use.
4.22 Accessory Apartments. The purpose of this Subsection 4.22 is to allow for the creation of
accessory apartments in all districts. Many large single and two-family homes are
underutilized. Alteration of these homes to provide additional dwelling units would be
prohibited in most cases due to the existing floor area ratio and/or lot area per dwelling
unit requirements of Subsection 5.31. Given contemporary life styles, housing needs and
energy and maintenance costs, it is beneficial to the City to allow greater flexibility in the
use of such dwellings without substantially altering the environmental quality of such
residential districts. This Subsection 4.22 gives the Board of Zoning appeal authority to
relax such requirements in certain instances as enumerated below.
4-4
4.22.1 In all districts the Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for alteration of a
single family or two-family, detached dwelling to provide one accessory apartment if the
following conditions are met:
1. The dwelling has not been substantially enlarged since built. The addition in the
aggregate of two hundred and fifty (250) square feet or more of gross floor area shall
be considered a substantial enlargement.
2. Prior to alteration the dwelling contains at least one thousand eight hundred (1,800)
square feet of gross floor area.
3. The lot on which such accessory apartment is located contains at least five thousand
(5,000) square feet of lot.
4. Such accessory apartment shall not occupy more than nine hundred (900) square
feet or thirty-five (35) percent of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling,
whichever is less, and shall not be located in a garage.
5. The owner(s) of the residence in which the accessory dwelling unit is created must
continue to occupy at least one of the dwelling units as their primary residence. Prior
to issuance of a building permit, the owner(s) must submit a notarized letter stating
that the owner will occupy one of the dwelling units on the premises as the owners
primary residence.
6. Any existing two-family home may be converted to a single family home with
accessory unit by right, without need for a Special Permit.
In granting a special permit the Board may impose such conditions, including
requirements for off street parking and limitations on other accessory uses of the
premises, as it may deem appropriate to avoid detriment to the neighborhood or to nearby
persons or property. The Board of Zoning Appeal shall evaluate each special permit
application which involves exterior changes with the appearance of and character of the
neighborhood and may require that there be no change or minimal change to any face of
a building oriented toward a public way or visible from a public way.
4.22.2 The requirement for an off street parking space specified in Article 6.000 shall not apply
for the addition of one accessory apartment in a single family or two-family, detached
dwelling in all districts. .
4.23 Offices in Residences. In a Residence C-2A, C-3, or C-3B district, offices for physicians
and dentists may be located on the first or second floor of a residential building where
such office space does not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross floor area of the building.
In a Residence C-3A district, up to forty (40) percent of the gross floor area of a
residential building may be devoted to business and professional offices, but not technical
offices.
4.24 Temporary Buildings and Uses. The Superintendent of Buildings may grant a permit for a
temporary building or use incidental to a building development, which does not comply
with the provisions of this Ordinance, where reasonably required for such development.
Such permit may be issued for an initial period of not more than one year, and in the case
of a building, only upon application accompanied by a bond and bill of sale to the City,
effective in case the building is not removed prior to the expiration of the permit. Permits
4-5
may be renewed by the Superintendent of Buildings for successive periods of not more
than one year each, not to exceed a total of three years.
4.25 Non Open Space Uses in Open Space Districts. The purpose of this section is to provide
for public notification and review of governmental and institutional nonopen space
development statutorily exempt from prohibition in designated Open Space Districts. All
uses in an Open Space District other than a park or recreation use permitted by
Subsection 4.33.f shall comply with the procedural requirements of this Subsection prior
to the issuance of any building or special permit, variance or other approval or before
conveyance of any lot within the district.
4.25.1 A report shall be submitted to the Planning Board and filed with the City Clerk by the
agency or other party proposing such non open space development or proposing to
convey a lot. This report shall include the following information, as appropriate:
(1) A map indicating the location and area of the land proposed for nonopen space
development or for conveyance.
(2) A description of the proposed development and future use of the area including
information concerning the proposed site plan, physical design, and user population.
(3) An analysis of alternative sites for the development outside of the district.
(4) Evaluation of the anticipated impacts of the development or property transfer on the
remainder of the open space district, upon the ability of alternative park and
recreation areas in the neighborhood and city to meet the needs served by the
affected open space district which would be displaced by the proposed action, and
upon other land uses in the neighborhood.
(5) Any other information reasonably determined pertinent by the Planning Board.
4.25.2 Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a report required by Section 4.25.1, the Planning
Board shall hold a public hearing concerning the proposed development or conveyance.
Notice for the hearing shall comply with the requirements of Section 11, Chapter 40A,
G.L.
4.25.3 The Planning Board shall prepare a report with recommendations concerning the
proposed development or conveyance, including conditions that should be attached to
such action. This report shall be filed with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the
public hearing required in Section 4.25.2. Filing of such a report shall satisfy the
requirements of this Section 4.25. Failure of the Board to file a report within thirty (30)
days of the public hearing shall obviate any further actions under this Section 4.25.
4.26 Multifamily Special Permit Applicability
4.26.1 The construction of a multifamily dwelling containing twelve (12) or more dwelling units or
of elderly oriented congregate housing containing twenty-four (24) or more separate living
spaces in a Residence C, Residence C-1, Residence C-1A, Office 1, Business A-1, or
Business A-3 district shall require a special permit granted by the Planning Board.
4.26.2 The construction of a multifamily dwelling or of elderly oriented congregate housing in a
Residence C, Residence C-1, Residence C-1A, Office 1, Business A-1 or Business A-3
district which contains less than twelve (12) dwelling units or twenty-four (24) dwelling
4-6
living spaces shall require a special permit if both of the following conditions pertain to the
development.
(1) another permit for a multifamily dwelling or elderly oriented congregate housing has
been granted within the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of
permit application for the lot on which the development would be located or on an
abutting lot;
(2) the development for which the permit is being sought would increase the total
number of dwelling units on said lot(s) to twelve (12) or more, the total number of
living spaces to twenty-four (24) or more, or the total number of dwelling units and
living spaces to eighteen (18) or more.
4.26.3 The construction of multifamily dwellings and elderly oriented congregate housing in
Industry A and A-2 districts, Industry B, B-1, and B-2 districts, and the Industry C district
shall require a special permit granted by the Planning Board where any one of the
following conditions exits:
1. The development exceeds fifty thousand (50,000) square feet of Gross Floor Area;
2. The lot area per dwelling unit proposed is less than one thousand, two hundred
(1,200) square feet in an Industry C district, six hundred (600) square feet in an
Industry A, or three hundred (300) square feet in an Industry A-2, Industry B or
Industry B-1 district; or
3. Twelve (12) or more dwelling units are proposed where any portion of the
development is located within one hundred (100) feet of a Residence A-1, A-2, B, C,
or C-1 district.
4.26.4 A special permit from the Planning Board shall be required for development of elderly
oriented housing if a building permit, special permit or variance application filed for
construction of elderly oriented housing on a lot on which a permit to demolish a dwelling
has been granted within the previous three (3) years and on which said dwelling was
demolished or will be demolished prior to construction of said elderly oriented housing.
4.27 Special Use Limitations in the Business B-1 and B-2 Districts.
4.27.1 In the Business B-1 and B-2 districts, the uses specified in Subsection 4.35 shall be
permitted provided that they occupy no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the
maximum gross floor area allowed on the lot. However, the gross floor area of any single
retail establishment shall not exceed twelve thousand (12,000) square feet.
4.27.2 In the Business B-1 district, the portion of any parcel within forty-five (45) feet of a front lot
line facing Green Street shall be limited to the following uses: (1) residential uses
permitted by Subsections 4.31 a, b, d, and g; (2) parking which is both covered and
enclosed and which is accessory to dwelling units located within said aforementioned
portion of the parcel; and (3) landscaped green space subject to the requirements of
Subsection 4.27.3; however, where more than fifty (50) percent of the area of said portion
of a lot is devoted to landscaped green space a special permit shall be secured from the
Planning Board. Development plans for parcels which face Green Street shall show how
such portion will be used in compliance with this Subsection 4.27.2. Completion of plans
4-7
for said forty-five (45) foot portion shall be required prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy for development on other portions of the parcel. It is the intention of this
Subsection 4.27.2 that the pattern of property ownership rights existing at the time of
adoption of these regulations not be altered in a way to circumvent the creation of a
residential or green space buffer next to Green Street. Therefore, for the purposes of this
Subsection 4.27.2, a parcel shall consist of one or more lots as defined in Article 2.000 or
parts of such lots which, at the time of the effective date of this Subsection 4.27.2 were

purchase and sales agreements, purchase options, lease agreement, or options, or
through some similar agreement or instrument.
4.27.3 Landscaped green space within the forty-five (45) foot portion of a lot described in
Subsection 4.27.2 shall be open to the sky and shall be located at an elevation within five
(5) feet of the grade level at the Green Street lot line. Such space shall include a
minimum of one three inch caliper tree for each nine hundred (900) square feet of area
within such landscaped portion. A suggested list of trees is contained in Section 11.16.4,
under 4b. In addition to the criteria listed in Subsection 10.40, the Planning Board shall
evaluate special permit applications with respect to the following: continuity with other
open spaces, relationship to other lots, and/or creative design features.
4.27.4 The Business B-1 and Business B-2 districts shall be considered areas of special
planning concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 11.42 shall be subject to
the development consultation procedures specified in Article 19.000.
4.28 Art/Craft Studio. The purpose of this Section 4.28 is to ensure that art/craft studios
located in Residence C and Office Districts will be compatible with other permitted uses,
particularly in residential neighborhoods.
4.28.1 The Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for the location of an art/craft
studio or group of studios in Residence C, C-1, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, C-3B and

of that normally occurring in the adjacent neighborhood.
c. no bulk storage of toxic or highly flammable materials shall occur.
d. the proposed studio use shall satisfy all applicable building, fire safety, and
health codes.
e. noise shall be restricted to levels customarily permitted in the districts as
regulated in General Ordinance #887 Regulations for the Control of
Noise, or as customarily produced by other permitted uses in the district,
whichever is less.
f. noxious odors, dust, and/or fumes shall be effectively disposed of and
confined to the premises to avoid air pollution and nuisance to the adjacent
neighborhood.

substantial reduction in the recreational and/or open space use, excluding parking
areas and roadways. Where the Board does find there will be a substantial reduction
in the recreational and/or open space use the special permit shall be granted upon
assurance by the City Manager that he will offset such reduction by increased
recreational and/or open space uses at another location, subject to necessary
appropriations.

4.50 INSTITUTIONAL USE REGULATIONS
4.51 Legal Authority. In accordance with Chapter 565 of the 1979 General Court, and as
amended by Chapter 387 of the Acts of 1980, the use of land for institutional purposes in
residentially zoned districts which require a lot of one thousand two hundred (1,200)
square feet or more per dwelling unit shall be governed by the provisions of this Section
4.50.
4.52 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 4.50 to protect lower density residential
neighborhoods from unlimited expansion of institutional activities, to reduce pressures for
conversion of the existing housing stock to nonresidential uses, to minimize the
development of activities which are different from and incompatible with activity patterns
customarily found in lower density residential neighborhoods and to provide a framework
for allowing those institutions which are compatible with residential neighborhoods to
locate and expand there. This Section 4.50 is intended to accomplish these purposes in
a manner consistent with the findings and objectives of the Community Development
Departments Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan (1981).
4.53 Approach. This Section 4.50 establishes special use regulations for institutional activities
in the Residence A-1, A-2, B, C and C-1 zoning districts. These regulations encompass
the full range of institutional uses. Each use is regulated based on its expected physical
impacts on nearby residences, on the existing or recent use of the lot or structure
proposed for such use, and on the location of the lot either within or outside of an area in
which there has already been extensive institutional development.
4.54 Institutional Overlay District. The designation Institutional Overlay District is hereby
established on the Zoning Map as provided for in Subsection 3.12. An Institutional
Overlay District delimits an area where there has been extensive contiguous development
of institutional use types subject to regulation under this Section 4.50. Institutional
Overlay Districts are defined in order to identify areas where prior development patterns
create a precedent for more flexible institutional use regulation than in areas where non
institutional uses predominate. The conditions regarding development of new or
expanded institutional uses under Subsections 4.55 and 4.56 are determined in part by
whether a lot is located inside or outside an Institutional Overlay District. The boundaries
of these districts are drawn based on several physical factors; consequently, for purposes
of definitional clarity, they encompass areas both inside and outside zoning districts
subject to use regulation under this Section 4.50. Regardless of the location of an
Institutional Overlay District boundary, the special institutional use regulations of this
Section 4.50 shall only apply within the Residence A-1, A-2, B, C and C-1 districts. The
following Institutional Overlay Districts are hereby established on the Zoning Map.
4.54.1 The Harvard, Radcliffe, Lesley District
4.54.2 The Episcopal Divinity School District.
4.54.3 The Observatory Hill District.
4.54.4 The Mount Auburn Hospital District
4.54.5 The Shady Hill School, and Buckingham, Browne, and Nichols School District.
4-28
4.54.6 The Matignon School District
4.54.7 The Cambridge Street Health Center District
4.54.8 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology District.
4.55 Existing Lot Status. The institutional use of land or structures for each category of
institutional activity in a Residence A-1, A-2, B, C and C-1 district shall be governed by the
Table of Institutional Use Regulations in Subsection 4.56. The institutional use regulation
in the table shall be the same in the aforementioned five (5) zoning districts, but shall
differ according to: (1) the applicable use category, (2) the location of the lot in relation to
the Institutional Overlay Districts, and (3) the status of the lot in relation to its existing or
recent use. If two or more of the lot status types listed below would pertain to the
proposed development of an institutional use, then the more restrictive designation
among the types of lot status for the use would apply. The column heading in Subsection
4.56 refers to the types of lot status listed in Subsection 4.55.1 and applies to institutional
development whether by conversion of an existing structure or lot or by new construction
or new use of a lot.
4.55.1 The Existing Lot Status pertaining to the proposed institutional development shall be
defined according to one of the following three types:
(1) A lot which contains a residential use listed in Subsection 4.31, or which is vacant
and which within the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the date of permit
application, but subsequent to March 23, 1980, contained such residential use;
(2) A lot which contains any use other than those residential and institutional uses listed
in Subsection 4.31 or 4.33, or which is vacant and did not within the twenty-four (24)
month period prior to the date of permit application, but subsequent to March 23,
1980, contain a use listed in Subsection 4.31 or 4.33; or
(3) A lot which contains an institutional use listed in Subsection 4.33, or which is vacant
and which within the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the date of permit
application, but subsequently to March 23, 1980, contained such institutional use.

libraries, museums, dining halls and service facilities including facilities listed in
Subsection 4.56c(4) which are not accessible to the general public.
2. Local government shall include all nonresidential facilities and activities of the City of
Cambridge, the Cambridge Housing Authority, Cambridge Redevelopment Authority
and their component agencies, but shall not include public schools.
3. This use designation shall include facilities for cultural and ethnic heritage
appreciation.
4. The Board of Zoning Appeal shall grant a special permit for this use only if the
applicant demonstrates that he will act to replace indefinitely the dwelling units
removed from the lot or converted to institutional use with an equivalent number of
units, not previously on the housing market, at another location or locations within the
4-31
City of Cambridge, before the units are removed or converted, and only if the
applicant adequately provides at his own expense for the relocation of the occupants
of the existing units to comparable units within the City of Cambridge. In every case,
this replacement housing shall include units suitable for and available to low and
moderate income households in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the total
number of units to be replaced. The remaining replacement units shall be
comparable to the units removed. Comparability shall be determined by dwelling unit
mix in terms of number of bedrooms, special facilities (such as handicapped access
or common areas), amenities, including those existing in the surrounding
neighborhood and range of price/rent levels. The Board of Zoning Appeal may
require that the applicant submit whatever evidence it deems necessary to determine
that the replacement units will be comparable and the applicant is bound to provide
such units. Otherwise the special permit will not be issued. Replacement units shall
be available for occupancy before the existing dwelling units are removed or
converted and shall remain available as low and moderate income and comparable
units unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeal. No building or
demolition permit for the proposed institutional development shall be issued until the
replacement units are available for occupancy and the occupants of the existing units
have been relocated.
5. This use is allowed as of right if the pre-existing institutional use of the lot is in the
same use table category in Subsection 4.56, otherwise a special permit from the
Board of Zoning Appeal shall be required. Such special permit shall be granted only
if the Board determines that the use will have fewer adverse impacts on the
neighborhood than the pre-existing institutional use. In making this determination,
the Board shall consider and comment on the physical attributes of the use, including
those evaluated in the Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan. The Board
may require the applicant to submit whatever documentation it deems necessary, to
assist it in making said determination.
6. This use may be allowed upon issuance of a special permit by the Board of Zoning
Appeal if the pre-existing institutional use of the lot is in the same use table category
in Subsection 4.56 or if the Board determines that the use will have fewer adverse
impacts on the neighborhood than the pre-existing institutional use. In making this
determination, the Board shall consider and comment on the physical attributes of
the use, including those evaluated in the Cambridge Institutional Growth
Management Plan. The Board may require the applicant to submit whatever
documentation it deems necessary to assist it in making said determination.
7. Subject to the provision of Section 11.20.
8. Any dimensional or other relief from the provisions of this Ordinance required to
construct or locate a municipal library use shall be permitted by grant of a special
permit from the Planning Board. In granting such a special permit, where the library
is proposed to be located within an Open Space zoning district, the Planning Board
shall, in addition to the criteria set forth in Section 10.43, find that there will be no
substantial reduction in the recreational and/or open space use, excluding parking
areas and roadways. Where the Board does find there will be a substantial reduction
in the recreational and/or open space use the special permit shall be granted upon
4-32
assurance by the City Manager that he will offset such reduction by increased
recreational and/or open space uses at another location, subject to necessary
appropriations.
4.57 Special Permit Criteria. The Board of Zoning Appeal shall grant a special permit for a use
in Subsection 4.56 only if it determines that the benefits of the proposed use at that
location will outweigh it detriments. In addition to any particular determinations which
must be made under footnotes 4, 5, or 6 of said Subsection and Subsection 10.43,
Special Permit Criteria, the Board shall consider and address the following factors as
appropriate:
Benefits
1. The building design or site plan would be compatible with the neighborhood.
2. The institution would be accessible to or primarily oriented toward neighborhood
residents.
3. The institution would fulfill an identified neighborhood need.
4. The institution would fulfill an identified citywide need.
5. Institutional use would be particularly appropriate on the lot given previous use of the
lot.
6. Institutional use would be particularly appropriate on the lot given institutional use of
adjacent or nearby lots.
7. Residential development would not be feasible or reasonably practical on the site.
8. The proposed institutional use would create a stronger buffer or a more gentle
transition between residential and nonresidential areas.
9. The proposed institutional use would result in a net improvement to the neighborhood
by being more compatible than the previous use of the lot.
Detriments
1. Development of the institutional use would substantially contravene the objectives of
the Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan.
2. The intensity of the institutional use would be substantially greater than the use
intensity of residences in the neighborhood, including traffic, building bulk, parking
demands, etc.
3. The activity patterns, including pedestrian and vehicle travel to and from the
institution would differ from existing neighborhood activity patterns so as to adversely
impact the neighborhood.
4. Development of an institutional use would eliminate existing dwelling units.
5. Development of an institutional use would eliminate nonresidential services or
activities which are beneficial to the neighborhood.
4.58 Special Permit Procedures. Applications for a special permit from the Board of Zoning
Appeal under Subsection 4.56 shall be subject to the general procedural requirements
specified in Article 19.000.

(24) months if the lot or structures are vacant.
5. A written description of the proposed use of the lot including the intensity of use,
expected activity patterns, and probable users.
6. A statement of how the anticipated physical attributes of the use will be similar to or
different from those predicted for that category of use generally in the Cambridge
Institutional Growth Management Plan.
7. If germane to the proposal, a plan for replacing dwelling units to be displaced by the
institutional use as required by footnote 4 of Subsection 4.56.
8. A list of any zoning violations which would customarily necessitate variances from the
requirements of this Ordinance.
4.58.2 No application shall be accepted by the Board of Zoning Appeal until all of the information
required in this Subsection 4.57 is submitted. Any changes in the application following
submittal, other than those requested by the Board of Zoning Appeal, or its agent, shall
require resubmittal of an application for a special permit. During the course of the special

5.30 DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.40 TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS
5.50 SPECIAL DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.10 GENERAL REGULATIONS
5.11 No building or structure shall be built nor shall any existing building or structure be
enlarged which does not conform to the regulations as to maximum ratio of floor area
and lot areas, minimum lot sizes, minimum lot area for each dwelling unit or equivalent,
minimum lot width, minimum dimensions of front, side and rear yards and maximum
height of structures, in the several districts as set forth in Article 5.000, Section 5.30
except as hereinafter provided and except in the Cambridge Center MXD District which
shall be governed by the requirements of Section 14.30.
5.12 The lot or yard areas required for any new building or use may not include any part of a
lot that is required by any other building or used to comply with any requirements of
this Ordinance, nor may these areas include any property of which the ownership has
been transferred subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance if such property
was a part of the area required for compliance with the dimensional requirements
applicable to the lot from which such transfer was made.
5.13 In the case of multiple buildings on a lot, the minimum distance between such buildings
shall not be less than the sum of the heights of the buildings divided by six, or ten feet,
whichever is greater. In determining compliance with this section, portions of buildings
exempted by Section 5.23 shall not be counted in computing building height.
5.14 For residential uses permitted in Residence A, B, C, and Office districts which are not
divided into dwelling units, each one thousand square feet of gross floor area of the
building shall be considered equivalent to one dwelling unit for purposes of computing
minimum lot area.
5.15 No lot or development parcel shall be changed in size, shape, or ownership so that the
dimensional requirements or off street parking and loading requirements prescribed in
this Ordinance are no longer satisfied. This paragraph shall not apply where a portion
of the lot or development parcel is acquired for a public purpose. This paragraph shall
not apply to townhouse development, as governed by Section 11.10.
5.20 STANDARDS FOR DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.21 Lot area and width
5.21.1 On lots of less than the required area for the district in which they are located and
which have been duly recorded by plan or deed with the Registry of Deeds before the
date of the first passage of the applicable provisions of this or any prior Ordinance the
5-2
minimum lot size and lot width regulations need not apply, but the floor area ratio and
the minimum lot area regulations for each dwelling unit shall be applicable. In case of
such lots of less than the required width the sum of the two required side yards need
not be more than thirty (30) percent of the lot width, except that each side yard shall be
a minimum of seven feet, six inches (7 6).
5.21.2 No building shall be erected on a lot which does not have at least twenty (20) feet of
frontage on a street. This paragraph does not apply to townhouse developments. This
requirement shall not be applicable in the Cambridge Center MXD District.
5.22 Private Open Space
5.22.1 Private open space shall be provided on every lot used for residential purposes except
for those in the Cambridge Center MXD District, and shall be a percentage of the lot
area as set forth in Section 5.31. An area designated as private open space must
have both a width and a length of at least fifteen (15) feet, except for balconies, and
may not have a slope greater than ten (10) percent. With the exception of balcony
areas, private open space shall be accessible to all occupants of a building; not less
than one half of the required private open space shall be provided at ground level or
within ten (10) feet of the level of the lowest floor used for residential purposes. Areas
at other levels, such as balconies, decks, and roofs, of garages and buildings, which
are accessible to all occupants of buildings, which are not used as walkways or
corridors, and which have both a width and a length of at least six (6) feet and a
minimum area of seventy-two (72) square feet, may be calculated as private open
space, not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total private open space.
5.22.2 Where nonresidential and residential uses are mixed in a building, the required
minimum private open space for residential use shall be calculated in relation to the
portion of the lot which the residential floor area is to the total floor area in the building.
5.22.3 Special Requirements in Residence A-1, A-2, B, C, and C-1
At least fifty (50) percent of the required Private open space in these districts shall
meet all of the requirements of Section 5.22.1 above. At least fifty (50) percent of the
required Private open space shall meet the definition of Permeable Open Space and
shall not be subject to the dimensional limitations of Section 5.22.1 as applied to
Private open space.
5.23 Height Exceptions. The provisions of this Ordinance governing the height of buildings
and structures in all districts shall generally not apply to (a) chimneys, water towers, air
conditioning equipment, elevator bulkheads, skylights, ventilators and other necessary
features appurtenant to buildings which are usually carried above roofs and are not used
for human occupancy, (b) to domes, towers, or spires above buildings if such features are
not used for human occupancy and occupy less than ten (10) percent of the lot area, (c)
to wireless or broadcasting towers and other like unenclosed structures which occupy less
than ten (10) percent of the lot area, (d) to Wind Turbines, subject to the requirements
and limitations set forth in Section 22.70 and (e) to elements of a Solar Energy System,
5-3
as defined in Section 22.60 of this Zoning Ordinance, that would ordinarily be located on a
rooftop where they would have direct exposure to sunlight.
However, building elements enumerated in (a) above shall be limited in height where they
are placed on a building located in a non-residential district, which district abuts a
Residence A-1, A-2, B, C, C-1, C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B district. In these instances the
following height limitations shall apply to those building elements:
1. The elements must be below one or more forty-five (45) degree bulk control planes.
Each bulk control plane shall begin, in the vertical dimension, at the maximum height
limit permitted in the non-residential zoning district. In the horizontal dimension, the
plane shall begin at the residential/non-residential zoning district line: however, where
that line lies within a street, the plane shall begin at the front lot line, located nearest
the zoning district line, of the lots on which the building is sited. Thereafter the bulk
control plane shall rise from its beginning over the non-residential zoning district.
(See illustrative figure 5.23)
2. The limitations in Paragraph 1 above may be waived by special permit from the
Planning Board upon a finding by the Board that the additional height is necessary. In
making that determination the Planning Board shall consider the special and unique
requirements of the use that the elements are serving, any special constraints
imposed by the site upon which the building is located, the nature and character of
development in the adjacent residential district, and the extent to which successful
efforts are made to minimize the visual and acoustical impact of the elements on
neighbors.
5.24 Yards
5.24.1 Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky and unobstructed. Awnings,
arbors, fences, flagpoles, recreational and laundry drying equipment and similar
objects shall not be considered obstructions when located within a required yard.
Objects or structures intended exclusively for bicycle parking meeting the requirements
of Article 6.000, which may be uncovered, partially covered or fully enclosed, shall not
be considered obstructions provided that such objects or structures are not used for
motor vehicle parking, general storage or any other use, and further provided that any
such structure exceeding six feet (6) in height conforms to the requirements for an
accessory building in Section 4.21. In addition, objects or equipment located in a
required yard that are necessary for or appurtenant to a Public Bicycle-Sharing Station
shall not be considered obstructions. Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes for
emergency use only are permitted to encroach on yard areas.
5.24.2 Projecting eaves, chimneys, bay windows, balconies, open fire escapes and like
projections which do not project more than three and one half (3 1/2) feet and which
are part of a building not more than thirty-five (35) feet in height, and unenclosed steps,
unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet beyond the
line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above the average level
of the adjoining ground, may extend beyond the minimum yard regulations otherwise
provided for the district in which the structure is built.
5-4
5.24.3 On lots abutting streets on more than one side, the front yard requirements of each of
the abutting streets shall apply regardless of designated front lot lines. Any remaining
sides shall be subject to side yard requirements.
5.24.4 Measurements for minimum yards which are determined by formula shall be made in
the following manner:
(1) H is the height of the building. L is the length of the wall measured parallel to
the corresponding lot or street line. The front yard is measured from the street line, or
building line where such has been established, except where otherwise indicated
herein. For buildings of forty (40) feet or less in height the denominator in the yard
formulas in the Tables in Section 5.30 may be increased by two subject to the
minimum yard requirements set forth in footnotes a, b and c of Tables 5-1 and 5-2.
(2) Where a building consists of various roof levels an average height, or H, may be
used in the required yard formula. Average height is determined by adding the
products of the height of each roof level facing the given lot line, (H1, H2, etc.) times
the length of each roof level (L1, L2, etc.) and dividing the sum by the sum of the length
of the levels (L1, L2, etc.) (see formula below)
AVERAGE HEIGHT =
(H1 x L1) + (H2 x L2)
L1 + L2
(3) Where a building presents a variety of vertical planes to any given lot or street
line, no plane shall be closer to the street or building line or lot line than permitted by
the application to such plane of the appropriate formula in the tables of dimensional
requirements in Section 5.30. For all planes set forward of the setback line required by
said tables for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane, other planes
must be set behind the setback line so calculated. The result shall be that the sum of
the products of the setback required for each plane times the facing area of each plane
respectively shall be at least as great as the product of the setback required by the
appropriate table for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane times
the facing area of the building if viewed as a single plane. (see illustration below):
The product of (setback1 x facing area1) + (setback2 x facing area2)
MUST EQUAL OR EXCEED the product of (single plane setback) x
(single plane facing area)
5.25 FAR Exceptions for Parking and Loading Facilities
5.25.1 Loading Facilities. Areas used for off-street loading purposes shall be exempt from the
requirements as to Floor Area Ratio but shall conform to all other requirements of the
district in which it is located.
5.25.2 Parking Facilities in Structures. The floor area of an underground parking garage and the
floor area of the underground portion of a structure devoted in whole or in part to parking
automobiles, shall not be counted as Gross Floor Area and shall be exempt from the
requirements as to floor area but shall conform to all other requirements of the district in
5-5
which it is located. All other parking in structures shall be subject to the requirements as
to Floor Area Ratio.
5.25.21 Area of Parking Facility. For the purposes of this Section 5.25 the area of parking in a
structure shall include all parking spaces, access drives, aisles and other elements of the
parking facility and shall include any portion of a parking facility located at grade beneath
a building but not otherwise enclosed.
5.25.22 Definition of Underground. For the purposes of this Section 5.25 only, underground 
shall mean either of the following:
(1) The location of the entire parking facility below the finished grade of the ground
abutting the structure, or the underground portion thereof, which grade is maintained
naturally without any structural support. No more than two access drives, which in
combination total no more than 30 feet in width, shall be permitted to be above the
finished grade and still be considered to be located underground.
(2) The location of a portion of the facility above finished grade to the following extent:
(1) the mean height of that portion of the parking facility above finished grade around
the entire perimeter of the facility does not exceed four (4) feet, which grade is
maintained naturally without any structural support (in no case, however, shall the
height above mean grade for that portion of the facility facing a public street exceed
four feet), and (2) the roof or top of the facility shall be either set beneath other, nonparking
facility portions of the structure, landscaped or otherwise finished to serve as
a pedestrian plaza, open space amenity, recreation area or pedestrian circulation.
The height above mean grade shall be measured to the roof of the facility, or to the
ceiling should the facility be set entirely below other non-parking elements of a
building.
5.25.3 Exemption for Existing Parking Facilities. Structured parking facilities in existence on or
before September 15, 2000, or constructed and occupied at a later date pursuant to a
building or special permit in conformance with all provisions of Chapter 40A issued prior
to the effective date of the provisions of this Section 5.25, shall not be subject to the
requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.
5.25.4 Exceptions to the Provisions of this Section 5.25
5.25.41 Exemption for Residential Parking Spaces. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.25.2 above, the following structured parking located above ground, accessory to a
residential use, shall not be calculated as part of the Gross Floor Area on the lot:
(1) One parking space located within a townhouse unit or a one, two or three family
dwelling.
(2) A freestanding parking structure containing no more than one parking space per
dwelling unit up to a maximum of three parking spaces on a lot containing a one,
two or three family dwelling.
(3) One parking space per dwelling unit, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) spaces, for
multifamily dwellings.
5-6
5.25.42 Where an above ground parking facility in a structure is proposed to be constructed (a) in
the 100-year flood plain, identified as the Zone A flood hazard area (See Section 11.70),
or as determined by credible evidence and calculations from a registered professional
engineer or (b) on a contaminated site that is listed by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (310 CMR 40.00)
with a Release Tracking Number and has been tier classified, the Planning Board may
grant a special permit to waive the limitations of this Section 5.25 so that the parking
facility is not subject to the requirements in this Ordinance as to Floor Area Ratio provided
only the minimum number of parking spaces required for the uses on the site are
provided. In granting such a special permit, the Planning Board shall find the following:
(1) Where in a flood hazard area, the construction of a parking facility
underground is (a) not technically feasible due to the requirements of the
Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. ch. 131, s.40, (b) would require
construction that would violate requirements or limitations of the Massachusetts
Wetlands Protection Act, (c) would, in the view of the Cambridge Conservation
Commission, seriously compromise the wetlands protection objectives of the
Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act), and (d) would result in costs of
construction that are significantly greater than would otherwise be typical for the
location were it not in a flood hazard area; or
(2) Where the site is contaminated, the construction of a parking facility
underground (a) would, in the opinion of a Licensed Site Professional, pose
significant risks to public health or the environment through disturbance of
hazardous materials and could not be reasonably mitigated in accordance with
state and federal regulations, (b) require construction that is prohibited by state or
federal regulations related to hazardous wastes, and (c) would result in costs of
construction that would render the project financially unfeasible; and
(3) The above ground facility is designed so as to reduce its actual or perceived
bulk through, among other possible techniques, limiting the number of parking
spaces it contains, placement of portions of the facility below grade where
feasible, or its location relative to actively occupied portions of the construction.
Construction above grade is discouraged that would increase the amount of
impervious area on the lot.
5.26 Conversion of Dwellings. No new dwelling unit created by the conversion of an existing
dwelling into a greater number of units or by addition or enlargement of an existing dwelling
shall be permitted unless the requirements of minimum lot area for each dwelling unit,
maximum ratio of floor area to lot area, private open space and off street parking are
satisfied for all dwelling units (in existence and proposed) in the dwelling after the
conversion or enlargement.
5.27 Calculation for lot in two or more zoning districts. The maximum residential density (lot area
per dwelling unit) and gross floor area allowed on lots located in two or more zoning districts
shall be calculated using the formulas specified in this Subsection 5.27.
5-7
5.27.1 The total number of dwelling units allowed shall be the sum of the total dwelling units
allowed in each district, determined by adding the lot area in each district divided by
the minimum lot area per dwelling unit for each district.
Max # dwelling units = Lot area in district 1
district 1 min. lot area/du + Lot area in district 2
district 2 min. lot area/du
Where the computation of the total number of dwelling units allowed in each district
results in two fractional numbers and where the sum of the resulting remainders from
both districts equals or exceeds one, an additional unit shall be permitted.
5.27.2 The maximum gross floor area shall be the sum of the total allowed gross floor area in
each district, determined by adding the lot area in each district multiplied by the
maximum allowed floor area ratio (FAR) for each district.
Maximum Gross Floor Area = (Lot area in district 1 x district 1 FAR) +
(Lot area in district 2 x district 2 FAR)
5.28 Special Dimensional Standards Applicable to Dwellings
5.28.1 Dwellings in Non Residential Districts. A dwelling shall be subject to the dimensional
standards generally applicable in the district set forth in the Tables of Dimensional
Requirements in Section 5.30, except as provided for below.
a. A dwelling in a Business A district shall be subject to the same dimensional
requirements and other restrictions as a dwelling in a Residence C-2B district, except that
the height limitation on lots abutting Hampshire Street shall be sixty-five (65) feet.
b. A dwelling in a Business A-1 district shall be subject to the same dimensional
requirements and other restrictions as a dwelling in a Residence C-1 district.
c. A dwelling in a Business B district shall be subject to the same dimensional
requirements and other restrictions as a dwelling in a Residence C-3 district.
5.28.2 Conversion of Non Residential Structures to Residential Use
Where it is proposed to convert an existing principal use structure, designed and built for
non residential use, to residential use (excluding Transient Accommodations and Trailer
Park or Mobile Home Park listed in Section 4.31 (i-j)), the dimensional standards
generally applicable in the district as set forth in the Tables of Dimensional Requirements
in Section 5.30 and other applicable regulations in this Ordinance, including permitted
uses, Section 4.30  Table of Use Regulations, shall apply. However, where some or all
of those requirements cannot be met, including any use, dimensional or procedural
requirement that may apply in the base district, the following provisions shall apply to such
conversion after issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board. The provisions in this
Section 5.28.2 shall apply in all zoning districts with the exception of districts with an Open
Space designation.
5-8
Intent of this Section:
(a) To allow the economic reuse of buildings that may be substantially out of compliance
with the dimensional requirements of the zoning district within which they are located,
especially as they are converted to residential use.
(b) To encourage the preservation of buildings of historic or cultural significance by
providing opportunities for reuse of the structures.
(c) To establish a framework of development standards and criteria within which existing
non-residential buildings that are out of scale and character with surrounding
residential uses can be converted to housing of an appropriate style and density while
limiting potential negative impacts on neighbors.
5.28.20 Allowed Uses
The Planning Board may permit uses not otherwise allowed in the base zoning district,
subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(a) The permitted uses shall be limited to the following:
(1) All residential uses listed in Section 4.31 (a-h), but specifically excluding
Transient Accommodations and Trailer Park or Mobile Home Park listed in
Section 4.31 (i-j).
(2) The following institutional uses: Religious uses (4.33.a); Public or non-profit
educational uses (4.33.b.1); Private preschool, day care, kindergarten (4.33.b2);
Local government or other government facility (4.33.f, 4.33.g); Private museum,
library, non-commercial gallery (4.33.h.2).
(3) The following office uses: Office of an accountant, attorney, or other non-medical
professional (4.34.b); Real estate, insurance or other agency office (4.34.c);
General office use (4.34.d).
(4) Any uses allowed as accessory uses to the permitted principal uses.
(b) All permitted non-residential uses shall be limited to the ground floor or basement of
the building. The Planning Board may permit non-residential uses to occupy other
floors of the building only after determining that the location and design of such
spaces, including access and egress, will not impact the privacy or security of
residential occupants. However, the total floor area occupied by non-residential uses
shall not exceed the floor area of the ground floor and basement.
(c) The Planning Board shall determine that any proposed non-residential uses are
generally compatible with residential uses in the area, including the dwelling units
located within the same building, and will not cause harm or nuisance to surrounding
uses.
5-9
(d) The Planning Board shall determine that by permitting non-residential uses, there will
be a compensating reduction in the number of dwelling units that would otherwise be
permitted, and that the proposed non-residential uses will balance the potential
adverse impacts of additional residential units, such as demand for nighttime parking.
5.28.21 Gross Floor Area
The Gross Floor Area permitted shall be that which is the result of the application of the
FAR permitted in the district in which the structure is located, or the existing Gross Floor
Area of the structure itself, whichever is greater. However, the Planning Board may permit
additional Gross Floor Area to be added to the non residential structure without limit
provided all construction creating additional Gross Floor Area occurs within the physical
limits of the existing structure. Where it is proposed to add Gross Floor Area above what
would normally be allowed in the zoning district, the Planning Board shall determine that
such additional floor area is necessary to accommodate a reasonable arrangement and
layout of residential units within the existing structure.
If Gross Floor Area is added to an existing structure such that the resulting Gross Floor
Area is greater than twice what would be allowed under normal zoning district regulations
(including the Inclusionary Housing provisions of Section 11.200 if applicable), then half
the amount of Gross Floor Area added to the existing structure such that it exceeds twice
the normal district limit shall be deducted from the total Gross Floor Area of the structure
for the purpose of calculating the maximum permissible number of dwelling units under
Subsection 5.28.22 below.
For projects of at least 30,000 square feet or twenty (20) dwelling units for which the total
Gross Floor Area is greater than twice what would be allowed under normal zoning district
regulations (including the Inclusionary Housing provisions of Section 11.200 if applicable),
no more than seventy percent (70%) of the projects total Gross Floor Area shall be
occupied by living space within private dwelling units, and the remaining Gross Floor Area
shall be occupied by common areas such as hallways, stairways, lobbies,
fitness/recreational spaces, common storage areas, above-grade parking facilities,
laundry or other resident services, or approved non-residential uses.
5.28.22 Dwelling Units
The number of dwelling units permitted shall be the number of dwelling units allowed
under normal zoning district regulations (including the Inclusionary Housing provisions of
Section 11.200 if applicable).
However, the Planning Board may permit a greater number of dwelling units, with the
maximum permissible number of units determined by dividing the Gross Floor Area of the
structure as permitted in Section 5.28.21 above, after subtracting any Gross Floor Area
occupied exclusively by non-residential uses as permitted under Section 5.28.20, by
1,100 square feet for the first ten (10) units and by 1,900 square feet for any additional
units.
5-10
If a portion of the dwelling units meet the definition of Elderly Oriented Housing
(notwithstanding the number of such units within the building), the Planning Board may
permit the number of units to exceed the allowed maximum only for the specific purpose
of accommodating such units, which may be smaller than conventional housing units.
5.28.23 Yard Requirements
The required yards shall be those of the structure existing at the time of the conversion to
residential use. However, any construction occurring outside the limits of the existing
structure shall be subject to the yard requirements of the district in which the structure is
located.
5.28.24 Maximum Height
The maximum height shall be that height permitted in the district in which the structure is
located, or the building height, whichever is greater. However, any construction that
occurs outside the existing limits of the structure, other than construction exempt from the
height limit as set forth in Section 5.23, shall be subject to the maximum height limit of the
district in which the structure is located.
5.28.25 Private Open Space Requirements
The Private open space requirement shall be that required in the district in which the
structure is located, except as modified herein.
The dimensional and locational limitations for Private open space set forth in Section 5.22
shall not apply; any combination of at-grade private open space and decks and balconies
at other levels shall be permitted as shall walks intended for non vehicular use. However,
in every case where those requirements of Section 5.22 waived by this Paragraph (a) are
not met, all portions of the surface of the lot shall be Green Area as defined in Article
2.000 that are (1) not covered by the building or (2) devoted to the minimum area
necessary to provide at grade, conforming parking spaces and the minimum necessary
circulation and driveways for no more than one parking space per dwelling unit. The
amount of Private open space required may be reduced by the Planning Board should the
Board find that full compliance cannot reasonably be expected given the existing
development of the lot and the provision of parking necessary to serve the dwelling units.
However, where open space requirements are not met, the Applicant shall explore the
use of portions of the interior of the building to provide recreational opportunities not
possible on the exterior.
5.28.26 Conforming Additions
Conforming additions to such non-residential structures shall be permitted without
reference to the limitations set forth in Section 8.22 for such additions to non-conforming
structures.
5-11
5.28.27 Required Parking
Off-street parking shall be provided as required in the Schedule of Parking and Loading
Requirements, Section 6.36. In instances where 6.36 does not apply due to the proposed
use not being allowed in the base zoning district, required off-street parking for approved
residential uses shall be provided at a rate of one space per dwelling unit, and required
off-street parking for non-residential uses shall be determined by the Planning Board after
reviewing the requirements for that use within other zoning districts.
5.28.28 Criteria for Approval of a Special Permit
In acting upon this special permit, the Planning Board shall consider the standards and
criteria set forth in Sections 10.43, 10.47 and 10.47.1 of this Ordinance in addition to the
following review standards.
5.28.28.1 Criteria Applicable to All Projects
(a) Provision of Parking. Where it is proposed to add dwelling units above the limits
established in the base zoning regulations, the Board shall evaluate the impact of
increased numbers of dwelling units above that normally permitted in the district on
the demand for on-street parking by residents and visitors to the proposed building,
particularly in neighborhoods where off street parking is limited.
In reaching a determination, the Board may require that the Applicant provide
elements of a Parking Analysis as set forth in Section 6.35.3 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Where a project is subject to additional criteria as specified in Section 5.28.28.2
below, a Parking Analysis shall be required to be included with the Special Permit
Application.
(b) Privacy Considerations. Where significant variations from the normally required
dimensional standards for the district are proposed, the Board shall evaluate the
impact on residential neighbors of the new housing use and any other proposed use
as it may affect privacy. The location and size of windows, screening elements,
decks, entries, security and other lighting, and other aspects of the design, including
the distribution of functions within the building, shall be reviewed in order to assure
the maintenance of reasonable levels of privacy for abutters. In reviewing a proposed
development plan, the Board shall consider, among other factors, the potential
negative impacts of the new activity on abutters as a result of the location, orientation,
and use of the structure(s) and its yards as proposed.
(c) Reduction in Private Open Space. Where it is proposed to reduce the amount of onsite
Private Open Space below that required in the applicable district, the Board shall
evaluate the proposal in light of the following:
(1) The extent to which screening and buffering from neighbors will be accomplished
(2) The quality and viability of the proposed open spaces as they are designed
(3) The tradeoff in benefits and negative impacts of the loss of green space in order
to provide the required amount of parking, including consideration of the feasibility
5-12
of alternate parking arrangements that might produce additional green area, such
as placing some or all parking within the structure
(4) The availability of common recreational spaces within the building to compensate
for the loss of usable outdoor open space
(d) Community Outreach. The Planning Board shall consider what reasonable efforts
have been made to address concerns raised by abutters and neighbors to the project
site. An applicant seeking a special permit under this Section 5.28.2 shall solicit input
from affected neighbors before submitting a special permit application. The
application shall include a report on all outreach conducted and meetings held, shall
describe the issues raised by community members, and shall describe how the
proposal responds to those issues.
5.28.28.2 Additional Criteria Applicable to Larger Projects
Where the proposed project includes more than 10,000 Gross Square Feet or more than
ten (10) dwelling units, and the proposed Gross Floor Area or number of dwelling units is
above the maximum allowed under base zoning regulations, the Board shall evaluate the
proposal in light of the following:
(a) The implications of the size or number of additional dwelling units on the anticipated
demand for parking. In order to assist the Planning Board in evaluating parking
impacts, an applicant for a special permit shall be required to submit a Parking
Analysis, as set forth in Section 6.35.3 of the Zoning Ordinance, as part of the special
permit application.
(b) The appropriateness of the proposed layout of floor space within the building for a
multifamily residential use, with attention to the typical range of unit sizes and types
that would be expected for housing in the neighborhood. Considerations may include
the suitability of proposed unit configurations for a variety of households, the extent to
which unusual unit sizes or shapes may impact parking or overall quality of life for
neighbors, and the availability of customary amenities for residents such as storage,
utilities, common rooms and recreational facilities.
(c) The potential mitigating effects of the proposed occupancy of dwelling units. For
instance, units designed for elderly residents or live/work spaces for professionals or
artists may provide desirable housing options for Cambridge residents with fewer
adverse impacts on parking or neighborhood character.

5.30 DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.30.1 Rules for Applying Certain Provisions of the Tables of Dimensional Requirements
5.30.11 FAR and Height. Where two numbers appear in Column (1)  Maximum Ratio of Floor
Area to Lot Area and Column (6) Maximum Height in Feet, the first number shall apply to
all permitted uses in the district except Residential Uses, Section 4.31 a-h, and Dormitory
(but excluding resident fraternity or sorority) Uses, Section 4.33 b(7), both of which shall
be governed by the second number.
5.30.12 Calculation of Permitted Gross Floor Area on a Lot
Where two numbers regulate the permitted FAR on a lot, the Gross Floor Area of any
uses proposed on the lot shall be determined by the following formula:
Gross Floor Area Permitted = [(A x FAR1) x Lot Area] + [(B x FAR2) x Lot Area]
Where A equals the percentage of Gross Floor Area in the building to be used for
nonresidential use(s), and
Where B equals the percentage of Gross Floor Area in the building to be used for
residential and dormitory use(s), and
Where A + B = 100% (or 1.0) or less, and
FAR1 equals permitted FAR for nonresidential uses, and
FAR2 equals permitted FAR for residential and dormitory uses.

2. Footnotes
(a) Measured from the centerline of the street, but in no case may a building be nearer
the street than ten (10) feet.
(b) Measured from the centerline of the street, but in no case may a building be nearer
the street line than five (5) feet
(c) In no case may a building be nearer the rear lot line than twenty (20) feet in
Residence C-2, C-2B, C-2A, C-3, C-3A, C-3B districts. In Residence C and C-1
districts, no building may be nearer the rear lot line than twenty (20) feet plus one
additional foot of rear yard for each four feet that the depth of the lot exceeds 100
feet, up to a maximum of thirty (30) feet. In Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts, no
5-15
building may be nearer the rear lot line than twenty-five (25) feet plus one additional
foot of rear yard for each four feet that the depth of the lot exceeds one hundred
(100) feet, up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet. For purposes of this Footnote C,
the lot depth shall be that distance measured along a line perpendicular to the front
lot line and extending to that point on the rear lot line most distant from the front lot
line.
(d) The maximum ratio of floor area to lot area for buildings containing principal uses
specified in Section 4.34 shall not exceed 1.25.
(e) For buildings subject to the floor area ratio limitation specified in footnote (d) above,
the minimum front yards may be reduced to no less than five (5) feet measured from
the street line.
(f) For buildings subject to the floor area ratio limitation specified in footnote (d) above,
the minimum side yards may be reduced to no less than five (5) feet measured from
the street line.
(g) In no case may a building on any lot which abuts or is separated only by a public or
private way from a Residence A-1 and A-2, B, C, C-1, C-2, or C-2B district be nearer
the street line or side line of the lot than the minimum front and side yard
requirements for the residential district which said lot abuts or from which it is
separated by a way. However, such increased setback requirements shall only
apply to any part of a building which is located within one hundred and twenty five
(125) feet of a Residence A-1, A-2, B, C, C-1, C-2, or C-2B district.
(h) The minimum ratio of private open space to lot area required for a lot which abuts/or
is separated only by a public or private way from a Residence A-1, A-2, B, C, C-1, C-
2 or C-2B district shall be equal to the amount of private open space required in the
residential district which said lot abuts or from which it is separated by a way.
(i) The dimensional requirements of the Residence C-1 district as detailed in this
Section 5.31 shall apply in the Residence C district for structures in existence as of
December 1, 1986 under the following limitations and conditions:
(1) Any increase in floor area or numbers of units, provided all construction occurs
within the limits of the existing structure: or
(2) For any construction without limit as to cost (notwithstanding any contrary
provisions of Section 8.23) of a nonconforming structure destroyed or damaged
by fire or other catastrophe provided the structure as restored shall not be
greater in lot coverage or volume, or shall not extend further into required yards,
than the original structure; all other provisions of Section 8.23, however, shall
continue to apply.
(j) Applicable to the first five thousand (5,000) square feet of lot area. For those
portions of any lot exceeding five thousand (5,000) square feet, the applicable
Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area shall be 0.35 for all permitted residential
uses and the Minimum Lot Area for Each Dwelling Unit shall be four thousand
(4,000) square feet. However, for any lot in existence as of June 30, 1995 that is
subsequently subdivided into two or more lots, the total amount of gross area and
number of units on the subdivided lots, in total, shall at no time exceed that
5-16
permitted by this footnote (j) on the lot before the subdivision occurred. Unless
otherwise permitted by special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal, the gross
floor area and dwelling units permitted on each subdivided lot shall be in the same
ratio as that lot's area is to the area of the unsubdivided lot. Nothing in this footnote
(j) shall prohibit the subdivision of a Townhouse Development conforming at the
time of its construction, as permitted in Section 11.10.
(k) Yard Requirements in the Residence C-2B District
1) Setbacks - In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these
yard requirements by being set back above and below ground.
2) Green Area - general
Two of the yards on a lot shall consist exclusively of green area as defined in
section 2.000. Contrary to the provisions of said definition, hard surfaced
walks and terraces shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the area of
each yard. At a minimum, green area setback shall consist of permanently
maintained densely planted trees and shrubs that may be expected to form
within three (3) years after the time of planting a continuous unbroken, year
round visual screen. Every effort shall be made to retain the best existing
trees in said setbacks to meet the requirements this section in whole or in
part. Plans for landscaping and maintenance shall be approved by the
Committee on Public Planting as appointed by the City Manager. No
Certificate of Occupancy may be granted until landscaping under the terms of
this section is completed.
(3) Lots with more than four yards. If the shape of a lot creates a situation
where there are more than four yards, this green area requirement shall apply
to half of the yards, rounded up in the instance of an odd number of yards.
(4) Lots in two or more zoning districts. Where a zoning district boundary line or
lines split a lot, a lot partially in the Residence C-2B district shall comply with
provisions elsewhere in this zoning ordinance with regard to lots in two or
more zoning districts, except that the setback and green area requirements of
this footnote shall apply to all parts of the lot regardless of zoning district.
(5) Lots abutting more restrictively zoned districts. When any lot abuts a more
restrictively zoned district or districts, all yards abutting the more restrictively
zoned district)s) shall be designated as yards required to comply with the
green area requirements of this footnote. This provision shall apply to that
quantity of abutting yards numbering up to and including the maximum
number of green area yards required by this footnote. The total number of
green area yards required on a lot shall not be changed by the provisions of
this subsection (5).
(6) Pedestrian and vehicular access.
(a) When a yard used to satisfy the Green Area Open Space requirement of
this footnote is a front yard, the Green Area Open Space may be
interrupted by not more than one path for pedestrian access to the
5-17
building. Said pedestrian path shall be constructed perpendicular to the
lot line and shall not be more than eight (8) feet wide. The green area
yard may also be interrupted by not more than one driveway constructed
perpendicular to the lot line and which is not more than twelve (12) feet
wide.
(b) The sum of the width of the said pedestrian path and driveway may not
exceed the setback provided by the smallest of the yards provided on
the lot.
(c) The areas allowed to be used for access under this subsection (6) shall
be counted as part of the twenty-five (25) percent of the total required
green area which is allowed to be use for hard surfaced walks and
terraces for the front yard in which the access areas are constructed.
(7) Townhouse Development When a lot is used for townhouse development,
the provisions of this footnote shall apply to the lot before subdivision into
townhouse lots. Subdivision into townhouse lots shall be done in such a
manner as to not affect the application of this footnote to the entire
unsubdivided lot. In particular, the pedestrian path and driveways allowed.
(l) These requirements may be reduced to a minimum required setback of ten (10) feet
with the grant of a special permit from the Planning Board provided that the yard is
suitably landscaped to effectively buffer the building walls from abutting lots.
(m) For purposes of calculating FAR and for no other purpose, notwithstanding the
definition of Lot in Article 2.000, a Lot in the Residence C-3B district may contain
non-contiguous parcels provided that all parcels are held in identical ownership, are
all located within the Residence C-3B district of any abutting Business B district, and
further provided that development on any contiguous portion of the lot does not
exceed an FAR of 4.0.
(n) In a Residence C-1 District, no building plane (excluding projections as permitted by
Section 5.24.2) may be nearer than seven feet, six inches (76) to a side lot line.
3. Setback exceptions
(a) In a Residence A-1 or A-2 district a dwelling need not set back more than the
average of the setbacks of the buildings, other than accessory buildings, on the lots
adjacent thereto on either side, but in no case may any part of a building or
accessory building extend nearer to any street line, or building line if such has been
established, than fifteen (15) feet. A vacant lot or lot occupied by a building set back
more than twenty-five (25) feet in a Residence A-1 district and more than twenty (20)
feet in a Residence A-2 district shall be considered as though occupied by a building
set back twenty-five (25) feet and twenty (20) feet respectively.
(b) In a Residence B district a dwelling need not set back more than the average of the
setbacks of the buildings, other than accessory buildings, on the lots adjacent
thereto the on either side, but in no case may any part of a building or accessory
building extend nearer to any street line, or building line if such has been
established, than ten (10) feet. A vacant lot or a lot occupied by a building set back
5-18
more than fifteen (15) feet shall be considered as though occupied by a building set
back fifteen (15) feet.
(c) In a Residence C, C-1, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, or C-3A district if a building is
hereafter erected on a lot adjacent to a building having a blank wall directly on the
side lot line, the new building may be so designed and erected that it will be flush
with that portion of the blank wall of the former building which extends along the lot
line; otherwise, however, not less than the required side yard shall be provided; in
any case the required side yard shall be provided for the remainder of the full lot
depth. In case a side wall contains windows or in case any part of a side blank wall
of an existing building shall be set back from the side lot line, then a building
hereafter erected on the lot adjacent to such an existing building shall be set back
from the side lot line in accordance with the provisions thereof.
5.32 Office Districts
1. The following dimensional requirements, set forth in Table 5-2 and modified
elsewhere in this Ordinance, shall be applicable to development in Office districts: [Note:

2. Footnotes
(a) In no case may a building be nearer the rear lot line than twenty (20) feet.
(b) As set forth in Section 5.28.1.
(c) The cornice line of the principal front wall plane facing Massachusetts Avenue shall
not exceed fifty-five (55) feet in height at the front lot line. Portions of buildings in
excess of this height shall be set back behind a thirty-five (35) degree bulk control
plane beginning at an elevation fifty-five (55) feet above the Massachusetts Avenue
front lot line. The cornice line of the principal front wall plane facing Green street
shall not exceed thirty (30) feet in height at the front lot line. Portions of building in
excess of thirty (30) feet shall be set back behind a forty-five (45) degree bulk
control plane beginning at an elevation thirty (30) feet above the Green Street front
lot line. No building or portion of a building within forty-five (45) feet of the Green
Street front lot line shall exceed forty (40) feet in height.
(d) Open space requirements for a lot shall be determined by the mix of uses on the lot.
Where one hundred (100) percent of the principal uses on a lot are residential uses
listed in Subsections 4.31 a, b, d, e, and g, an area equivalent to fifteen (15) percent
of the lot area shall be reserved as private open space. Where one hundred (100)
percent of the principal uses on the lot are other uses, an area equivalent to fifteen
5-20
(15) percent of the lot area shall be reserved as publicly beneficial open space.
Where development on a lot contains both the aforesaid residential uses and other
uses, an area equivalent to fifteen (15) percent of the lot area shall be devoted to
both types of open space in relative proportion to the gross floor areas occupied by
residential uses and other uses. The amount of each type of open space shall be
determined by the formulae below. The results of said formulae notwithstanding, a
minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the area of that portion of a lot within forty-five
(45) feet of a front lot line facing Green Street shall be devoted to landscaped green
space as specified in Subsection 4.27.3. Where more than fifty (50) percent of the
area of that portion of a lot is devoted to landscaped green space, as specified in
Subsections 4.27.2 and 4.27.3, none of such green space shall be counted in
determining compliance with this Subsection 5.332d. Where fifty (50) percent or
less of the area of that portion of a lot is devoted to landscaped green space, such
area may be counted in determining compliance with this Subsection 5.33 2d.
(1) Minimum required total area reserved for both types of open space = lot area
multiplied by .15.
(2) Share of development devoted to residential uses = gross residential floor area
divided by gross floor area of entire development.
(3) Minimum required private open space associated with residential use = total
open space required multiplied by residential share.
(4) Share of development devoted to other uses = other gross floor area divided
by gross floor area of entire development.
(5) Minimum required publicly beneficial open space = total open space
requirement multiplied by other use share.
(e) Where any lot abuts a residential district, buildings above and below ground shall be
set back a minimum of twenty (20) feet from the zoning district boundary line,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in Article 6.000 of this Ordinance.
Said setback shall consist exclusively of landscaped green area as defined in Article
2.000. Where the zoning district boundary line splits a lot the minimum twenty (20)
foot setback shall be measured from the lot line(s) located in the residential district.
At a minimum green area setback shall consist of permanently maintained, densely
planted trees and shrubs that may be expected to form within three (3) years after
time of planting a continuous, unbroken, year round visual screen. Every effort shall
be made to retain the best existing trees in said setbacks to meet the requirements of
this section in whole or in part. Plans for landscaping and maintenance shall be
approved by the Committee on Public Planting as appointed by the City Manager. No
Certificate of Occupancy may be granted until landscaping under the terms of this
section is completed.
(f) Subject to the provisions of Footnote 1 in Section 4.40  Footnotes to the Table of
Use Regulations.
(g) Thirty-five (35) feet [or height permitted in the abutting residential district, but in no
case higher than fifty-five (55) feet] within fifty (50) feet of a residential district line.
Where the zoning district boundary splits a lot the fifty (50) feet shall be measured
5-21
from the lot lines located in the residential district. The height, however, may exceed
thirty-five (35) feet provided the building is set back a minimum distance equal to
two-thirds (2/3) the height.
(h) Measured from the centerline of the street but in no case may a building be nearer
the street than ten (10) feet.
(i) However, for the side yard of any lot abutting another lot (where that lot does not
abut Massachusetts Avenue and where all or a majority of it is located in a
residence district) no building shall be set nearer than twenty feet to (1) either the
residence/Business A-2 zoning district line where the lot line is located in the BA-2
District or (2) the side lot line itself where that lot line is located in the residence
district. Nevertheless, the provisions of the following paragraph shall continue to
apply.
If a building is hereafter erected on a lot adjacent to a building having a blank wall
directly on the side lot line, the new building may be so designed and erected that it
will be flush with that portion of the blank wall of the former building which extends
along the lot line; otherwise no less than the required side yard setback shall be
provided. In the case that any portion of a side wall of the existing building contains
windows or is set back form the property line, then a building hereafter erected on
the lot adjacent to such an existing building shall be set back from the side lot line as
required.
(j) Or two-thirds (2/3) of the height of the rear wall whichever is greater; however in the
Business C and Business C-1 districts no rear yard shall be required where the rear
lot line abuts a lot all of which lies in a business or industrial district.
(k) Provided however that any portion of a building having a height greater than thirtyfive
(35) feet shall be set back of a bulk control plane rising at an angle of forty-five
(45) degree from the plane of the principal front wall and rear wall planes beginning
at a height of thirty-five (35) feet.
Where the parcel has frontage on two or more streets, this setback plane provision
shall apply only to the front wall plane facing the principal abutting arterial street and
to the opposite wall plane facing either a side or front property line.
In addition to the above provisions, that portion of a building located within fifty (50)
feet of a residential zoning district line shall be limited to thirty-five (35) feet where
the maximum height permitted in the residential district is thirty-five (35) feet or less.
(l) The maximum height of a building may be increased to sixty (60) feet provided the
average height of the building is fifty (50) feet (excluding any portion of the building
devoted to parking which is not covered with building included in gross floor area).
The heights of the several parts of the building shall be such that the volume of
building exceeding fifty (50) feet in height shall be equal to or less than the volume
of space lying between the fifty (50) foot height and portions of building less than fifty
(50) feet in height, as illustrated below:
Volume 1 (area of a building at a single height - 1 above fifty feet x the difference
between height - 1 and fifty feet ) + Volume 2 (area of building at a single height - 2
above fifty feet x the difference between the height - 2 and fifty feet ) MUST EQUAL
5-22
OR BE LESS THAN THE SUM OF Volume 1' (area of building at a single height - 1'
below fifty feet x the difference between height 1' and fifty feet ) + Volume 2' (area
of building at single height - 2' below fifty feet x the difference between height - 2'
and fifty feet).
(m) Or the setback of the principal front wall plane of any adjacent building facing the
same street, whichever is less.
(n) Of the total FAR permitted on the lot the maximum ratio of floor area to lot area for
permitted principal uses other than residential uses specified in Section 4.31 shall
not exceed 2.75. The maximum ratio of floor area to lot area for permitted
residential uses specified in Section 4.31 shall be 2.5 as of right; it may be increased
to 3.0 and lot area per dwelling unit decreased to three hundred (300) after the
issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided the following conditions
are met:
1. At least seventy-five (75) percent of the gross floor area on the lot is devoted to
residential uses specified in Section 4.31.
2. All parking on site is covered and enclosed.
3. Fifteen (15) percent or more of the lot is green area or other open space
acceptable to the Planning Board.
4. The building shall be subject to mandatory design review.
(o) H+L/6 for all buildings having fifty (50) percent or more of their gross floor area
devoted to residential uses specified in Section 4.31 where the side lot line abuts or
is within fifty (50) feet of a lot residentially used, the majority of which lies in a
residential district.
(p) For development in which all parking is provided entirely below grade, the following
dimensional modifications shall be allowed:
(i) FAR may be increased to 2.0
(ii) Front, Side and Rear yard requirements shall be modified to a minimum
of ten (10) feet. Sites with two front yards that have a radiused front yard
where two streets intersect may be considered as if the adjoining
property lines are projected to intersect. Projecting bays and roof decks
which are located on portions of a building below thirty-five (35) feet in
height shall be eligible for the setback exception allow in Section 5.24.2
even if the structure itself if greater than 35 feet in height.
(iii) Building height for a residential or mixed-use structure may be increased
to a maximum of forth-four (44) feet. However, for any portion of a
structure that abuts a lot in a residential district, the height of the building
shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet within fifteen (15) feet of the lot line.

5.50 SPECIAL DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
5.51 Lot Size Requirements for Elderly Oriented Housing. The required number of square
feet of lot area per dwelling unit in elderly oriented housing or for each living space in
elderly oriented congregate housing is decreased to one half (1/2) the number of
square feet of lot area per dwelling unit customarily required in Section 5.30 of this
Ordinance.
5.52 Townhouse Development. The dimensional requirements of this article may be
reduced for townhouse developments as governed by the regulations of Article 11.000.
5.53 In Residence A-1 and Residence A-2 districts, only one structure containing a principal
use shall be allowed on a lot.
5-26
In Residence B districts only one structure containing a principal residential use shall
be allowed on a lot except as set forth below:
1. More than one structure containing a principal residential use shall be allowed on a
lot provided all portions of all structures are located no farther than seventy-five
(75) feet from any street line to which the lot abuts. However, those elements of a
structure that are permitted to extend into required yards as set forth in Section
5.24.2, may extend in a similar manner beyond the seventy-five foot limit.
2. By special permit from the Planning Board provided the Board finds
(a) that development in the form of two or more structures on the lot will not
significantly increase or may reduce the impact of the new construction should
it occur in a single structure; or
(b) That two or more structures may provide identifiable benefits beyond that
provided should all construction be in a single structure. In making its findings
the Board shall consider the impact of the new construction on the following:
(1) the extent to which the preservation of a large contiguous open space in
the rear of the lot or series of adjacent lots is achieved through the
provision of a rear yard setback significantly greater than that required and
through the dedication of that rear yard as Green Area, as defined in this
Ordinance,
(2) incentives for the location of buildings and parking facilities in the front half
of a lot in a pattern compatible with the development pattern prevailing in
the neighborhood,
(3) the extent to which two or more structures provides an enhanced living
environment for residents on the lot,
(4) incentives to retain existing structures on a lot, particularly any structure
determined to be a Preferably Preserved Significant structure by the
Cambridge Historical Commission,
(5) the opportunities presented to reduce the visual impact of parking from the
public street and from adjacent lots,
(6) The increased opportunities to reduce the height and bulk as new
construction is deeper into a lot or closer to structures on abutting lots.
In Residence A-1, A-2 and B districts there shall be no limit on the number of those
structures on a lot that contain principal nonresidential uses exclusively, provided
all other requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are met.
5.54 Special Regulations for Municipal Elementary and Middle (K-8) Schools. The following
regulations shall apply to the reconstruction, alteration or expansion of existing municipal
K-8 school uses. The regulations of this Section shall apply where development is
proposed on lots where the existing and proposed principal use is a municipal K-8 school;
however, such lots may include other uses customarily associated with a municipal K-8
school such as public recreation, public open space, community center, pre-school and
after school programs or municipal library. Where a regulation in this Section 5.54
5-27
contradicts any regulation set forth elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance, including the
requirements of Article 8.000, the regulations of this Section 5.54 shall apply.
5.54.1 The following modifications to the dimensional, parking and other requirements applicable
in the zoning district as set forth in Paragraphs (a-f) below shall be permitted upon
issuance of a Building Permit by the Commissioner of Inspectional Services, subject to
the limitation set forth in Paragraph (g) below:
(a) The maximum permitted Floor Area Ratio shall be the existing Floor Area Ratio for all
buildings on the lot at the time of application for a Building Permit, or the maximum
Floor Area Ratio allowed under the applicable zoning district regulations, whichever is
greater.
(b) Areas located atop the roof of a building that are used as a playground or outdoor
educational space for school-related activities shall not be included in the calculation
of Gross Floor Area or Floor Area Ratio on the lot, provided that the space is
substantially open to the sky (structures covered with web or netting shall not be
considered enclosures).
(c) For any new structures, additions to an existing structure, or portions of a structure
that are demolished and reconstructed in a residential zoning district, the minimum
yard requirements otherwise applicable in the district shall not apply, provided that no
new structure may be nearer than ten (10) feet to any public street or nearer than
fifteen (15) feet to any other abutting lot line; however, for portions of a lot located
within an Open Space zoning district, the minimum yard requirements in the base
zoning district shall apply. For existing portions of a structure which are neither
demolished nor expanded, the required yards shall be those of the structure existing
at the time of application for a Building Permit.
(d) For any new structures, additions to a structure, or portions of a structure that are
demolished and reconstructed in a residential zoning district, the maximum building
height shall be forty-five (45) feet, or the maximum height allowed under zoning
district regulations, whichever is greater; however, for portions of a lot located within
an Open Space zoning district, the maximum height in the base zoning district shall
apply. For existing portions of a structure which are neither demolished nor
expanded, the height of the existing structure shall be permitted.
(e) The minimum required number of off-street motor vehicle parking spaces shall be the
number of legally existing off-street parking spaces on the lot or the minimum number
of off-street parking spaces required by Article 6.000, whichever is fewer. Where
existing parking spaces are proposed to be reconstructed or relocated, those spaces
shall conform to the location, design and layout requirements of Article 6.000.
(f) The minimum required number of off-street loading bays shall be the number of
legally existing off-street loading bays on the lot or the minimum number of off-street
loading bays required by Article 6.000, whichever is fewer. Where loading bays are
proposed to be reconstructed or relocated, those loading bays shall conform to the
location, design and layout requirements of Article 6.000.
(g) The provisions set forth in Paragraphs (a-f) above shall apply only if there is no net
reduction in the area of Public Recreational Open Space on the lot. For the purposes
of this Section 5.54, Public Recreational Open Space shall be defined as any
contiguous outdoor space having both a width and length of at least twenty-five (25)
feet that is available for customary recreational use by the general public and that
5-28
meets the definition of Public Open Space as set forth in Article 2.000 of this Zoning
Ordinance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the definition of Public Open
Space, areas beneath unenclosed structures that are accessory to outdoor public
recreational uses, such as play structures, shading devices or player dugouts, may be
counted as Public Recreational Open Space. Public Recreational Open Space may
be altered or relocated on the lot, provided that the total area of space meeting the
definition herein is not decreased.
5.54.2 Where it is proposed to reconstruct, alter or expand an existing municipal K-8 school use,
any dimensional, parking or other zoning requirements, including those set forth in
Section 5.54.1 above, may be waived upon the granting of a special permit by the
Planning Board, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below.
(a) The Floor Area Ratio on the lot shall not exceed the existing Floor Area Ratio on the
lot, except that the Planning Board may approve an increase in Floor Area Ratio to
1.25 for any portion of the lot located within a residential zoning district (but excluding
portions of the lot located within an Open Space zoning district).
(b) For portions of a lot located within an Open Space zoning district, the minimum yard
requirements in the base zoning district shall continue to apply to any new buildings or
additions to buildings.
(c) In a residential zoning district, the maximum height of any new building or addition to
a building shall not exceed fifty-five (55) feet, except that the Planning Board may
approve heights of up to sixty-five (65) feet for portions of a building located at least
fifty (50) feet from any lot line. In an Open Space zoning district, the height of any new
building or addition to a building shall not exceed the maximum height allowed in the
base zoning district.
(d) The minimum off-street parking requirement shall not be waived except upon
issuance of a special permit for Reduction in Required Parking under Section 6.35.1.
The Planning Board may approve a reduction in the number of required loading bays
upon finding that the proposed loading bays are sufficient to serve the school use.
New parking spaces and loading bays shall conform to the location, design and layout
requirements of Article 6.000.
(e) The net area of Public Recreational Open Space on the lot, as defined in Subsection
5.54.1, Paragraph (g) above, shall not be reduced by more than ten percent (10%) of
the existing area. In approving any net reduction in Public Recreational Open Space,
the Planning Board shall make a determination that the proposed Public Recreational
Open Space shall provide benefits to the general public that are at least
commensurate with the existing Public Open Space on the lot.
(f) In addition to the General Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 10.43 and the
Citywide Urban Design Guidelines set forth in Section 19.30, the Planning Board shall
make a determination that the proposed changes to the lot have been designed to
minimize or mitigate adverse impacts on neighboring residential properties. In making
this finding, the Planning Board shall consider the following:
(i) Arrangement of building height and bulk within the lot.
(ii) Access and egress for pedestrians, bicycles and motor vehicles, including pick-up
and drop-off areas for buses and cars.
5-29
(iii) Location and screening of functions such as parking, loading, trash handling and
mechanical equipment.
(iv) Current impact of existing buildings and existing patterns of use on the site.

REQUIREMENTS
6.11 Intent. It is the intent of this Article 6.000 to reduce traffic congestion, noise, vibrations,
fumes and safety hazards caused by large commercial trucks, thereby promoting the
safety, health and welfare of the public, by establishing requirements for off street
parking, bicycle parking and loading and restrictions on the use of City street during the
night-time by large commercial trucks with points of origin and destinations outside the
City of Cambridge in order to implement the purposed of the The Zoning Act, Section 2A
of Chapter 808, and Article 1.000. Section 1.30 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance,
including:
? to lessen congestion in the streets
? to conserve health
? to conserve the value of land and buildings
? to prevent pollution of the environment
? to protect residential neighborhoods from incompatible activities, and
? to preserve and increase the amenities of the city.
The number of parking and loading spaces required herein varies according to type,
location and intensity of development in the different zoning districts, and to proximity of
public transit facilities. This Article 6.000 requires development of adequate parking
facilities to meet the reasonable needs of all building and land users without establishing
regulations which unnecessarily encourage automobile usage. The parking and bicycle
parking standards contained herein are intended to encourage public transit, bicycle
usage and walking in lieu of automobiles where a choice of travel mode exists. It is also
the purpose of this Article to allow flexibility in providing required parking through shared
or off site arrangements in order to accommodate the automobile in the urban
environment in a less disruptive way. Development regulations and design standards
have been established to reduce hazard to pedestrians on public sidewalks, to ensure
6-2
the usefulness of parking, bicycle parking and loading facilities, and where appropriate,
to avoid potential adverse impacts on adjacent land uses, and to enhance the visual
quality of the city.
6.12 Applicability. The off street parking and loading provisions of this Article 6.000 shall apply
as follows:
(a) For new structures erected and new uses of land established or authorized after the
effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto, as well as for external
additions of Gross Floor Area to existing structures for any use, accessory off street
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations for the
districts in which such structures or uses are located.
In the case of an addition of Gross Floor Area to an existing structure (lawfully
erected prior to the effective date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto),
which addition contains nonresidential uses, off street parking and loading facilities
shall only be required when the total of such additions occurring from the effective
date of this Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto increases the Gross Floor Area
of the existing structure by fifteen (15) percent or more. If such an increase occurs,
additional off street parking or loading facilities as required herein shall be provided
for the total increase in intensity subsequent to the effective date of this Article 6.000
or any amendment thereto.
(b) When the intensity of an existing use within any existing structure (or lot in the case
of 6.36.7 l and m and 6.36.8 f and g) is increased through addition of dwelling units,
floor area, seating capacity or other units of measurement specified in Section 6.30
or Section 6.60 (but not including any uses in a new external addition to that
structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a) above), off street
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such increase in
intensity of use.
However, a nonresidential use lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto shall not be required to provide off street
parking and loading facilities for such increase unless and until the aggregate
increase in units of measure shall equal fifteen (15) percent or more of the units of
measurement existing upon said effective date. If such an increase occurs,
additional off street parking or loading facilities as required herein shall be provided
for the total increase in intensity subsequent to the effective date of this Article 6.000
or any amendment thereto.
(c) When the use of an existing structure (but not including the use of a new external
addition to that structure, which shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (a)
above) is changed to a new nonresidential use, off street parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required in the schedule of parking requirements in
Subsection 6.36 and the schedule of loading requirements in Subsection 6.60. Any
maximum requirements specified in Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum
requirements, shall be applicable to such changes in use.
However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this
Article 6.000 or any amendment thereto, additional off street parking and loading
6-3
facilities shall be required only to the extent that the required amount for the new
nonresidential use would exceed the amount required for the previous use if said
previous use were subject to the schedule of parking and loading requirements.
In either case, the first four (4) spaces required need not be provided.
(d) When the nonresidential use of an existing structure is changed to a residential use,
off street parking facilities shall be provided as required in the schedule of parking
requirements in Subsection 6.36. Any maximum requirements specified in
Subsection 6.36, as well as minimum requirements, shall be applicable to such
changes in use.
(e) Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided according to the requirements set
forth in Section 6.100. Wherever the term parking is used in this Zoning Ordinance
without specific reference to bicycles, such term shall refer to parking for motor
vehicles and not bicycles.
However, if said structure was lawfully erected prior to the effective date of this Article
6.000 or any amendment thereto and the nonresidential use of the structure is proposed
to be changed to an Affordable Housing Project as herein defined, additional off street
parking facilities shall be required as provided above, except that for that portion of the
Project consisting of Affordable Units additional off street parking shall be provided at the
rate of 60% of the parking otherwise required in Section 6.36.
For purposes of this Section 6.12 (d) an Affordable Housing Project shall be a residential
development in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling units are considered
Affordable Units for occupancy by Eligible Households as defined in Section 11.200 of
the Zoning Ordinance.
6.13 Scope of Off Street Parking Regulations. All accessory parking facilities shall conform to
all regulations set forth in this Article governing the use, design and operation of such
facilities. However, the provisions of this Article 6.000, notwithstanding, any special
parking requirements for townhouse developments specified in Section 11.10, for
planned unit developments specified in Article 13.000, for projects in the Mixed Use
Development District specified in Article 14.000 or for special permits specified
elsewhere in this Ordinance shall be applicable for those projects.
6.14 Restoration. When an existing structure or use is restored and resumes operation after
being destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, off street parking,
bicycle parking and loading facilities shall be provided at least equivalent to that in
existence at the time of such destruction or damage. If the extent of such damage is
such that the cost of restoration is fifty (50) percent or more of the replacement value of
the structure or use, then parking, bicycle parking and loading facilities meeting the
requirements of this Article 6.000 shall be provided. However, in no case shall it be
necessary to replace or continue any parking, bicycle parking or loading facilities which
were in excess of those required by the schedules of parking and loading requirements
for equivalent amounts of new uses or construction.
6.15 Existing Parking Facilities. Accessory off street parking facilities established after March
15, 1961, shall not hereafter be reduced below - of if already less than, shall not be
6-4
further reduced below - the minimum requirements under the provisions of this Article
6.000. Accessory off street parking facilities in existence as of March 15, 1961 shall only
be required if such facilities have been used to satisfy parking requirements after March
15, 1961.
6.16 Dedicated Off Street Parking Facilities. Required off street parking facilities which after
development are later dedicated to and accepted by the City and maintained by the City
for off street parking purposes, shall be deemed to continue to serve the structures or
uses to meet the requirements for which they were originally provided.
6.17 Compatibility with the E.P.A. Clean Air Regulations In addition to the regulations
contained in this Article, all off street parking facilities must comply with restrictions
contained in the Transportation Control Plan for the Metropolitan Boston Interstate Air
Quality Control Region as promulgated by the United State Environmental Protection
Agency to the extent the same are in force and effect.
6.18 Compatibility with Handicapped Access Rules. In addition to the regulations contained in
this Article 6.000, all off street parking facilities must comply with the currently applicable
Rules and Regulations of the Architectural Barriers Board of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to the extent the same are in force and effect.
6.20 OFF STREET PARKING REGULATIONS
6.21 Use. All accessory parking facilities provided in accordance with this Article shall be
maintained exclusively for the parking of motor vehicles so long as the use exists which
the facilities were designed to serve. Such facilities shall not be used for automobile
sales, dead storage, or repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind, with the
exception of emergency service when needed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Ordinance, parking facilities maintained in accordance with this Article 6.000 may
be used by Carsharing Vehicles subject to the provisions and limitations set forth in
Section 6.24 of this Zoning Ordinance.
6.22 Location. All accessory off street parking facilities shall be located in accordance with
the provisions of subsections 6.22.1, 6.22.2 and 6.22.3. For purposes of this Section
6.22 lot shall also mean the Development Parcel of any Planned Unit Development
regulated by the provisions of Article 12.000 and Article 13.000 without regard to a lot or
lots that may initially constitute the Development Parcel or any lot or lots created within
the Development Parcel subsequent to the approval of the PUD by the Planning Board.
6.22.1 Accessory off street parking facilities may be located on the same lot as the use being
served or on another lot that has the same or less restrictive zoning classification as the
lot on which the use being served is located in accordance with the following conditions:
(a) (1) said other lot is contiguous to the lot on which the use being served is located;
or
(2) said other lot is within three hundred (300) feet of the lot on which the use being
served is located and the use being served is nonresidential; or
6-5
(3) said lot is within three thousand (3000) feet of the lot on which the use being
served is located, such use is an institutional use listed in Subsection 6.36.3b
and said use is located within a five acre area containing one or more lots,
contiguous except for streets, owned by a single institution; and
(b) said lot is not now and was not within the past five (5) years the location of a
preferably preserved significant building (as defined in the General Ordinances of
Cambridge) as determined by the Cambridge Historical Commission.
(c) however, no off site accessory parking facilities shall be allowed to meet the
requirements for Subsection 6.36.5h Theatre or hall for public gatherings.
6.22.2 The Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for off site accessory parking not
allowed in Subsection 6.22.1 (a) provided that convenient and safe access from the
parking facility to the use being served is provided in accordance with the following
conditions:
(a) No off site accessory parking facility may be located on a lot which has a more
restrictive zoning classification than the lot on which the use being served is located.
(b) Off site accessory parking facilities shall be located within four hundred (400) feet of
the lot being served for residential uses and within one thousand (1000) feet of the
lot for other uses.
6.22.3 [PARAGRAPH DELETED]
6.22.4 Accessory off street parking spaces required under the provisions of this Article 6.000
need not be in the City of Cambridge.
6.22.5 Distance Measurements For Parking Facilities. In all cases where distance
measurements between a lot and off site parking facilities or other specified area are
specified in this Article 6.000, such distance shall be measured as a straight line from the
nearest point for the lot on which the off site accessory parking is located, to the nearest
transit station entrance, or to the nearest street line or other boundary of another
specified area.
6.23 Control of Off Site Parking Facilities. Where accessory parking facilities are allowed on
land other than the lot on which the use being served is located said other land shall be
in identical ownership or binding commitments shall exist to guarantee, to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Superintendent of Buildings or to the special permit granting authority,
that the off site parking will continue to be available for the period during which the use or
uses that the parking serves may be expected to be in existence. Such commitments
shall be evidenced by negotiated lease agreement, recorded covenant or comparable
legal instrument. Such instrument shall be duly recorded at the Middlesex County
Registry of Deeds and certification of such recording provided to the Superintendent of
Buildings or the special permit granting authority.
6.24 Carsharing Provisions. The provisions of this Section 6.24 shall govern the allowed use
parking spaces for Carsharing. Where the provisions of this Section 6.24 may conflict
with any requirements set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, the provisions of this
Section shall control.
6-6
6.24.1 Intent. This Section 6.24 is intended to allow the limited use of parking spaces for
Carsharing as a means to provide mobility options for Cambridge residents, employees
and visitors who may not possess a private automobile, thereby promoting City goals by
increasing mobility, reducing reliance on automobile ownership and use, and lessening
the total demand for parking spaces.
6.24.2 Definitions. For the purpose of this Ordinance, Carsharing shall mean the use of parking
spaces by Carsharing Vehicles and Carsharing Organizations, as defined below:
(a) Carsharing Vehicle shall be defined as a private motor vehicle that is made
available to members of a Carsharing Organization primarily for hourly or other
short-term use through a self-service fully automated reservation system, but no
by mean of a separate written agreement that is entered into each time a vehicle
is transferred to a customer. A Carsharing Vehicle must be owned, maintained or
administered by a Carsharing Organization.
(b) Carsharing Organization shall be defined as a membership-based entity with a
distributed fleet of Carsharing Vehicles that charges a use-based fee related to a
specific vehicle.
6.24.3 General Limitations
(a) Carsharing Vehicles shall only be allowed in parking facilities that are lawfully
established and conforming to the dimensional and other requirements of Article
6.000, or, if not, are lawfully non-conforming.
(b) A Carsharing Vehicle authorized to this Section 6.24 shall be properly registered
with the Registry of Motor Vehicle.
(c) A Carsharing Vehicle located within an authorized parking facility shall be
maintained for active use by authorized operators and not stored for other
purposes. No sales, servicing, dead storage, repair, administrative or similar
functions shall occur and no personnel shall be employed on the site except for
occasional short-term maintenance of vehicles (such as interior vacuuming)
unless otherwise permitted by the use regulations in the zoning district.
(d) Carsharing Vehicles administered by a Carsharing Organization shall be
routinely accessed directly by users without any assistance or supervision by
company personnel.
(e) All owners of that portion of a lot accommodating the operation or parking of a
Carsharing Vehicle, or their legally authorized representative, including a
condominium association where applicable, shall be required to grant permission
for the operation or parking of a Carsharing Vehicle on their property.
(f) Parking spaces devoted to Carsharing Vehicles shall be registered with the
Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TPTD), which shall keep a
recorded of the address, location, number of spaces, property ownership, and
Carsharing Organization if applicable, and certify that such spaces may
6-7
accommodate the operation of Carsharing Vehicles in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules, or regulations. If any such spaces are relocated within a
facility, or if the property ownership or Carsharing Organization is changed, then
the registration with TPTD shall be updated accordingly within one month. TPTD
may promulgate more detailed regulations pertaining to the safe operation as to
which parking spaces on a lot are best suited to Carsharing Vehicles operations.
(g) Prior to assigning parking spaces for use by Carsharing Vehicles, the Carsharing
Organization shall send a written notification to all residential dwellings within
one hundred (100) feet of the facility in which the spaces are located, including
any access and egress drives. Notifications shall be sent to individual dwelling
units or to a residential building manager if applicable, to distributed to residents.
The notification shall, at a minimum, provide contact information for the
Carsharing Organization so that residents may ask questions or report concerns
related to the operation of the Carsharing Vehicles. A copy of notification and a
list of the addresses to which it was sent shall be provided to TPTD upon register
the parking spaces.
6.25.4 Principal Use Parking Provisions
(a) Within principal use parking facilities established under the provisions of Section
4.32(b) (Automobile Parking Lot for Private Passenger Car) or Commercial
Parking Facilities registered with the Department of Traffic, Parking and
Transportation per the provisions of Chapter 10.16 of the Cambridge Municipal
Code, there shall be no limitations on the number of Carsharing Vehicles that
may be maintained for active use at the facility.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of
Carsharing Vehicles for active use within a principal use or commercial parking
facility in accordance with this Section 6.24 shall not cause any change in the
use designation of that facility or affect any other regulation that may be
applicable to that facility.
6.24.4 Accessory Parking Provisions.
(a) Within parking facilities that are accessory to non-residential uses, there shall be no
limitation on the number of Carsharing Vehicles that may be maintained for active
use at the facility.
(b) Within parking facilities that are accessory to residential uses, the number of parking
spaces maintained for active use by Carsharing Vehicles shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of either the minimum number of parking spaces required by zoning or
special permit or the number of parking spaces provided to serve the principal
residential use on the lot, whichever is greater.
(c) Driveways of single-family residential homes may not be used by Carsharing
Vehicles, except when the Carsharing Vehicle is being used by a resident of or visitor
to the single family home.
6-8
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the maintenance of
Carsharing Vehicles within an accessory parking facility in accordance with this
Section 6.24 shall not cause any change in the use of that facility nor any violation of
the accessory parking requirements applicable to the principal uses served by that
facility, provided that such Carsharing Vehicles are available for use by any occupant
of the principal use that is otherwise qualified to operate a motor vehicle. Where a
Carsharing Vehicle is owned or operated by a Carsharing Organization, ordinary fees
and other terms of service may apply.
6.24.5 Allowed Modifications
(a) Grandfathering. Parking spaces that were lawfully used by Carsharing Vehicles as
of the date of the first publication of notice of the public hearing by the Planning
Board of this Section 6.24 shall be allowed to continue to be maintained for active
use by Carsharing Vehicles regardless of whether or not the limitations of this
Section 6.24 are met. All such parking spaces must be registered with the
Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department in accordance with
Section 6.24.3, paragraph (g) within six months of the date of adoption of this
Section.
(b) Special Permit. The Planning Board may approve any modifications to the limitations
set forth in Section 6.24.5 upon issuance of a special permit, which shall be granted
if the Planning Board finds that the requested modification is consistent with the
intent set forth in Section 6.24.1 and conforms to the general special permit criteria
set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance.
6.30 PARKING QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS
6.31 Required Amount of Parking. Off street parking facilities shall be provided for each use
of a lot or structure in the amount specified in the schedule of parking requirements
contained in Subsection 6.36. Said schedule specifies the amount of accessory off street
parking required for each type of land use listed in Table of Use Regulations in this
Ordinance. The amount of required parking is also based on the intensity of
development permitted in the district in which the use is located.
6.31.1 The schedule of parking requirements in Subsection 6.36 specifies the unit of measure
requiring the provision of one parking space. Square footage requirements are geared to
gross floor area. Each unit of measure, however, shall specifically not apply to any
Gross Floor Area devoted to parking facilities, which shall not require the provision of any
accessory parking.
6.31.2 In general the schedule in Subsection 6.36 specifies a minimum requirement, but in
some instances a maximum amount of parking is stipulated [Example: for a general office
use (6.36.4 d) in a Business C district, the minimum requirement is one space per 800
square feet of gross floor area and the maximum is one space per 400 square feet of
gross floor area.] Where there are two such listings the first is the minimum requirement
and the second is the maximum limitation. Relief from both the minimum parking
requirement and maximum parking limitation may be obtained only after the grant of a
6-9
special permit as provided in Section 6.35 below. With the grant of a special permit the
maximum parking limitation may be exceeded provided, however, that the provisions with
regard to gross floor area as set forth in Section 6.31.3 are met.
6.31.3 Any parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum requirements specified in
Section 6.36 shall be counted in determining Gross Floor Area. In such cases a
proportional share of the entire parking facility (not only the area of the spaces) shall be
credited toward Gross Floor Area. The area counted as Gross Floor Area shall be
determined by multiplying the total area of the parking facility by the percentage that the
proposed number of spaces exceeds the maximum allowed number of spaces.
6.31.4 For uses not listed in Subsection 6.36, the Board of Zoning Appeal shall determine the
required amount of parking if it issues a use variance for such use.
6.31.5 All commercial uses shall also be required to provide a parking space for each
commercial vehicle customarily used in conjunction with the operation of such use at
such location.
6.32 Parking Exemptions
6.32.1 Small Business. The minimum amount of parking required by Subsection 6.36 Schedule
of Parking and Loading Requirements shall be waived for any nonresidential use in an
office, business, or industrial district if such use would require four (4) or fewer spaces.
However, such nonresidential use shall be located in a building or row of attached
buildings which contains a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less of gross
floor area devoted to nonresidential use.
6.32.2 Institutions. Where an institution provides dormitory, fraternity, faculty, employee or other
residence accommodations, the number of parking spaces provided as a result thereof
may be deducted from the requirements established to satisfy the needs of classrooms,
libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, similar educational areas or dining facilities normally
used by such residential occupants. In order to qualify for such deduction, the
institutional applicant shall submit to the Building Department the institutions current
residential parking plan clearly indicating the location of all existing and proposed
residential parking facilities available at the institution.
6.33 Computation. Where a building or lot is used by two or more activities that fall into
different classes of use in Subsection 6.36, the off street parking required shall be the
sum of the requirements for each individual use. Required parking spaces for accessory
uses shall be determined in the same manner as for principal use. Where the
computation results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be
counted as one. Where the computation of required parking for a building with more than
one class of use results in multiple fractional numbers, such fractions shall be carried to
the final sum.
6.34 Parking Space Size Allocation. In all parking facilities required to have five or more
spaces, a combination of regular and compact spaces may be provide; however, no
more than fifty (50) percent of the required spaces shall be designed for compact cars
(as specified in Subsection 6.42). All off street parking facilities shall contain spaces
designed for handicapped access. The number of such spaces shall be determined by
6-10
the requirements of the currently applicable Rules and Regulations of the Architectural
Barriers Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
6.35 Relief from Parking Requirements. Any required amount of parking may be reduced by
issuance of a special permit from Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided below.
However, handicapped parking required by Subsection 6.34, and commercial vehicle
parking required by Subsection 6.31.5 shall not be reduced from the original requirement.
Bicycle parking requirements may not be modified pursuant to this Section 6.35, and may
be modified only as allowed in Section 6.100. The parking maximum limitation may be
exceeded only with the grant of a special permit from the Planning Board, as provided
below, subject to the provisions with regard to Gross Floor Area as provided in Section
6.31.3.
6.35.1 Reduction of Required Parking. Any minimum required amount of parking may be
reduced only upon issuance of a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals. A
special permit shall be granted only if the Board determines and cites evidence in its
decision that the lesser amount of parking will not cause excessive congestion, endanger
public safety, substantially reduce parking availability for other uses or otherwise
adversely impact the neighborhood, or that such lesser amount of parking will provide
positive environmental or other benefits to the users of the lot and the neighborhood,
including specifically, among other benefits, assisting in the provision of affordable
housing units. In making such a determination the Board shall also consider whether or
not less off street parking is reasonable in light of the following:
(1) The availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being served
and/or the proximity of an MBTA transit station.
(2) The availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use
being served provided the requirements of Section 6.23 are satisfied.
(3) Shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user
demands at different times, provided that no more than seventy-five (75) percent
of the lesser minimum parking requirements for each use shall be satisfied with
such shared spaces and that the requirements of Subsection 6.23 are satisfied.
Example: Office and Theatre uses with peak user demands at different
times. Office requires a minimum of one hundred and fifty (150)
spaces and the theatre requires a minimum of one hundred
(100). Seventy-five (75) percent of the lesser minimum
requirement is seventy-five (75) (75% of 100). Therefore
seventy-five (75) spaces can be shared but twenty-five (25)
(100-25) would still be required, making the total amount or
required parking for both uses (150 + 25) one hundred and
seventy-five (175).
(4) Age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of
auto usage; and
6-11
(5) Impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot
or the adjacent lots including reduction in green space, destruction of significant
existing trees and other vegetation, destruction of existing dwelling units,
significant negative impact on the historic resources on the lot, impairment of the
urban design objectives of the city as set forth in Section 19.30 of the Zoning
Ordinance, or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways.
(6) The provision of required parking for developments containing affordable housing
units, and especially for developments employing the increased FAR and
Dwelling unit density provisions of Section 11.200, will increase the cost of the
development, will require variance relief from other zoning requirements
applicable to the development because of limitations of space on the lot, or will
significantly diminish the environmental quality for all residents of the
development.
For a project seeking a reduction in required off-street parking for residential uses, a
Parking Analysis shall be required as part of the Special Permit Application as set forth in
Section 6.35.3.
6.35.2 Exceeding Maximum Allowed Parking. Any maximum allowed amount of parking may be
exceeded only upon issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board. Any parking
area in excess of the maximum limitation will have an impact on calculation of gross floor
area as provided at Section 6.31.3. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit to
allow exceedance of a maximum limitation only upon making the following
determinations:
(1) Reasonable parking and transportation demand management measures are being
implemented to reduce the need for the additional off street parking;
(2) The additional spaces reflect parking demand that exceeds that which is common for
this use as categorized in Section 6.36, owing to unique characteristics of the users
or the activity that result in a high level of automobile parking demand;
(3) The additional parking demand cannot reasonably be accommodated through
contract or other arrangement making use of available off-site parking;
(4) The additional parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits to the
users of the lot, to the neighborhood and the City which outweigh adverse effects,
after consideration of the following: congestion, traffic increases on residential
streets, danger to public safety or deterioration of travel conditions for pedestrians,
cyclists or users of public transit.
In its decision the Planning Board shall cite evidence supporting its determinations, and
may impose such conditions as are necessary to mitigate all negative impacts on the
neighborhood and the environment which would otherwise result from the greater
allowed amount of parking.
6.35.3 Parking Analysis
6.35.31 The purpose of a Parking Analysis is to provide quantitative data to assist a special
permit granting authority in considering certain projects. A Parking Analysis shall be
submitted where it is specifically required by any provision of this Zoning Ordinance. A
6-12
special permit granting authority may also request that elements of a Parking Analysis be
provided when considering a project that proposes a deviation from parking requirements
specified in the Zoning Ordinance or an increase in development density above the
maximum allowed as-of-right under base zoning regulations.
6.35.32 Where a Parking Analysis is specifically required by any provision of this Zoning
Ordinance, the proponent shall first consult with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department to determine the scope and methodology of such an analysis. The results of
the Parking Analysis shall be included in any Special Permit Application for the project.
6.35.33 For residential projects, a Parking Analysis shall include some or all of the following, with
the specific type and level of analysis to be determined by the Traffic, Parking and
Transportation Department based on the relevant characteristics of the proposal:
(a) Estimates of the projects parking demand, as evidenced by vehicle ownership rates
and peak parking occupancy data for comparable nearby residential projects,
resident parking permit and motor vehicle registration data for the area, and/or other
indicators of parking demand. These estimates should account for daytime and
nighttime parking. Estimates may account for differences in parking demand given
the occupancy of units, such as owner-occupied vs. rental units, market-rate vs.
below-market-rate units, or elderly-oriented vs. conventional units. Estimates may
also account for anticipated vacancy rates.
(b) Maps showing the distance to alternate transportation options in the area, including
MBTA rapid transit stations and bus routes, bike facilities, and car-sharing services.
(c) Studies of on-street parking capacity and utilization in the vicinity of the project. Such
studies should be conducted at night, and should account for the normal activity
hours of other land uses in the area.
(d) Where applicable, inventories and peak occupancy data for nearby off-site parking
that will be available to the projects residents or visitors, either on a round-the-clock
basis or by way of a shared use arrangement. Private, off-site parking shall only be
applicable to the analysis if a long-term leasing arrangement is proposed to be made.
Shared parking arrangements should be studied thoroughly to determine the
minimum amount of parking required to satisfy the demand from all proposed land
uses during any given time period.
(e) A description of measures that will be implemented to reduce demand for private
automobile use, such as the availability of car-sharing programs and/or incentives for
residents or employees to walk, bicycle, or use public transportation, and estimates
of the anticipated impact of those measures on parking demand.
6.36 Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements. Off street parking shall be provided as
shown in the following table. Where one entry is given in the table, it is the minimum
requirement. All square foot measurements refer to gross floor area unless specified
otherwise. The abbreviation d.u. means dwelling unit. The abbreviation n/a means not
applicable. In cases where a requirement is expressed in number of seats, twenty (20)
6-13
square feet of public floor area shall equal one seat if there are no fixed seats. One
column of the table contains the loading requirement standard applicable under Section
6.80 for each use and two columns refer to the Long-Term Bicycle Parking and Short-
Term Bicycle Parking requirements applicable under Section 6.107 for each use.

to constitute a nuisance, hazard, or unreasonable impediment to traffic.
6.43.1 All parking spaces within the Business B-1 and Business B-2 districts shall be both
covered and enclosed. All vehicle access for office and retail uses in those districts shall
be from Massachusetts Avenue or from a side street perpendicular to it that will allow
traffic flow toward Massachusetts Avenue. The open area of any lot in the Business B-1
and Business B-2 districts devoted to vehicular movements such as driveways shall be not
more than the minimum necessary for vehicular access to covered and enclosed parking.
6.43.2 The layout of parking spaces shall permit entering and exiting without moving any other
vehicles parked in other spaces except where more than one space is provided for any
dwelling unit, such spaces may be located in tandem to the required parking spaces for
that dwelling unit.
6.43.3 Curb cuts for off street parking facilities shall comply with the following standards:
(a) In Residential districts, the maximum width of a curb cut shall be twenty (20) feet at
the street line.

subsections 6.43 in accordance with the following conditions:
(a) The provisions for layout of parking spaces in paragraph 6.43.2 may be modified
where there is a valet parking arrangement for an off street parking facility.
(b) The maximum curb cut width specified in paragraphs 6.43.3 (a) and 6.43.3 (b) may be
modified if the Board determines that an increased curb cut width would facilitate
traffic and safety.
(c) The maximum of one curb cut for every one hundred (100) feet of street frontage as
required in paragraph 6.43.3 (c) may be modified if the Board determines that traffic
and safety would be facilitated by exceeding this maximum.
(d) The distance of driveways from street corners or crosswalks as required in
paragraphs 6.43.4 (b) may be modified if the Board determines that an alternate
arrangement would better facilitate traffic and safety.
6.43.6 The Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit authorizing owners of adjacent
properties to establish common driveways under mutual easements but such special
permit shall not become effective until an appropriate easement has been duly recorded at
the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds.

6.100 BICYCLE PARKING
6.101 Purpose. In order to support the ongoing viability of bicycle travel as a transportation
option that mitigates the impacts of automobile use, the following regulations are provided
to ensure that secure, conveniently accessible bicycle parking is provided in adequate
quantity to serve new development and land uses throughout the city.
6.102 General Terms and Standards for Bicycle Parking
6.102.1 Definition and Use. Bicycle parking, as the term is applied in this Zoning Ordinance, shall
refer to the accessory storage of non-motorized bicycles (which may include trailers or
other customary accessories) in a secure manner that allows for quick and convenient
access, storage and removal of the bicycles by users who are making trips to or from the
associated principal use.
6.102.2 Bicycle parking serving a principal use in accordance with this Article shall be maintained
exclusively for the parking of bicycles, and not for the storage of other objects unrelated to
bicycle use or for other purposes, so long as the use exists which the facilities were
designed to serve. Bicycle parking facilities designed in accordance with this Article shall
6-34
be available for use at all times when the associated principal use is in operation, except
when access may be restricted for necessary maintenance from time to time.
6.102.3 Wherever else in this Zoning Ordinance the term parking is used without specific
reference to bicycle parking, such term shall refer only to parking for motor vehicles and
not to bicycle parking.
6.102.4 Bicycle Parking Spaces. A Bicycle Parking Space shall be defined as an area within which
one intact bicycle may be conveniently and securely stored and removed in an upright
position with both wheels resting upon a stable surface, without requiring the use of a
kickstand, and without requiring the movement of other parked bicycles, vehicles or other
objects to access the space.
6.102.5 Types of Bicycle Parking. Bicycle Parking Spaces may be classified as Long-Term or
Short-Term depending on their characteristics as set forth below.
a. Long-Term Bicycle Parking shall be located within an enclosed, limited-access area
designed so as to protect bicycles from precipitation and from theft. Long-Term Bicycle
Parking shall be intended primarily to serve residents, employees or other persons
who would require storage of a bicycle for a substantial portion of the day, for an
overnight period, or for multiple days; however, it may serve other bicycle users as
needed. Long-Term Bicycle Parking may be provided within the following types of
facilities:
(i) Enclosed spaces within a building, such as bicycle rooms or garages.
(ii) Bicycle sheds, covered bicycle cages, or other enclosed structures designed to
provide secure and fully covered parking for bicycles.
(iii) Bicycle lockers, or fixed-in-place containers into which single bicycles may be
securely stored and protected.
(iv) Weather-protected bicycle parking spaces that are monitored at all times by an
attendant or other security system to prevent unauthorized use or theft.
b. Short-Term Bicycle Parking shall be located in a publicly accessible space near
pedestrian entrances to the uses they are intended to serve. Short-Term Bicycle
Parking shall be intended primarily to serve visitors, such as retail patrons, making
trips of up to a few hours to a particular use; however, it may serve other bicycle users
as needed. Short-Term Bicycle Parking may be provided adjacent to public streets and
sidewalks, or in some cases within the public right of way, as set forth further below in
this Section.
6.103 Applicability of Bicycle Parking Requirements
6.103.1 Bicycle parking requirements shall apply to the following projects, except where exempted
by Subsection 6.103.2 below:
a. The construction of a new building or establishment of a new open-air use on a lot.
6-35
b. An increase of at least fifteen percent (15%) in the number of residential dwelling units
on a lot or in the amount of non-residential Gross Floor Area on a lot from the time of
adoption of this Section 6.100.
c. The conversion of existing Gross Floor Area to a new category of non-residential use,
where such conversion results in at least a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the total
number of bicycle parking spaces that would be required for the entire building by this
Section 6.100.
6.103.2 Notwithstanding the requirements in 6.103.1 above, bicycle parking shall not be required
for the following:
a. Detached one-family or two-family dwellings as set forth in Section 4.31, Paragraphs
(a-c) of this Zoning Ordinance.
b. The enlargement, expansion or conversion of an existing building, where the
difference between the bicycle parking required for the proposed building and the
bicycle parking that would be required for the existing building (under this Section
6.100) equals fewer than two (2) bicycle parking spaces.
c. The enlargement, expansion or conversion of an existing building resulting in a
dwelling containing three (3) or fewer dwelling units.
6.103.3 Where bicycle parking requirements are applicable pursuant to this Section, they shall be
applied to the entirety of any use that is established, expanded or enlarged within a
building or on a lot, and not only to the incremental increase in the intensity of such use.
6.104 Location of Bicycle Parking
6.104.1 Long-Term Bicycle Parking shall be provided within the building containing the use or uses
that it is intended to serve, or within a structure whose pedestrian entrance is no more than
two hundred feet (200) from a pedestrian entrance to such building. Long-Term Bicycle
Parking serving multiple uses or buildings may be pooled into a single area, enclosure or
facility. Where Long-Term Bicycle Parking is located adjacent to motor vehicle parking or
loading facilities, a physical barrier shall be provided to prevent damage to bicycles by
other vehicles.
6.104.2 Short-Term Bicycle Parking shall be located in one of the two following ways:
a. Private Lot. Short-Term Bicycle Parking on a private lot shall be located within fifty feet
(50) feet of a pedestrian entrance to the building or buildings containing the use or
uses it serves. For buildings or uses requiring more than eight (8) Short-Term Bicycle
Parking Spaces, some of the required spaces may be located at a greater distance
from the entrances, so long as eight (8) Short-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces are
available within fifty feet (50) of any entrance.
b. Public Contribution. If Short-Term Bicycle Parking cannot be reasonably provided on
the lot, a property owner may satisfy the requirements for Short-Term Bicycle Parking
by providing funds for the installation of bicycle parking on public land. The City shall
determine the location and design of such bicycle parking, which may include
permanent bicycle racks, seasonal bicycle corrals or other facilities, and may vary from
the standards set forth in this Section 6.100. The City shall have the right to install
bicycle parking on the sidewalk adjacent to the lot, or may choose to retain the funds
6-36
provided in a Public Bicycle Parking Fund to support the installation or replacement of
public bicycle parking at a future time. In either case, prior to issuance of a Certificate
of Occupancy, the property owner shall enter into an agreement with the City which
sets forth the cost of installing the required number of Bicycle Parking Spaces, which
shall be the amount of funds provided by the owner, the timing by which payments are
made, and each partys responsibilities for ongoing maintenance of the facilities, if
applicable.
6.105 Design and Layout of Bicycle Parking. Required bicycle parking shall be provided in some
combination of Bicycle Racks or Bicycle Lockers according to the standards set forth
below. Other design options may be allowed pursuant to Section 6.108 further below.
6.105.1 Bicycle Racks. Long-Term Bicycle Parking or Short-Term Bicycle Parking requirements
may be satisfied by the installation of Bicycle Racks which meet the design and layout
standards set forth in this Subsection. Installers of Bicycle Racks may consult the City of
Cambridge Bicycle Parking Guide, 2008 or later version, for illustrations of acceptable
Bicycle Rack design and layout.
a. A Bicycle Rack shall mean a fixed-in-place stand, solidly anchored to the ground or
other fixed object, which allows a bicycle to lean against it in an upright position with
both wheels on a level surface. A bicycle shall make contact with the stand at two (2)
points along the length of the bicycle and shall allow one or both wheels to be locked
to the stand by way of a cable, chain, U-lock or shackle. Types of permissible Bicycle
Racks include, but are not necessarily limited to, those commonly known as Inverted
U-shape, Swerve and Post-and-Ring racks. Stands commonly known as Wave
Racks do not meet the standards for Bicycle Racks set forth herein.
b. Each Bicycle Rack, if designed to the spacing requirements set forth herein, may
provide up to two Bicycle Parking Spaces, with one Bicycle Parking Space provided on
each side of the Bicycle Rack. If a Bicycle Rack meets the spacing requirements on
one side of the stand but not the other (as may be the case where a Bicycle Rack is
attached to a wall), then it may provide one Bicycle Parking Space,
c. A single interconnected structure may provide parking for more than two bicycles, in
which case the term Bicycle Rack as applied in this Ordinance shall refer to any
vertical element of the structure upon which one or two bicycles may be secured and
which otherwise meets the layout standards set forth herein.
d. To provide adequate space to store and remove a standard bicycle, there shall be at
least three feet (3) clear horizontal distance from the center point of the Bicycle Rack
in a direction perpendicular to the length of the bicycle, and at least four feet (4) clear
horizontal distance from the center point of the Bicycle Rack in each direction parallel
to the length of the bicycle.
e. Where twenty (20) or more Bicycle Parking Spaces are required, at least five percent
(5%) of the required spaces must provide an additional two feet (2) of space parallel to
the length of the bicycle to accommodate tandem bicycles or bicycles with trailers.
f. Bicycle Racks shall generally be arranged either in rows (where bicycles are parked
side-to-side) or in alignment (where bicycles are parked end-to-end). Where Bicycle
Racks are arranged in rows, they shall be spaced at least three feet (3) apart on6-
37
center. Where Bicycle Racks are arranged in alignment, they shall be spaced at least
eight feet (8) on-center.
g. In addition to the requirements set forth herein, all Bicycle Racks shall conform to any
applicable federal, state or local requirements for accessibility by disabled persons.
6.105.2 Bicycle Lockers. Long-Term Bicycle Parking or Short-Term Bicycle Parking requirements
may be satisfied by the installation of Bicycle Lockers which meet the design and layout
standards set forth in this subsection.
a. A Bicycle Locker shall mean an enclosed, lockable structure which a single user may
open and close for the purpose of storing one or more bicycles. Although a Bicycle
Locker is allowed to store more than one bicycle, for the purpose of meeting the
requirements of this Section 6.100, a single-use Bicycle Locker may provide only one
Bicycle Parking Space. A lockable structure may provide more than one Bicycle
Parking Space only if it contains Bicycle Racks designed in accordance with the
requirements of 6.105.1 above.
b. A Bicycle Locker shall be secured by means of a lockable door or an object inside the
Bicycle Locker to which the bicycle frame and one or both wheels may be secured by
way of a cable, chain, U-lock or shackle.
c. A Bicycle Locker must allow for a bicycle to stand upright within the locker without
requiring the use of a kickstand.
d. To accommodate a standard bicycle, a Bicycle Locker must provide an interior space
at least two feet (2) in width and six feet (6) in length. However, as provided in
6.105.1(d) above, where twenty (20) or more Bicycle Parking Spaces are required, at
least five percent (5%) of the required spaces must accommodate an additional two
feet (2) of bicycle length to accommodate tandem bicycles or bicycles with trailers.
e. In addition to the requirements set forth herein, all Bicycle Lockers shall conform to
any applicable federal, state or local requirements for accessibility by disabled
persons.
6.105.3 Unacceptable Bicycle Parking Designs. Bicycle Parking Spaces shall not be deemed to
meet the requirements of this Section 6.100 if any of the following are true:
a. Bicycles must be stored lying down or require a kickstand to remain upright.
b. Bicycles must be hung with one or both wheels suspended in the air.
c. Bicycles must be lifted off of the ground or floor without any physical assistance
provided.
Otherwise, flexibility in the design of bicycle parking shall be allowed pursuant to the
provisions for modification by special permit as set forth in Section 6.108 below. Such
modifications shall allow for consideration of new or innovative technologies that provide
equal or greater convenience and accessibility to bicyclists when compared to facilities
designed according to the Bicycle Parking Guide standards.
6.106 Access Standards for Bicycle Parking
6.106.1 Primary Access. All Bicycle Parking Spaces must be accessible by way of at least one
clear, stabilized-surface access route. Such access route shall connect to the Bicycle
Parking Spaces from any point or points along the public right of way from which bicyclists
6-38
would be reasonably expected to approach the site, and shall meet the following additional
requirements:
a. The primary access route must be at least five (5) feet in width.
b. If there is a change in grade from the public right-of-way to the Bicycle Parking
Spaces, then the primary access route must have a slope no greater than five percent
(5%), or may have a slope of no greater than eight percent (8%) if level landings are
provided at every thirty (30) feet of linear distance; or access may be provided by
means of an elevator with minimum interior dimensions of eighty (80) inches by fiftyfour
(54) inches.
c. The primary access route must not require lifting bicycles over any steps or stairs.
d. All access routes must be clear of obstructions, which shall include Bicycle Parking
Spaces, motor vehicle parking spaces and loading spaces; however, doors or gates
that must be opened to access the Bicycle Parking Spaces shall not be considered
obstructions so long as they may be conveniently opened and closed by bicycle users.
e. All access routes, along with the Bicycle Parking Spaces themselves, must be
appropriately lighted to allow for safe nighttime use.
6.106.2 Additional Access. So long as there is at least one primary access route meeting the
requirements set forth in Section 6.106.1 above, Bicycle Parking Spaces may be accessed
secondarily by routes that do not meet those exact requirements, such as parking garage
entrance ramps or stairways with adjacent flat stairway channels along at least one edge
of the stairway. However, all access routes must be clear of obstructions as set forth in
6.106.1(d) above.
6.107 Required Quantities of Bicycle Parking
6.107.1 Minimum Number of Bicycle Parking Spaces. The required quantities of Long-Term
Bicycle Parking Spaces and Short-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces shall be calculated by
independently applying the minimum rates set forth in the Schedule of Long-Term Bicycle
Parking Requirements and the Schedule of Short-Term Bicycle Parking Requirements
below. Each rate shall be multiplied by the intensity of the applicable land use or uses,
measured in Gross Floor Area, number of dwelling units, or other specified unit of
measurement. Wherever the application of such rate results in a fractional value, such
fraction shall be considered one required Bicycle Parking Space. The total number of
Bicycle Parking Spaces required shall be the sum of the required Long-Term Bicycle
Parking Spaces and Short-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces. Any Bicycle Parking Space that
meets the requirements for both Long-Term Bicycle Parking and Short-Term Bicycle
Parking may contribute to the minimum requirement for one type or the other, but not both.
6.107.2 Schedule of Long-Term Bicycle Parking Requirements. Minimum rates of Long-Term
Bicycle Parking shall apply to specified categories of land use as set forth below. For
specific land uses, the following categories are cross-referenced in the Schedule of
Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Section 6.36 of this Zoning Ordinance. In
the case of any inconsistency between the list of included uses as set forth below and the
categorization set forth in Section 6.36, the categorization in Section 6.36 shall control.

Term Bicycle Parking Spaces or four (4) spaces, whichever is greater, may be
converted to Short-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces.
b. For residential uses requiring four (4) Long-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces or fewer, the
required Long-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces may be designed to meet the
requirements for Short-Term Bicycle Parking Spaces, so long as they are covered to
6-41
be protected from precipitation and are located on the same lot as the residential uses
they serve.
6.108 Modification of Requirements by Special Permit
6.108.1 Any requirement set forth in this Section 6.100 may be modified upon the granting of a
special permit by the Planning Board. Given that community standards for bicycle use and
bicycle parking have evolved and may continue to evolve in the future, the intent of this
provision is to provide a mechanism for the review and approval of alternative technologies
and methods for providing bicycle parking that may provide equal or greater benefits to
bicycle users but may not conform to the exact requirements set forth in this Section.
6.108.2 Bicycle Parking Plan Requirements. When seeking a special permit pursuant to this
Section 6.108, the Applicant shall provide a Bicycle Parking Plan as part of the Special
Permit Application. Such plan shall include the proposed quantities and locations of bicycle
parking facilities as well as exact details and specifications of the design and layout of
proposed Bicycle Parking Spaces. The Bicycle Parking Plan shall include a narrative listing
the requirements that are proposed to be modified and explaining how the Bicycle Parking
Plan would benefit from such modifications. The Bicycle Parking Plan may also include
quantitative analyses of expected bicycle usage for the proposed land uses.
6.108.3 Findings and Approval. Upon granting a special permit to modify any requirements of this
Section 6.100, the Planning Board shall make a general determination that the proposal is
consistent with the purpose of this Section 6.100 and that the Bicycle Parking Plan
proposes a quantity, design and arrangement of bicycle parking that will serve bicycle
users in a way that is sufficiently comparable, given the circumstances of the specific
project, to the bicycle parking that would be required under the regulations of this Section
6.100. The Planning Board shall also make specific determinations applicable to the
modifications being sought as set forth below:
a. Where an alternative design or layout of Bicycle Parking Spaces is proposed, the
Planning Board shall determine that such design or layout shall be durable and
convenient for the users whom it is intended to serve. Where new technologies are
proposed, the Board may require that the Applicant demonstrate such technologies for
review by City staff.
b. Where modifications to the location or quantity of bicycle parking is proposed, the
Planning Board shall determine that the Bicycle Parking Plan will satisfactorily serve
the needs of all expected users, based on quantitative and/or qualitative evidence
provided by the Applicant. Such a modification may be appropriate for a campus
master plan or other large development site within which bicycle parking is planned
comprehensively across an area instead of on a specific site-by-site basis.

7.10 SIGNS
7.11 Findings and Purpose
7.11.1 Findings
This Article is based upon the following findings:
A. The City of Cambridge has been and is now taking appropriate action, through
exercise of its zoning and other municipal authority, to improve the aesthetics and
physical appearance of the City by means including the regulation of signs.
B. The regulation of signs is necessary in order to preserve and enhance the
substantial governmental interests of the City of Cambridge in its natural, scenic,
historic, cultural, and aesthetic qualities.
C. There is a substantial governmental interest in enhancing the physical appearance of
all parts of the City of Cambridge, including residential, commercial, and industrial
areas.
D. Regulating signs will improve the City's appearance; make the City's commercial,
residential, and industrial areas more attractive for commercial and residential uses
and commercial development; and enhance the economic climate of the City.
E. The regulations set forth in this Article will directly advance the public interest in
aesthetics and other qualities of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of
residential, commercial and industrial buildings and areas; preserving and enhancing
the appearance of public streets, parks and other public properties; and minimizing
the intrusiveness of sign structures.
F. Nonconforming off-premise signs, which traditionally have been used primarily to
advertise commercial goods and services not available on the same premises, have
a significantly greater adverse aesthetic impact than on premises signs because of
their larger sizes, greater heights, less attractive appearances, and/or more intrusive
locations.
G. The public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify
their premises, or the products or services there available, or to display
noncommercial messages.
H. The City finds that it is in the City's interest to require removal of certain
nonconforming signs after the grace period provided by Section 7.18 has expired.
I. The City in enacting this ordinance does hereby adopt the findings, conclusions, and
recommendations of the Planning Board in its report dated March 7, 1991.

with the effective date and removal schedule set forth in Section 7.18.1. Therefore,
should any part of the City's Ordinance be declared invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then it is the specific intent of the City that the remainder of the Ordinance not
specifically declared invalid shall continue in full force and effect as if and when originally
enacted by the City.

in violation of the dimensional requirements of Article 5.000 or the off street parking
and loading requirements in Article 6.000 for the district in which such structure is
located and provided such nonconforming structure will not be increased in area or
volume by more than twenty-five (25) percent since it first began to be
nonconforming.
8.22.3 Any alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure or of a nonconforming use not
otherwise permitted in Section 8.22.1 and 8.22.2 above shall be a variance.
8.23 If a nonconforming structure or use shall have been destroyed or damaged by fire,
explosion or other catastrophe (except one that has been determined by the City to have
been caused intentionally by or on behalf of the owner), such structure may be rebuilt or
restored and used again as previously. If a nonconforming structure or use shall have
been destroyed, damaged, or caused to be moved as the result of a public taking, said
structure or use may be relocated or reconstructed on the lot or on an abutting lot in the
same ownership, provided that said relocation or reconstruction does not result in the
enlargement of the nonconforming use or structure. In either case, the rebuilding,
8-4
restoring, relocation or reconstruction shall not require a special permit provided that it
commences within twenty-four (24) months after such fire, explosion, catastrophe, public
taking, or April 24, 2017 (the date of enactment of this amendment), whichever is later,
and is completed within thirty-six (36) months after such fire, explosion, catastrophe,
public taking, or April 24, 2017 (the date of enactment of this amendment), whichever is
later, and provided that the structure as rebuilt, restored, relocated, or reconstructed shall
not be greater in volume, footprint, or gross floor area, shall not further increase any
nonconformities than those of the original nonconforming structure, and shall not further
violate any dimensional requirements of the Ordinance.
8.24 A nonconforming use of a building or land which has been abandoned or not used for a
period of two years shall not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned when the intent of the owner to
discontinue use is apparent, or when the use has been discontinued for a period of thirty
(30) days, or when the characteristic equipment and furnishings of the nonconforming use
have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar equipment,
whichever shall first occur.
8.25 Construction or operation under a building or special permit shall conform to any
subsequent amendment of this Ordinance unless the use or construction is commenced
within a period of six months after the issuance of the permit and in cases involving
construction, unless such construction is continued through to completion as continuously
and expeditiously as is reasonable.

9.20 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
9.10 ENFORCEMENT
9.11 The Superintendent of Buildings of the City of Cambridge is hereby designated and
authorized as the officer charged with the enforcement of this Ordinance.
9.12 From the time of the effective date of this Ordinance the Superintendent of Buildings shall
not grant a permit for the construction or alteration of any building or structure if such
construction or alteration would be in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance
whether by the applicant for the permit or by any other party associated with the property
involved; nor shall any municipal officer grant any permit or license for the use of any
building or land if such use would be in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance.
No building permit or certificate of occupancy or other permit or license shall be issued for
land or for a building or structure to be erected on land which at the time of application is
dedicated to the provision of off street parking as required by this Ordinance, unless such
new construction or use shall continue to make available the required number of off street
parking spaces in addition to the off street parking facilities required for such new
construction or use, or unless substitute parking facilities which meet the requirements of
Article 6.000 have been first provided. In the event of doubt whether a building permit or
certificate of occupancy should be issued in any particular case the Superintendent of
Buildings shall deny the application therefore.
9.13 Whenever such permit is refused, because of the violation of some provision of this
Ordinance the reason for such refusal shall be clearly stated in writing.
9.14 Every applicant for a building permit for any construction, alteration, or use of any building
or land for which a permit is required by law shall, upon request of the Superintendent of
Buildings, file such written information, plans, specifications, or other data as shall be
deemed necessary for the full and accurate exposition of the proposed construction,
alteration or use with relation to the regulations of this Ordinance. Such material shall be
kept on file in the records of the Office of Superintendent of Buildings.
9.15 The Superintendent of Buildings, upon accurate information in writing from any citizen, or
upon his own initiative, shall institute any appropriate action or proceedings in the name of
the City of Cambridge to prevent, correct, restrain, or abate violations of this Ordinance.
Any person aggrieved by a violation of any portion of this Ordinance may request in
writing that the Superintendent of Buildings enforce the Ordinance. The Superintendent
shall notify, in writing, the party requesting such enforcement of any action or refusal to
act, and the reasons therefore, within fourteen days of receipt of such request.
9.16 (1) Criminal Penalty. Any person, firm or corporation who violates or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this Ordinance may, upon conviction, be fined a sum not to
9-2
exceed three hundred dollars for each offense. Each day, or portion of a day, that any
violation is allowed to continue shall constitute a separate offense.
(2) Noncriminal Disposition. Whoever violates any provision of this ordinance may be
penalized by a non-criminal disposition as provided in G. L. c. 40, Section 21D. For
purposes of this section, the Commissioner of Inspectional Services and his or her
designee shall be the enforcing officer. The penalty for each violation shall not exceed
three hundred dollars. Each days violation shall constitute a separate violation.
9.17 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, the requirements contained
herein are declared to be the minimum requirements for the purposes set forth. This
Ordinance shall not nullify the more restrictive provisions of covenants, agreements, other
ordinances or laws, but shall prevail notwithstanding such provisions which are less
restrictive.
9.20 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
9.21 No land shall be occupied or used, and no building or structure erected or structurally
altered after January 25, 1944, shall be occupied or used, in whole or in part, for any
purpose until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Superintendent of
Buildings stating that the building and use comply with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Cambridge and of the State Building Code in effect at the time of
issuance. No such certificate shall be issued unless the building and its use and its
accessory uses and the uses of all premises are in conformance with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance and of the State Building Code at the time of issuance. Where a
certificate of occupancy was not issued at the time of occupancy or use permitted by the
Zoning Ordinance and State Building Code in effect at such time began, the
Superintendent of Buildings may issue a validating certificate of occupancy retroactive to
the beginning of the occupancy of use. A certificate of occupancy shall be conditional on
the adequacy of parking space and other facilities as required by this Ordinance and shall
lapse if such space or spaces facilities are used for other purposes.
9.22 A certificate of occupancy shall be required for any of the following in conformity with the
State Building Code and the Zoning Ordinance:
(a) Occupancy and use of a building hereafter erected or structurally altered.
(b) Change in use of an existing building to a use of a different classification.
(c) Change in character or the intensity of the use of land.
(d) Any change in use of a nonconforming structure or use.
9.23 In cases where a building permit is required, a certificate of occupancy shall be applied for
at the time of the application for a building permit, and shall be issued within ten days
after the lawful erection or alteration of the building is completed if the proposed use of
the building is permitted by this Ordinance. In cases where a building permit is not
required a certificate of occupancy shall be applied for prior to the happening of any of the
events specified in Section 9.22 and shall be issued prior to any such change of use.
Such certificates of occupancy shall be posted forthwith by the owner of the property in a
9-3
conspicuous place on the premises involved for a period of not less than ten days after
issuance.
9.24 Pending the issuance of a regular certificate of occupancy, a temporary certificate may be
issued for such period as the Superintendent may designate, but not beyond the
completion of the project described in the application for the building permit, provided
there is compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance corresponding to the
extent of occupancy.
9.25 The Superintendent of Buildings may issue a certificate of occupancy for a nonconforming
use which is substituted for an existing nonconforming use of the same type (e.g. retail
store for retail store, restaurant for lunch room) and for a nonconforming use which is
substituted for an existing nonconforming use where such substitute use is permitted in
Article 4.000 as a matter of right in the the most restricted Residence district in which a
similar such existing nonconforming use is permitted; provided there is no enlargement of
volume or area and provided such substitution does not occasion any further violation of
applicable regulations of this ordinance.

10.30 VARIANCES
10.31 A variance from the specific requirements of this Ordinance, including variances for
use, may be authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeal with respect to particular land
or structure. Such variance shall be granted only in cases where the Board finds all of
the following:
(a) a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would involve a substantial
hardship, financial or otherwise to the petitioner or appellant.
10-3
(b) The hardship is owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape or
topography of such land or structures and especially affecting such land or
structure but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located.
(c) Desirable relief may be granted without either:
(1) substantial detriment to the public good; or
(2) nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this
Ordinance.
10.32 In addition to considering the character and use of nearby buildings and land the
Board, in determining its finding, shall take into account the number of persons
residing or working in such buildings or upon such land, and the present and probable
future traffic conditions. The Board shall also take into account the potential impact of
the development to be authorized by the variance on Registered Solar Energy
Systems as defined in Section 22.60 of this Zoning Ordinance.
10.33 A variance shall be granted only after a public hearing for which notice has been given
by publication and posting as provided in Section 11, Chapter 40A, G.L., and by the
installation of on-site notification panels as required in Section 10.42.1. In any of the
following cases notice of each application to the Board of Zoning Appeal for a variance
shall be transmitted forthwith to the Planning Board which shall within twenty (20) days
of the receipt of such notice transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeal a report
accompanied by any material, maps, or plans that will aid the latter Board in judging
the applications and in determining special conditions and safeguards. The Board of
Zoning Appeal shall not render any decision on an application for a variance until said
report has been received and considered, or until the twenty (20) day period has
expired without receipt of the report whichever is earlier.
(a) Erection or alteration of a building to a height greater than that otherwise
authorized under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(b) A change involving a nonconforming use of land in excess of twenty thousand
(20,000) square feet.
(c) A change involving a nonconforming use of an existing building or building with a
gross floor area in excess of two thousand (2,000) square feet or a floor area ratio
more than fifty (50) percent greater than that permitted in the district in which it is
located.
(d) A change involving a commercial or industrial use on a lot not previously used for a
commercial or industrial purpose.
(e) Any other application for a variance with respect to which the Planning Board
certified the Board of Zoning Appeal not later than the date of the public hearing
that the granting of such application would materially conflict with the planning
principles and policies adopted by the Planning Board.
10.34 In granting a variance the Board may attach such conditions, safeguards, and
limitations of time, use and other development features, such as those listed in Section
10-4
10.44, as are determined necessary to protect the surrounding neighborhood including
the continued existence of any particular structure, but excluding any conditions,
safeguards or limitations based upon the continued ownership of the land or structures
to which the variance pertains by the applicant, petitioner or any owner.
10.35 If the rights authorized by a variance are not exercised within one year of the date of
granting of such variance, they shall lapse and may be reestablished only after notice
and new hearing pursuant to this Section 10.30.
10.40 SPECIAL PERMITS
10.41 Granting Authority. Special permits may be granted for the Board of Zoning Appeal or
by the Planning Board as specified elsewhere in this Ordinance. Each of said boards
shall be considered a special permit granting authority.
10.42 Procedure. A special permit shall only be issued following a public hearing held within
sixty-five (65) days after filing of an application with the special permit granting
authority, a copy of which shall be given to the City Clerk by the applicant. Notice of
each application to the Board of Zoning Appeal for a special permit shall be transmitted
forthwith to the Planning Board which shall, within thirty-five (35) days of the receipt of
such notice transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeal a report accompanied by any
material, maps, or plans that will aid the latter Board in judging the application and in
determining special conditions and safeguards. The Board of Zoning Appeal shall not
render any decision on an application for a special permit until said report has been
received and considered or until the thirty-five (35) day period has expired without
receipt of the report, whichever is earlier. Failure by a special permit granting authority
to take final action upon an application for a special permit within ninety (90) days
following the date of public hearing on said application shall be deemed to be a grant
of the permit applied for.
10.42.1 Additional Notification Requirements. Any applicant for a variance or special permit
shall be required to erect and maintain in legible condition one or more public
notification panels at the site for which the variance or special permit relief is
requested. The required panels shall be secured by the applicant from the Department
of Inspectional Services for those permits issued by the Board of Zoning Appeal and
shall be secured from the Community Development Department for those permits
issued by the Planning Board. The location of any required panel shall be located on a
site plan included in the application documents, which location or locations shall be
subject to the approval of those respective departments; the mechanics of its
installation shall be described in those application documents. The following
requirements shall apply:
(a) Location and Number. Panels shall be securely mounted on the subject lot at the
street line or within the property, but in any case not more than twenty (20) feet
from the street line. However, wherever located, the panel(s) shall be visible,
easily identifiable, and legible to persons passing by on the public street, without
the necessity of trespass onto private property. For lots having street frontage of
two hundred (200) feet or less, one panel shall be installed, One additional panel
10-5
shall be installed for each additional five hundred (500) feet of street frontage. The
panels shall be exempt from any applicable limitation on accessory signs set forth
in Article 7.000.
(b) Schedule and Duration. The required panels shall be installed as required in this
Section 10.42.1 not less than fourteen (14) days before the date of the public
hearing. They shall be maintained in legible condition until a Notice of Decision
has been filed with the City Clerk by the permit or special permit granting authority.
Panels that are stolen, destroyed, or rendered illegible shall be promptly replaced,
and panels shall be promptly removed after the Notice of Decision has been filed.
(c) Contents of Panels. The text of the panel shall generally contain the name of the
petitioner; a description of the area or premises; street address or other
information adequate to identify the location or area subject of the permit petition;
the date, time and place of the public hearing; the subject matter of the hearing;
the nature of the action or relief requested; the place where the full application may
be inspected; case number of the application; the place where written comments
may be directed; the phone number of the municipal agency or contact person
where further information may be obtained. Reasonable modifications of the text
requirements of this paragraph c shall be permitted to enable the most important
information to be provided in the most legible form.
(d) Graphic and Construction Standards. Panels shall not be less than eighteen (18)
inches by twenty-four (24) inches in dimension; they may be larger. No text on the
panel shall be smaller than 12 point type. Panels shall be made of materials
adequately weather resistant and durable for the time they are required to be
posted.
10.43 Criteria. Special permits will normally be granted where specific provisions of this
Ordinance are met, except when particulars of the location or use, not generally true of
the district or of the uses permitted in it, would cause granting of such permit to be to
the detriment of the public interest because:
(a) It appears that requirements of this Ordinance cannot or will not be met, or
(b) traffic generated or patterns of access or egress would cause congestion, hazard,
or substantial change in established neighborhood character, or
(c) the continued operation of or the development of adjacent uses as permitted in the
Zoning Ordinance would be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use,
or
(d) nuisance or hazard would be created to the detriment of the health, safety and/or
welfare of the occupant of the proposed use or the citizens of the City, or
(e) for other reasons, the proposed use would impair the integrity of the district or
adjoining district, or otherwise derogate from the intent and purpose of this
Ordinance, and
(f) the new use or building construction is inconsistent with the Urban Design
Objectives set forth in Section 19.30.
10-6
10.44 Conditions. In acting upon special permits the special permit granting authority shall
take into account the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and, in order to
preserve community values, may impose conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary to protect the surrounding neighborhood, in addition to the applicable
requirements of this Ordinance, such as, but not limited to, the following:
(a) Front, side or rear yards greater than the minimum required by this Ordinance.
(b) Screening of parking areas or other parts of the premises from adjoining premises
or from the street by specified walls, fences, planting, or other devices.

required by this or other applicable codes or regulations.
(g) Control of the number, location, size and lighting of signs.
10.45 Any development application requiring a special permit from the Planning Board that
contains elements requiring a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal may be
allowed by the Planning Board within the scope of the Planning Board special permit
and shall not require a separate application to the Board of Zoning Appeal.
10.46 Expiration. A special permit granted under this section shall lapse within two years, not
including such time required to pursue or await the determination of an appeal to the
Superior Court or to the Land Court as provided in Section 10.22 from the grant
thereof, if a substantial use thereof has not sooner commenced except for good cause
or, in the case of a permit for construction, if construction was not begun by such date
except for good cause.
10.47 Procedure for Townhouses and Multifamily Dwellings. An application for a special
permit for a townhouse development or for a multifamily dwelling required by Section
4.31 shall also meet the requirements of this Subsection 10.47. Where this
Subsection and Subsection 10.42 are in conflict, this Subsection shall control.
10.47.1 Applications for special permits shall be accompanied by three copies of a
development plan containing the following graphic and written information:
(1) An accurately scaled map showing the existing conditions on the parcel on which
development is proposed and on lots abutting or directly across any street from
said parcel. Said map shall indicate property lines, existing structures and all trees
in excess of 3" caliper.
(2) Information concerning current land use of said parcels (including the number of
existing dwelling units).
(3) Photographs showing conditions on the development parcel at the time of
application and showing structures on abutting lots.
10-7
(4) A site plan of the development parcel, drawn to scale, showing proposed lot
subdivision, if any, the location of proposed buildings, retained and proposed
vegetation, location of parking spaces, driveways, proposed curb cuts and
walkways, proposed treatment of the perimeter of the parcel including techniques
and materials used (screens, fences, walls) and the location of required private
open space.
(5) Front, side and rear elevations for each structure on the lot indicating building
height and heights of buildings on abutting lots.
(6) Quantitative data on the proposed development including floor area ratio, floor
area per unit, number of bedrooms and the amount of private open space
allocated to each unit and reserved for common use of the residents.
(7) A list of any zoning violations which would customarily require variances from the
requirements of this Ordinance.
(8) A Tree Study, certified complete by the City Arborist, as required by the Tree
Protection Ordinance of the City of Cambridge, Chapter 8.66.
10.47.2 No application shall be accepted by the Planning Board until all of the information
required in Subsection 10.47.1 is completed and included in the development plan.
Any changes in the development plan by the applicant following submittal of the
application, other than those which might be negotiated at the pubic hearing, shall
require resubmittal of an application for a special permit.
10.47.3 Upon receipt of the application and development plans, the Planning Board shall
transmit forthwith one copy of the plan to the Traffic Department. Within forty-five (45)
days of receipt of the plan, the Traffic Department shall review said plan and submit a
report and recommendation on the development proposal to the Planning Board. The
Planning Board shall not render any decision on an application for a special permit for
a townhouse development or for a multifamily dwelling subject to those requirements
until said report has been received and considered or until the forty-five (45) day period
has expired without the receipt of such report, which ever is earlier.
10.47.4 Criteria for approval of Townhouses and Multifamily Dwellings. In reviewing
applications for townhouse developments and multifamily dwelling, the special permit
granting authority shall consider and address the following site plan criteria as
applicable:
(1) Key features of the natural landscape should be preserved to the maximum extent
feasible. Tree removal should be minimized and other natural features of the site,
such as slopes, should be maintained.
(2) New buildings should be related sensitively to the existing built environment. The
location, orientation and massing of structures in the development should avoid
overwhelming the existing buildings in the vicinity of the development. Visual and
functional disruptions should be avoided.
10-8
(3) The location, arrangement, and landscaping of open space should provide some
visual benefits to abutters and passersby as well as functional benefits to
occupants of the development.
(4) Parking areas, internal roadways and access/egress points should be safe and
convenient.
(5) Parking area landscaping should minimize the intrusion of onsite parking so that it
does not substantially detract from the use and enjoyment of either the proposed
development or neighboring properties.
(6) Service facilities such as trash collection apparatus and utility boxes should be
located so that they are convenient for resident, yet unobtrusive.
10.47.41 Additional Criteria for Townhouses and Multifamily Dwellings in Industry A and A-2
districts, Industry B, B-1 and B-2 districts, and the Industry C district. In addition to the
criteria set forth in Section 11.47.4 above, the following shall be considered by the
Planning Board in these industrial districts:
(1) On balance the location is appropriate for the proposed residential uses, because:
(a) Residential use at the proposed location will not preempt space particularly
suitable for nonresidential uses; and
(b) Existing or anticipated uses on nearby premises will not make residential use
inappropriate because of external impacts such as noise, glare, odors or
safety concerns; and
(c) The proximity of the proposal to other residential development or reasonably
anticipated residential development in the future, helps to establish an amount
of housing sufficient to ensure a viable, supportive and healthy residential
environment; or

11.10 TOWNHOUSE DEVELOPMENT
11.11 Statement of Purpose. This Section 11.10 has been adopted to encourage the
development of one and two family townhouses. The townhouse development use
created herein is intended to promote development designs that are compatible with
traditional neighborhood development patterns and sensitive to existing streetscapes,
to encourage a townhouse pattern of development where higher densities are
permitted and to discourage the demolition of existing residential structures as well as
the excessive infill of townhouses on lots already containing residential structures.
Provisions for the townhouse development use are intended to overcome obstacles to
the development of one and two family townhouses, by providing special incentives
where appropriate. This section provides guidelines for both as of right and townhouse
developments which require special permit review. The distinction allows for
expeditious review and approvals for smaller scale infill townhouse developments,
while ensuring detailed examination of the site and building plans for larger
developments and consideration of their neighborhood impacts.
11.12 Applicability of Regulations. The development standards specified in this Section
11.10 are applicable only to townhouse developments and do not change the
development standards for other uses in the Residence, Office and Business, and
Industry A-1 districts. Townhouse developments which meet the requirements
specified in Sections 11.14, 11.15, and 11.16 shall be allowed in Residence B, C, C-1,
11-2
C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, C-3B, Office and Business and Industry A-1
districts as follows:
11.12.1 Construction of a townhouse development containing six (6) or more dwelling units in a
Residence B district and Residence C district shall require a special permit.
11.12.2 Construction of a townhouse development containing twelve (12) or more dwelling
units in a Residence C-1, Residence C-1A, Office 1, Office 2, Business A-1, Industry
A-1 or Business A-3 district shall require a special permit.
11.12.3 Construction of a townhouse development in a Residence B, C, C-1, Residence C-1A,
Office 1, Business A-1 or Business A-3 district which contains fewer units than
specified in Section 11.12.1 or 11.12.2 shall require a special permit if both of the
following conditions pertain to the development:
(1) another permit for townhouse development has been granted within the twelve
(12) month period immediately preceding the date of permit application for the lot
on which the development would be located or on an abutting lot;
(2) the townhouse development for which the permit is being sought would increase
the total number of dwelling units on said lot(s) to the threshold specified in Section
11.12.1 or 11.12.2.
11.12.4 Construction of all townhouse development in Industry A and A-2 districts, Industry B,
B-1 and B-2 district, and the Industry C district shall require a special permit granted by
the Planning Board where any one of the following conditions exist:
1) The development exceeds fifty thousand (50,000) square feet of gross floor area;
2) The lot area per dwelling unit proposed is less than one thousand two hundred
(1,200) square feet in an Industry C district six hundred (600) square feet in an
Industry A district, or three hundred (300) square feet in an Industry A-2, Industry
B, or Industry B-1 district; or
3) Twelve units or more dwelling units are proposed where any portion of the
development is located within one hundred (100) feet or a Residence A-1, A-2, B,
C, or C-1 district.
11.12.5 Where a townhouse development is constructed on two or more abutting lots, the
requirements applicable to the development shall be determined as if the parcel were a
single lot.
11.12.6 Where a townhouse development is constructed on a lot or lots with other buildings
existing prior to such development, the dimensional requirements of this Section 11.10
shall apply to those structures or portions of structures on the lot(s) which constitute
the townhouse development.
11.12.7 Where a townhouse development is proposed on a lot on which a preferably preserved
significant building, as determined by the Cambridge Historical Commission under the
11-3
provisions of the Demolition Ordinance #965, has been demolished within the five (5)
years immediately preceding the application for a building permit or a special permit or
where such building is proposed to be demolished to permit the townhouse
development under the provisions of this Section 11.10, the provisions of Subsections
11.14, 11.15, and 11.15.1 - 11.15.4 shall not apply; the townhouse development shall
in such circumstances be subject to the dimensional requirements normally applicable
in the district.
11.13 Special Permit Granting Authority. The Planning Board shall be the special permit
granting authority for any townhouse development included in Section 11.12.1,
11.12.2, or 11.12.3. The Board of Zoning Appeal shall be the special permit granting
authority for special permits required by Sections 11.15.5, 11.16.2, and 11.16.4 for any
townhouse development which does not require a special permit from the Planning
Board.
11.14 Subdivided Lots. A developer, or any subsequent owner, who desires to subdivide a
townhouse development must record a subdivision plan with the Registry of Deeds of
Middlesex County. A copy of the recorded subdivision plan must also be filed with the
Building Commissioner. Subdivided lots may be less than five thousand (5,000)
square feet and must include an individual dwelling, together with front and rear yards
or rights to yards in common areas.
11.15 Dimensional Standards for Townhouse Development. The following development
controls apply to the parcel of land upon which a townhouse development is
constructed and are not applicable to the initial subdivision of the townhouse parcel
into individual lots. The townhouse development parcel as a whole must conform to
these controls. But once satisfied for the total parcel, the controls are waived for the
subsequent subdivision into individual lots. The required minimum lot size for a
townhouse development shall conform to the existing regulations for the district in
which the townhouse development is constructed.
However, modifications to the townhouse development after a subdivision plan has
been recorded in the Registry of Deeds shall be subject to the dimensional standards
as set forth in this Section 11.15 applied to the individual lot lines of the subdivided lots;
modifications that do not so conform may be permitted as set forth below:
a. For any townhouse development, after issuance of a building permit, projecting
eaves, chimneys, bay windows, and balconies that do not project more than three
and one half (3 1/2) feet.
b. For any townhouse development for which a special permit has been granted by
the Planning Board, modifications specifically enumerated in the special permit.
For those modifications not so enumerated, or where the special permit fails to
specifically enumerate allowed modifications, after issuance of a new special
permit (a Major Amendment to the original special permit) by the Planning Board to
allow the proposed modification(s).
11-4
c. For any townhouse development originally constructed as of right, after issuance
of a special permit by the Board of Zoning Appeal.
Where a special permit is required in paragraphs b. and c. above, all owners of lots
that together constitute the original townhouse development parcel shall receive notice
of the special permit public hearing, in the manner provided for in Chapter 40A for
parties of interest; such owners shall be considered parties in interest, however, only
as they are so defined in Section 11, Chapter 40A.
11.15.1 Minimum Lot Width. In a townhouse development there shall be no minimum lot width,
except that in Residence B, Residence C, and Residence C-1 districts the minimum lot
width applicable in the district shall apply.
11.15.2 Maximum Floor Area Ratio. In a townhouse development, the maximum permitted
floor area ratio in districts where townhouse developments are permitted shall be as
normally applicable in the district.
11.15.3 Maximum Height. In a townhouse development the maximum permitted height shall
be four habitable stories and the maximum height of the cornice line shall be thirty (30)
feet. Any part of a townhouse structure which projects above the cornice line shall be
set below an imaginary inclined plane beginning at the thirty (30) foot cornice line on
any facade of the structure facing a street or facing any lot line abutting a residentially
zoned lot, and thereafter rising at a forty-five degree (45°) angle. However, portions of
the building may rise above the imaginary inclined plane provided the area of those
portions above the inclined plane projected onto the vertical plane does not exceed ten
(10) percent of the area of the vertical plane lying between the thirty (30) foot cornice
line and the maximum height of the structure, calculated for and limited to each
separate plane.
However, the maximum height of any portion of a townhouse development shall be
forty (40) feet, except that in a Residence B district the maximum height shall be thirtyfive
(35) feet.
11.15.31 In any zoning district that limits building height to thirty-five (35) feet or less, the
maximum permitted height in a Townhouse Development shall be thirty-five (35) feet.
11.15.32 In all other districts the maximum permitted height in a townhouse development shall
be four habitable stores and the maximum height of the cornice line shall be thirty (30)
feet. Any part of a townhouse structure which projects above the cornice line shall be
set below an imaginary inclined plane beginning at the thirty (30) cornice line on any
façade of the structure facing a street or facing any lot line abutting a residentially
zoned lot, and thereafter rising at a forty-five (45) degree angle. However, portions of
the building may rise above the imaginary inclined plane provided the are of those
portions above the inclined plane projected into the vertical plane does not exceed ten
(10) percent of the area of the vertical plane lying between the thirty (30) foot cornice
line and the maximum height of the structure, calculated for and limited to each
separate plane.
11-5
However, the maximum height of any portion of a townhouse development shall be
forty (40) feet, except that in a Residence B district the maximum height shall be thirtyfive
(35) feet.
11.15.4 Yard Requirements. The yard requirements in the district shall be applicable for each
townhouse development.
11.15.5 Minimum Private Open Space. In a townhouse development the minimum ratio of
private open space as defined in Article 2.000 to lot area shall be twenty-five (25)
percent or that amount required in the district, whichever is greater.
(1) The minimum dimension of any area counted toward required private open space
shall be fifteen (15) feet. A ten (10) foot minimum open space dimension may be
allowed on special permit by the Special Permit Granting Authority upon its
determination that the peculiarities of the parcel warrant such a reduction, that the
smaller dimension will result in a superior site design, and that the total amount of
private open space will not be reduced.
(2) Where it is proposed to subdivide a townhouse development in accordance with
the requirements of Section 11.14 then the minimum ratio of private open space to
subdivided lot area shall be that required for the Townhouse Development as a
whole.
Where the townhouse development is not to be subdivided into individual lots and
therefore the private open space in a townhouse development is not to be provided
on subdivided lots but is to be provided on a common basis to be held in joint
ownership by a group of townhouse owners such as a cooperative or an
association, then the minimum ratio of private space to the total lot area in the
townhouse development shall be that required in this Section 11.15.5.
11.16 Parking Standards for Townhouse Development
A Townhouse Development shall be subject to the requirements of Article 6.000
except as they may be modified below.
11.16.1 One off street parking space per dwelling unit in a townhouse development shall be
provided unless a special permit is granted in accordance with Section 11.16.2(4)
below.
11.16.2 Required parking spaces may be located as follows:
(1) Within the townhouse structure or a separate structure on the parcel.
(2) On a lot in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6.20 and 6.40.
(3) On lots not more than two hundred (200) feet away from the building to be served
subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 6.20 and 6.40.
(4) On street in the vicinity of the townhouses if the special permit granting authority
determines that the lack of off street parking for the townhouse development will
not unreasonably reduce the quantity of on street parking in the area. Applicants
11-6
for an exception from off street parking shall submit a report on parking usage and
availability in the vicinity of the development with their permit application.
11.16.3 Landscaping of On Grade Open Parking
(1) On grade open parking areas should be arranged and landscaped to properly
screen cars from adjacent properties as well as from streets and sidewalks and to
diminish the negative environmental impacts of multiple automobiles parked on
site in residential neighborhoods.
(2) Twenty-five (25) percent of the area devoted to on grade open parking shall be
landscaped. The area devoted to on grade open parking shall be that portion of
the lot containing parking spaces, driveways, and landscaped area located
between or adjacent to parking spaces and drives. No portion of the lot required
as a setback between a parking space and a building or a lot line shall be counted
in computing the twenty-five (25) percent landscaping requirement.
(3) Where more than one area devoted to on grade open parking exists within a
townhouse development twenty-five (25) percent of each such area shall be
landscaped.
(4) For every two (2) on grade open parking spaces or fraction thereof there shall be a
minimum of one three (3) inch caliper tree located within the area devoted to on
grade open parking.
(a) The special permit granting authority may grant a special permit for a
reduction of this planting requirement upon its determination that such a
reduction will not prevent suitable screening of on grade parking and will
result in a superior site plan. Any reduction shall require a special permit.
(b) The trees required for the landscaping of on site parking areas - whether
such trees are coniferous or deciduous, flowering or nonflowering - should be
tolerant to urban environmental conditions; able to screen parking areas by
virtue of their size, form, density of foliage and spread; and easy to maintain.
A suggested list of trees which meet these criteria is:
Deciduous. Botanical name (common name)
Acer platanoides (Norway Maple); Acer rubrum (Red Maple); Acer
saccharum (Sugar Maple); Carpinus betulus (European Hornbeam); Fraxinus
americana (White Ash); Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo); Gledistsia triacanthos
inermis (Thornless Honey Locusts); Liquidambar styraciflua (Sweet Gum);
Liriodendron tulipfera (Tulip Tree); Platanus occidentlis (Syamore); Quercus
coccinea (Scarlet Oak); Quercus palustris (Pin Oak); Quercus rubra (Red
Oak); Tilia cordate greenspire (Littleleaf Linden); Tilia europea (Common
Linden).
(5) On grade open parking areas located in front of the townhouse structure(s) shall
maintain the visual definition of the front lot line and separation of public from
private space in keeping with the appearance and character of the existing
11-7
streetscape. Such definition shall be achieved by using a change of ground
materials at the front lot line and by installing at least one of the following: fences,
plantings, walls, or stone monuments which mark the transition from street or
sidewalk to residential lot.
11.17 Additional Requirements
(1) Fences may not exceed four (4) feet in height in any front yard unless otherwise
permitted by the special permit granting authority.
(2) Any townhouse unit directly abutting a street or streets shall have a principal
entrance on a facade facing a street unless otherwise permitted by the special
permit granting authority.
11.30 FAST ORDER FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS
11.31 In considering applications for Special Permits for Fast Order Food Establishments
and Automobile Oriented Fast Order Food Service Establishments, the Board of
Zoning Appeal shall find, in addition to the other criteria specified in Section 10.40, that
the following requirements are met:
(a) the operation of the establishment shall not:
(1) create traffic problems,
(2) reduce available parking,
(3) threaten the public safety in the streets and sidewalks, or
(4) encourage or produce double parking on the adjacent public street(s),
(b) the physical design, including color and use of materials, of the establishment shall
be compatible with and sensitive to the visual and physical characteristics of other
buildings, public spaces and uses in the particular location;
(c) the establishment fulfills a need for such a service in the neighborhood or in the
city;
(d) the establishment will attract patrons primarily from walk in trade as opposed to
drive in or automobile related trade; however, should the Board specifically find
that the district or area within which the establishment is proposed to be located
does not have significant pedestrian traffic, this requirement need not be met.
(e) the establishment shall, to the greatest extent feasible, utilize biodegradable
materials in packaging the food and in the utensils and other items provided for
consumption thereof;
(f) the establishment shall provide convenient, suitable and well marked waste
receptacles to encourage patrons properly to dispose of all packaging materials,
utensils and other items provided with the sale of food; and
(g) the establishment complies with all state and local requirements applicable to
ingress, egress, and use of all facilities on the premises for handicapped and
disabled persons.
11-8
11.32 Establishments seeking to relocate their operations inside the boundary line of the
zoning district in which the establishment is located shall not be required to obtain a
special permit if both of the following conditions will be met.
11.32.1 The new site shall be within five hundred (500) feet of the original site of the
establishment.
11.32.2 There will be no increase in the gross floor area of the establishment at the new site.
11.33 A Special Permit issued for a Fast Order Food Establishment hereunder may be
utilized only by the owner or operator of such establishment as described in the
application documents or as those documents may be modified by the conditions of
the Special Permit as granted.
In granting a Special Permit under this Section 11.30 the Board shall specifically detail
in its decision the kind of Fast Order Food for which the Permit is granted and shall
also identify those other aspects of the establishment as outlined in the application
documents for which alterations will require the issuance of a new Special Permit.
11.40 DELETED (See Article 22.70)
11.50 DELETED (See Article 20.000)
11.60 DELETED (See Article 20.000)
11.70 DELETED (See Article 20.000)
11.80 EMPLOYMENT COMPLIANCE PROCEDURE
11.81 Purpose. As specified in Section 1.30, one of the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance is
encouragement of the most appropriate use of land throughout the City, including
appropriate economic development. Through amendments to this Ordinance and by
related actions the City has established a program for promoting new economic
development activity in underutilized, industrially zoned districts. As part of its
economic development program, the City seeks to promote development which will
provide expanded job opportunities for unemployed and underemployed citizens of
Cambridge. It is the purpose of this Section 11.80 to ensure that, prior to initiating
construction of new employment generating land uses, development entities
demonstrate that they have considered and responded to the Cambridge Citizens
Employment Plan.
11.82 Applicability. The provisions of this Section 11.80 shall apply to new economic
development activity in the Alewife Revitalization District and the South Cambridgeport
Revitalization Area and in other major economic revitalization areas designated by City
Council through amendments to this Subsection 11.82. The Alewife Revitalization
District shall be that area contained within the comprehensive Alewife Area rezoning
amendment ordained on June 16, 1980. The South Cambridgeport Revitalization Area
shall be that area contained within the comprehensive South Cambridgeport Rezoning
11-9
Amendment as ordained by City Council on February 10, 1992. For purposes of this
Section 11.80, the following shall be considered new economic activity:
11.82.1 Construction of any new building which will be a principal use under Subsections 4.31i-2
(hotel/motel), 4.34 (office and laboratory), 4.35 (retail business and consumer service),
4.36 (drive-in retail and service), 4.37 (light industry, wholesale business and storage) and
4.38 (heavy industry) of the table of use regulations.
11.82.2 Expansion or alteration of an existing building occupied by a principal use included in
one of the use categories listed in Subsection 11.82.1, provided that such expansion or
alteration will increase the gross floor area of the building by five thousand (5000)
square feet or more.
11.83 Employment Opportunity Certification. When applying for a building permit for
applicable development as specified in Subsection 11.82, the applicant for such permit
shall file with the Superintendent of Buildings a certification from the City Manager, or
his designee, that the applicant has prepared and filed with the City a statement
indicating how the proposed development will comply with the most recently adopted
Cambridge Citizens Employment Plan.
11.200 INCENTIVE ZONING AND INCLUSIONARY HOUSING
11.201 Purposes.
The purposes of Sections 11.200 to 11.206 are to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare by accommodating the expansion of commercial and residential opportunities
throughout the city; by providing for a full range of housing choices throughout the City for
households of all incomes, ages, and sizes in order to meet the Citys goal of preserving
diversity by mitigating the impacts of commercial and residential development on the
availability and cost of housing and especially housing affordable to low and moderate
income households; by increasing the production of affordable housing to meet
anticipated housing and employment needs throughout the city; by providing a
mechanism through which commercial and residential development can contribute in a
direct way to increasing the supply of affordable housing in exchange for a greater density
or intensity of development than that otherwise permitted as a matter of right; and by
establishing standards for the use of such contributions from the application of incentive
zoning and inclusionary housing provisions.
11.202 Incentive Zoning. The developer or owner of an Incentive Project shall make a Housing
Contribution in accordance with this Section 11.202.
(a) Calculation of Housing Contribution. The Housing Contribution shall be calculated by
multiplying the Gross Floor Area devoted to the uses that qualify the new development as
an Incentive Project by the Housing Contribution Rate effective at the time the
Superintendent of Buildings issues the first building permit for the Incentive Project. If a
building permit is not required, the Housing Contribution Rate shall be the rate effective at
the time the Housing Contribution is provided.
11-10
(b) Housing Contribution Rate. The Housing Contribution Rate effective on September 28,
2015 shall be twelve dollars ($12.00) per square foot of Gross Floor Area devoted to the
uses that qualify the new development as an Incentive Project. The effective rate shall be
subject to annual escalation equal to annual percentage increases in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) Housing Index for Boston-Brockton-Nashua, MA-NH-ME-CT or similar index
to reflect changes in dollar values over time; however, annual decreases in CPI shall not
cause the contribution rate to be decreased. In addition, on September 28 each year from
2016 to 2018 inclusive, the Housing Contribution Rate shall increase by one dollar
($1.00). The table below sets forth the Housing Contribution Rate over time.
Effective Date Housing Contribution Rate
September 28, 2015 $12.00 per square foot.
September 28, 2016 (Annual
Adjustment)
$13.00 per square foot.
November 16, 2016 (CPI
Adjustment)
$13.50 per square foot.
(c) Timing of Payment. The developer or owner of an Incentive Project shall provide the
Housing Contribution to the Managing Trustee of the Affordable Housing Trust or its
designee, who shall certify to the Superintendent of Buildings that the requirements of this
Section are met prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the Incentive Project. If
the Gross Floor Area of an Incentive Project is subsequently increased accommodating
uses that qualify as Incentive Project uses, then notwithstanding the size of the increase,
a Housing Contribution calculated in the manner set forth in this Section shall be provided
for every square foot of that increase.
(d) Reevaluation of Housing Contribution Rate. The City shall initiate a reevaluation of the
Housing Contribution Rate and any other aspect of these Incentive Zoning Provisions at
an interval of no less than three (3) years from the time the rate was last amended by the
City Council. Such reevaluation shall include a report provided to the City Council
reviewing economic factors including but not limited to development activity, commercial
rents per square foot, employment growth, housing trends measured in terms of, but not
limited to, vacancy rates, production statistics, and prices for dwelling units, and the nexus
between Incentive Projects and housing.
11.203 Inclusionary Housing.
11.203.1 Applicability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided, this Section 11.203 shall apply in all zoning districts
throughout the city.
(b) The requirements of this Section 11.203 shall apply to any Inclusionary Housing
Project issued a special permit or, if no special permit has been issued, a building
permit on or after December 1, 2016, (the date of the first advertisement of the most
recent amendment to this Section 11.203)
11-11
(c) For any Inclusionary Housing Project that has been issued a Special Permit for a
Planned Unit Development by the Planning Board prior to December 1, 2016, (the
date of the first advertisement of the most recent amendment to this Section 11.203),
an amendment to that Special Permit that relates to modification of the street layout
or other aspects of the Final Development Plan directly resulting from a delay,
cancellation, or change in a state controlled infrastructure project shall be subject to
the Inclusionary Housing provisions in effect at the time of the issuance of the original
Special Permit or any amendment thereto issued prior to December 1, 2016, (the
date of the first advertisement of the most recent amendment to this Section
11.203.) In no case shall this provision allow an increase of gross floor area, an
increase in the number of units above what is allowed by the Special Permit, or an
increase of the maximum height allowed by zoning for the Project.
11.203.2 Inclusionary Housing Requirement.
(a) For Inclusionary Housing Projects issued a special permit or, if no special permit has
been issued, a building permit on or after December 1, 2016 (the date of the first
advertisement of the most recent amendment to this Section 11.203) but on or before
June 30, 2017, fifteen percent (15%) of the total Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area within
the project shall be devoted to Affordable Dwelling Units.
(b) For Inclusionary Housing Projects issued a special permit or, if no special permit has
been issued, a building permit after June 30, 2017, twenty percent (20%) of the total
Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area within the project shall be devoted to Affordable Dwelling
Units.
(c) The City shall initiate a reevaluation of the Inclusionary Housing Requirement at an
interval of no more than five (5) years from the time the Inclusionary Housing
Requirement was last amended. Such reevaluation shall include a report provided to
the City Council reviewing factors such as changes in demographic characteristics
and residential development activity, housing trends measured in terms of, but not
limited to, vacancy rates, production statistics, prices for dwelling units, and
affordability, and the relationship between Inclusionary Housing Projects and all
housing in Cambridge. The Community Development Department shall also conduct
an annual review and report on the Inclusionary Housing Program.
11.203.3 Standards for Providing Affordable Dwelling Units Created through Inclusionary Housing.
(a) Affordable Dwelling Units shall be provided on-site.
(b) Affordable Dwelling Units shall be similar in size, layout, construction materials,
fixtures, amenities, and interior and exterior finishes to comparable non-Affordable
Dwelling Units in the project.
(c) Affordable Dwelling Units shall have similar access to common areas, facilities, and
services as that enjoyed by comparable non-Affordable Dwelling Units in the project
including but not limited to outdoor spaces, amenity spaces, storage, parking, bicycle
parking facilities, and resident services.
11-12
(d) Affordable Dwelling Units shall be dispersed throughout the project rather than
concentrated on particular floors, within sections of a building, or within particular
buildings in a project with multiple buildings.
(e) Except as specified below for Family-Sized Dwelling Units, the proportionate amounts
of Affordable Dwelling Units defined by size and number of bedrooms within the total
amount of Affordable Dwelling Units shall be similar to the proportionate amounts of
non-Affordable Dwelling Units defined by size and number of bedrooms within the
total amount of non-Affordable Dwelling Units in the project.
(f) The ratio of Family-Sized Affordable Dwelling Units to all Affordable Dwelling Units
shall be greater than or equal to the ratio of non-Affordable Family-Sized Dwelling
Units to all non-Affordable Dwelling Units in the project, notwithstanding that in some
cases this may result in a smaller proportion of Affordable Dwelling Units that are not
Family-Sized Dwelling Units in the project and a smaller proportion of total Affordable
Dwelling Units in the project in order to meet the required percentage of Dwelling Unit
Net Floor Area devoted to Affordable Dwelling Units in the project.
(g) Townhouse or multifamily residential projects of at least thirty thousand (30,000)
square feet of Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area shall provide Family-Sized Affordable
Dwelling Units at a ratio of at least one dwelling unit per every six thousand (6,000)
square feet of required Affordable Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area in the project,
rounded to the nearest whole unit with fractions of 0.5 unit or more rounded up and
fractions of less than 0.5 unit rounded down, or the ratio derived from paragraph (f)
above, whichever is greater.
(h) The ratio of rental to owner-occupied Affordable Dwelling Units shall mirror the ratio of
rental to owner-occupied non-Affordable Dwelling Units in the project except that no
Affordable Dwelling Units shall be rental Affordable Dwelling Units where a majority of
all dwelling units in the project are initially offered for sale.
(i) In cases where the owner and the Community Development Department agree that
the above standards, as applied, result in a total Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area of all
Affordable Dwelling Units that is less than the Affordable Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area
required to be provided pursuant to the Inclusionary Housing Requirement, the
remainder of the Inclusionary Housing Requirement shall be met through a monetary
contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust equal to the amount of subsidy
necessary to create an equivalent amount of Affordable Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area
in a project assisted by the Affordable Housing Trust. The Affordable Housing Trust
shall periodically provide to the Community Development Department a report on
projects it has assisted from which the Community Development Department shall
calculate the amount of subsidy necessary to create a square foot of Dwelling Unit
Net Floor Area in an affordable housing project assisted by the Affordable Housing
Trust. Such calculation may be adjusted by the Community Development Department
from time to time. Prior to issuance of a building permit for the project, the Community
Development Department shall multiply the calculated per-square-foot amount by the
outstanding Affordable Dwelling Unit Net Floor Area necessary to satisfy the
Inclusionary Housing Requirement to determine the necessary monetary contribution,
11-13
which shall be made prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the
project.
11.203.4 Standards for Eligibility, Rent, Initial Sale Price, and Parking Fees for Affordable Dwelling

percent (80%) of AMI. A gross household income less than fifty percent
(50%) of AMI may be permitted in the case of an Eligible Household having
a rental subsidy allowing it to pay a rent equivalent to that paid by an Eligible
Household with a gross household income within the range set forth above.
(ii) Rent, including utilities and any other fees routinely charged to tenants and
approved by the Community Development Department, shall not exceed
thirty percent (30%) of the gross household income of the Eligible
Household occupying the Affordable Dwelling Unit, except that in the case
of Affordable Studio Dwelling Units, rent shall not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the gross household income of the Eligible Household
occupying the Affordable Dwelling Unit.
(iii) After initial occupancy, the gross household income of an Eligible
Household shall be verified annually to determine continued eligibility and
rent, in accordance with policies, standards, and procedures established by
the Community Development Department.
(iv) An Eligible Household may continue to rent an Affordable Dwelling Unit
after initial occupancy even if the Eligible Households gross household
income exceeds eighty percent (80%) of AMI, but if the Eligible Households
gross household income exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of AMI, or a
percentage promulgated in a regulation by the Community Development
Department from time to time, for more than one year after that Eligible
Households gross household income has been verified to exceed such
percentage, the dwelling unit shall no longer qualify as an Affordable
Dwelling Unit and either the dwelling unit must be rented to a new Eligible
Household or a comparable non-Affordable Dwelling Unit in the project
must become an Affordable Dwelling Unit.
11-14
(v) An Eligible Household may continue to rent an Affordable Dwelling Unit
after initial occupancy even if the Eligible Households gross household
income falls below fifty percent (50%) of AMI, but the Eligible Household
shall pay a rent that is no less than thirty percent (30%) of forty percent
(40%) of AMI or, in the case of an Affordable Studio Dwelling Unit, the
Eligible Household shall pay a rent that is no less than twenty-five percent
(25%) of forty percent (40%) of AMI.
(vi) Where an optional parking fee exists, it shall not exceed the lesser of the
following amounts for Affordable Dwelling Units:
(vii) an amount calculated by applying to the rent of the Affordable Dwelling Unit
the ratio of optional parking fee to rent for comparable non-Affordable
Dwelling Units with the lowest non-affordable rent in the project, or
(viii) an amount which, when added to the rent for an Affordable Dwelling Unit,
shall not exceed thirty-three percent (33%) of the renting Eligible
Households gross household income or, in the case of an Affordable
Studio Dwelling Unit, twenty-eight percent (28%) of the renting Eligible
Households gross household income.
(ix) Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in (i) through (vi) above, an
owner may voluntarily choose to charge a lower rent than as provided
herein for Affordable Dwelling Units or to rent Affordable Dwelling Units to

ensure that the monthly housing payment (which shall include debt service at
prevailing mortgage loan interest rates, utilities, condominium or related fees,
insurance, real estate taxes, and parking fees, if any) shall not exceed thirty
percent (30%) of ninety percent (90%) of monthly AMI, except that in the
case of an Affordable Studio Dwelling Unit, the monthly housing payment
shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of ninety percent (90%) of monthly
AMI.

11.500 PLANNING OVERLAY REQUIREMENTS
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide temporarily for review of large scale
development in order to ensure conformance with the Cambridge Growth Policy
Document, Towards a Sustainable Future: and guarantee that the city infrastructure
can support potential increases in traffic.
11-17
11.501 Term of Effect. The provisions of this Section 11.500 apply to any building permit
granted between Wednesday, July 1, 1998 and Monday, February 12, 2001, inclusive.
11.502 Applicability. The provisions of this Section 11.500 apply to all new construction of
50,000 square feet or more of gross floor area or new construction of a parking facility
which will cause such facility to have a net increase of more than 150 in the number of
nonresidential parking spaces, involving a change of category of use, such categories
being defined as those numbered and bolded in Section 4.30 of this Ordinance. The
provisions of this section also apply to any project that will bring the total construction
on the lot, or an abutting lot or lots that are or have been in common ownership at any
time since May 1, 1998, to 50,000 square feet of more gross floor area during the
effective period of this section. This section shall not apply to any housing projects
with a substantial component of affordable units (defined as more than 25% of units

11.503 The Planning Overlay Special Permit
11.510 A Planning Overlay Special Permit shall be required from the Planning Board for all
projects subject to this Section 11.502. The Planning Board may request reports from the
Community Development Department, Conservation Commission, Historical Commission
or other pertinent boards and commissions regarding compliance with Growth Policies 13,
27, 39, and 66 as set forth in Section 11.512. Before a building permit for a project to
which paragraph 11.502 applies can be issued, the project must receive a Planning
Overlay Special Permit. The application for the Planning Overlay Special Permit may be
simultaneous with the application to the Planning Board for other special permits. No
application for this permit will be accepted unless it is accompanied, at a minimum, by the
following documents:
(a) The information required by the Large Project Submittal Requirements as described
in Paragraph 1.45 of this Ordinance.
(b) A traffic study certified as being done in a complete and reliable manner by the
Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department. The required traffic study shall
include information on Parking Transportation Demand Management measures,
which may mitigate projected traffic impacts. Such certifications must be issued or
denied within twenty-one (21) days of its request and must only certified the
methodology used, not necessarily the accuracy of the data.
Any applicant who has been granted a special permit prior to the effective date of this
amendment must apply for a Planning Overlay Special Permit by no later than 60 (sixty)
days after the issuance of the original special permit.
11.511 Criteria for Special Permit
11-18
A. In granting a planning overlay special permit the Planning Board will ensure that the
project conforms with the following growth policies as set forth in the Cambridge
Growth Policy Document, Towards a Sustainable Future:
Growth Policy #13. A pace of development or redevelopment should be
encouraged that permits the maintenance of a healthy tax base, allows for
adjustment and adaptation to changing economic conditions, and is consistent
with the Citys urban design and other physical development objectives yet does
not unreasonably disrupt the daily activities of the citys neighborhoods and
residents or overburden the citys water and sewer infrastructure.
Growth Policy #27. Where possible, construct new affordable housing that fits
neighborhood character. In existing residential neighborhoods housing should be
built at scale, density, and character consistent with existing development
patterns. Permit reconstruction of affordable housing (defined as more than 50%
of units rented or owned by households at 80% or less than median income) that
serves a wide range of incomes and groups at previous nonconforming density
where reconstruction is less expensive than rehabilitation. Emphasize
construction of affordable housing designed for families with children.
Growth Policy #39. Development patterns in all nonresidential areas must be
planned to minimize negative impact on abutting residential neighborhoods.
Growth Policy #66. New open space facilities, including larger ones for organized
activities, should be considered for those private developments where the size of
the development, the amount of and area and/or the ownership patterns provide
the flexibility to accommodate such a facility without loss of economic value for
other uses.
B. Additionally, the Planning Board shall, before issuing a special permit, find that the
project will have no substantial adverse impact on city traffic. In determining whether
there is a substantial adverse impact, the Planning Board shall apply criteria for
measuring traffic impact based on the best available measures of traffic volumes and
level of service, as recommended by the Traffic, Transportation and Parking
Department. These criteria shall be updated as new data on existing traffic volumes
and level of service are compiled.
11.512 Enforcement. The Superintendent of Buildings will require certification from the Planning
Board that it has issued a special permit to the applicant to which paragraph 11.502
applies before issuing a building permit to that applicant.
11.513 Expiration. A Planning Overlay Special Permit will expire one (1) year if construction on
the project has not begun and no extension has been granted by the Planning Board.
Such extension may only be granted for good cause. If expiration takes place the
Superintendent of Buildings will revoke any building permit granted under the special
permit effective the date of expiration.

12.20 AREA OF APPLICABILITY
12.30 REVIEW OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS
12.40 ENFORCEMENT
12.50 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
12.10 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
This Article of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge is hereby adopted to
encourage the construction of Planned Unit Developments. The Planned Unit
Development districts and uses created herein are intended to provide greater
opportunity for the construction of quality developments on large tracts of land by
providing flexible guidelines which allow the integration a variety of land uses and
densities in one development.
12.20 AREA OF APPLICABILITY
A Planned Unit Development shall be allowed by Special Permit in PUD districts so
designated from time to time on the zoning map and shall be regulated by the general
development controls set forth in Section 12.50 and by the specific development
controls for the individual PUD district in which the project is located. Planned Unit
Development Districts shall be overlay districts on the zoning map and, for any land
within a PUD district, a developer may choose to conform either to all the controls
which govern the base district or to all the PUD development controls and process.
12.30 REVIEW OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS
12.31 Review Scope. An application to construct a Planned Unit Development must be
reviewed in a manner which is consistent with the procedures set forth in this Section
12.30 and those procedures required by Chapter 40A of the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as amended.
12.32 Constitution of Review Authority. The Planning Board shall review and approve or
disapprove all applications for Special Permits to construct Planned Unit
Developments. In reviewing an application for a Special Permit for a Planned Unit
Development, the Planning Board may also seek the professional opinion of the staff
of city departments, including but not limited to, the Community Development
Department, Public Works Department, Traffic and Parking Department, Police
Department, Fire Department, Water Department, and School Department.
12.33 Pre-application Conference. A developer desiring to obtain a Special Permit to
construct a Planned Unit Development may request a Pre-Application Conference
with the Planning Board prior to submitting an application for the Special Permit.
12-2
12.33.1 The purpose of the Pre-Application Conference shall be to familiarize both the
developer and the Planning Board with each other's intentions with respect to the
PUD. Although a Pre-Application Conference shall not be required, this preliminary

Board that the Final Development Plan meets the evaluation criteria set forth in
Section 12.35.3 and contains any revisions to the Development Proposal required by
the Planning Board. If the Planning Board grants the Special Permit with conditions,
the conditions must be agreed to in writing by the developer before the Special Permit
is granted. The Planning Board shall make its final decision in writing and shall
specify its reason for not granting a Special Permit to construct a PUD. If the Planning
Board makes no decision within the specified time limit, then the Final Development
12-6
Plan shall be considered approved and the Special Permit to construct a PUD shall be
deemed granted.
12.37 Amendments to Final Development Plan. After approval of the Final Development
Plan by the Planning Board, the developer may seek amendments to the Final
Development Plan, only if he encounters difficulties in constructing the PUD which
could not have reasonably been foreseen, such as with terrain or soil conditions or
other complications.
12.37.1 Amendments to the Final Development Plan shall be considered major or minor.
Minor amendments, as specified in Section 12.37.2 shall be authorized by written
approval of the Planning Board. Major amendments, as specified in Section 12.37.3,
shall be considered as an original application for a Special Permit to construct a PUD
and shall be subject to procedures specified in Section 12.34 through 12.36. The
Planning Board shall decide whether proposed changes are major or minor.
12.37.2 Minor amendments are changes which do not alter the concept of the PUD in terms of
density, floor area ratio, land usage, height, provision of open space, or the physical
relationship of elements of the development. Minor amendments shall include, but not
be limited to, small changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or
realignment of minor streets.
12.37.3 Major amendments represent substantial deviations from the PUD concept approved
by the Planning Board. Major amendments shall include, but not be limited to, large
changes in floor space, mix of uses, density, lot coverage, height, setbacks, lot sizes,
open space; changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or changes
in the circulation system.
12.40 ENFORCEMENT
12.41 Commencement of Construction. The developer shall begin construction of the PUD
within twelve (12) months of the date of the granting of the Special Permit to construct
a PUD. The Planning Board may grant in writing an extension of this time period of up
to twelve (12) months upon determination of good cause by the developer. If the
developer fails to commence construction of the PUD within the specified time, the
Special Permit shall lapse.
12.41.1 If the PUD is to be developed in stages, then the developer must begin the
construction of each stage within the time limits specified in the Final Development
Plan. Construction in each phase shall include all the elements of that phase
specified in the Final Development Plan.
12.42 The Planning Board, or its Designee, shall periodically monitor the construction of the
PUD, with respect to start of construction and development phasing. If the Planning
Board, or its designee, finds that either the developer has failed to begin development
within the specified time period or that the developer is not preceding in accordance
with the approved development phasing, with respect to either timing or construction
of an approved mix of project elements, then the Planning Board shall review the PUD
12-7
and may extend the time for start of construction or the length of time needed to
complete a phase, revoke the Special Permit, or recommend that the developer
amend the Final Development Plan subject to procedures specified in Section 12.37.
If the Planning Board revokes the Special Permit for the PUD then the Final
Development Plan shall be null and void.
12.50 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
12.51 Applicability and Conformance with Existing Policy Plans. The following regulations in
this Section 12.50 shall control development within each PUD district. Each
development proposal for a PUD shall, to the extent feasible, be made to conform to
existing policy plans established by the Planning Board or City Council from time to
time for the specific area of the city in which the PUD is located.
12.52 PUD Development Parcel Size. The minimum size of a development parcel for a
planned unit development shall be as indicated in each planned unit developments
individual regulations; however the Planning Board may, at its discretion, allow
development parcels containing less than the minimum parcel size required but at
least five times the minimum required area for a lot in the base zoning district in which
the development would be located. The Planning Board shall permit a development
parcel containing less than the minimum parcel size required only upon its written
determination that public review and approval of such a small development is
necessary for accomplishing the planning objectives of the PUD district in which the
development is located.
12.53 Standards for Construction of Roadways. All new roadways within a PUD shall be
constructed in conformance with standards established by the Department of Traffic
and Parking.
12.53.1 Any existing private way or subsequently constructed private way in a PUD may be
accepted by the City as a public way only if it meets the Minimum Standards for
Acceptance of Existing Private Ways as Public Ways as adopted by the Planning
Board.
12.53.2 The design of the overall circulation pattern shall be prepared in accordance with the
principles and concepts established in Recommended Practices for Subdivision
Streets prepared by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (1965).

district of high quality general and technical office and retail activity, with a significant
component of residential use. The creation of a large public park is desired. The
PUD-KS district permits larger scale development and supporting commercial
activities close to Kendall Square and the major public transit services located there. It
encourages strong linkages between new development at Kendall Square, the East
Cambridge riverfront, and the PUD-KS area and the neighborhoods of eastern
Cambridge, facilitated in part by a strong retail presence along Third Street.
Development in the PUD-KS district should be generally consistent with the policy
objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and the guidance provided in the
Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.
13.12 Uses Allowed in a PUD-KS District. The uses listed in this Section 13.12, alone or in
combination with each other, shall be allowed upon permission of the Planning Board.
The amount and extent of uses may be further regulated and limited as set forth
elsewhere in this Section 13.10.
13.12.1 Residential Uses

13.12.2 Transportation, Communication, Utility and Institutional Uses. All uses listed in
sections 4.32 and 4.33 and which are allowed or conditionally allowed in the base
zoning district. Telephone exchange use set forth in 4.32 g (1) shall be permitted
provided that any facility having a floor area greater than four hundred (400) square
feet shall only be permitted in a building in existence as of June 1, 2001 that, if
vacant, has not been occupied by a residential use in the five years immediately
preceding the time of application for a Certificate Of Occupancy for the proposed use,
or if occupied, the current use is any office and laboratory use, Section 4.34; any retail
business and consumer service establishment, Section 4.35; any light industry,
wholesale business or storage use, Section 4.37; or any heavy industry use, Section
4.38.
13.12.3 Office and Laboratory Uses. All uses listed in Section 4.34.
13.12.4 Retail Business and Consumer Service Establishments. The following retail uses
shall be permitted, provided that the total amount of retail GFA in the District does not
exceed 70,000 square feet and no individual establishment exceeds ten thousand
(10,000) square feet of Gross Floor Area unless the Planning Board determines in
writing that more retail GFA and establishments of a greater size better serve the
residents within the PUD district and in adjacent districts and better advance the
policies set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines.
(1) Stationery and office supply store.

allowed in a Business B District may be allowed by the Planning Board only upon
written determination by the Board that such use is consistent with the objectives of
the PUD-KS district and the policies and guidelines set forth in the ECaPS Plan.
13.13 District Dimensional Regulations.
13.13.1 Permitted FAR. In the PUD-KS District the maximum ratio of floor area to
Development Parcel shall be 3.0, subject to the further use limitations set forth below
in Section 13.13.11.
13-3
13.13.11 Limitations on Non-Residential Development. In the PUD-KS District all nonresidential
uses shall be further limited as set forth below. Where the amount of nonresidential
Gross Floor Area (GFA) is limited to a percentage of the total GFA
authorized, the calculation shall be based on GFA authorized exclusive of any GFA
that may be constructed as a result of the application of the FAR bonuses permitted in
Section 11.200 or any GFA devoted exclusively to structured parking.
(1) For any lot or combination of lots held in common ownership as of June 1, 2001
having in total an area of less than five acres, the total GFA devoted to non-residential
uses shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the total GFA authorized in a PUD for that
portion of a PUD Development Parcel containing such lot or lots, or any portion
thereof. This limitation shall apply to each Development Parcel individually. This
limitation shall not apply to any individual lot created subsequent to the Planning
Board approval of the PUD Final Development Plan.
Notwithstanding the above limitations, additional non-residential GFA shall be
permitted as set forth in Paragraph (3) below.
(2) For any lot or combination of lots held in common ownership as of June 1, 2001
having in total an area of more than five (5) acres, the total GFA devoted to nonresidential
uses shall not exceed sixty (60) percent of total GFA authorized, inclusive
of any GFA otherwise exempt from the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance
in a PUD for that portion of a PUD Development Parcel containing such lot or lots, or
any portion thereof. This limitation shall not apply to any individual lot created
subsequent to the Planning Board approval of the PUD Final Development Plan.
Notwithstanding the above limitations, additional non-residential GFA shall be
permitted as set forth in Paragraph (3) below.
At least ninety-five (95) percent of the authorized non-residential GFA must be located
on the portion of said lot or lots having an Office 2 base district designation.
However, where circumstances related to the transfer of property from the federal
government to other governmental or private entities (for the purpose of private
development on a portion or all of the land in the control of the federal government)
the Planning Board may in its discretion approve a Final Development Plan providing
GFA in excess of sixty (60) percent of the authorized GFA in the PUD provided it is
conclusively demonstrated to the Planning Board that all residential GFA required to
be developed on such lot or lots in their entirety, by this Paragraph, has already been
constructed.
(3) For the entire PUD-KS district, the first 50,000 square feet of retail and customer
service uses authorized in total in all approved PUDs shall not be counted toward the
non-residential GFA limitations of Paragraphs (1) and (2) above provided the GFA is
located on the ground floor of a multistory building, fronts on and has a public
entrance onto Third Street, Broadway, or a public park, and for each individual
establishment the GFA does not exceed 10,000 square feet.
13.13.2 Minimum Development Parcel Size. The minimum size of a Development Parcel
within the PUD-KS shall be the greater of (1) 40,000 square feet or (2) seventy-five
percent of the area of a lot or combination of lots (a) in existence as of June 1, 2001
and (b) held in common ownership where it is proposed to incorporate any portion of
such lot or lots within the Development Parcel. A Development Parcel within the
PUD-KS may contain noncontiguous lots elsewhere in the PUD-KS district or within a
contiguous PUD district. There shall be no specified minimum lot size for lots located
within a Development Parcel.
13-4
However, where circumstances related to the transfer of property from the federal
government to other governmental or private entities (for the purpose of private
development on a portion or all of the land in the control of the federal government)
limit the feasibility of creating a Development Parcel meeting the size requirements of
this Section 13.13.2, the Planning Board may in its discretion approve a PUD
application having a smaller Development Parcel size.
13.13.3 Residential Density. For the purpose of computing residential density, the minimum lot
size for each dwelling unit shall be three hundred (300) square feet. Residential
density shall be computed based on the entire development parcel.
13.13.4 Maximum Building Height.
13.13.41 The maximum height permitted in the district shall be sixty-five (65) feet except as it
may be further limited or permitted below. The permitted heights are further illustrated
on the Building Height Regulation Map for the PUD-KS, Map 13.11.
(1) Additional Building Height to Eighty-Five Feet. The maximum height shall be
eighty-five (85) feet in the areas described below:
(a) An area bounded by the centerlines of Fifth Street, Monroe Street, Third
Street and Potter Street.
(b) An area bounded by the centerline of Potter Street and its northwesterly
extension; then the centerline of the former Sixth Street (the MXD district
boundary line); then a line northeasterly of, parallel to and two hundred (200) feet
distant from the northeasterly sideline of Broadway; then a line northwesterly of,
parallel to, and three hundred (300) feet distant from the northwesterly sideline of
Third Street, to the point of beginning.
(2) Additional Building Height to One Hundred and Twenty Feet. The maximum height
shall be one hundred and twenty (120) feet in that area bounded by areas described in
Paragraph (1) above; then the centerline of Third Street; then a line northeasterly of,
parallel to, and one hundred (100) distant from the northeasterly sideline of Broadway;
then the centerline of the former Sixth Street (the MXD district boundary line) to the
point of beginning.
(3) Additional Building Height to One Hundred and Eighty Feet with Portions to Two
Hundred and Fifty Feet. The maximum height shall be one hundred and eighty (180)
feet in that area bounded by the area described in Paragraph (2) above; then the
centerline of Third Street; then the centerline of Broadway; and then the centerline of
the former Sixth Street (the MXD district boundary line) to the point of beginning.
However, portions of buildings may rise above one hundred and eighty (180) feet to no
more than two hundred and fifty (250) feet provided the area of all floorplates of
portions of buildings above 180 feet do not exceed ten percent of the total area of the
Development Parcel.
(4) Portions of Buildings limited to Forty-five Feet. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Paragraphs (1)  (3) above, any portion of a building that is within fifty (50) feet of an
existing or proposed Public Open Space or single intervening street abutting that open
space may exceed 45 feet only if for each floor above 45 feet, that floor is set back an
additional 10 feet from the façade of the floor below, until the maximum height is
attained, or until a 20 foot setback from the façade at 45 feet is attained. Alternately, a
set back of 20 feet from the façade of the building at a height of 45 feet shall be
permitted, and the remaining portions of the building allowed to achieve the maximum
13-5
height permitted in Paragraphs (1)  (3) above or any variation between the two
provisions.
13.13.42 The Planning Board shall not approve any Final Development Plan in the PUD-KS
District not in conformance with the regulations of Section 13.13.4 above. In the
portion of the PUD-KS that allows buildings to 200 feet or more, the Planning Board
may approve a building up to 250 feet if other buildings or portions of buildings in that
portion of the Development Parcel are no higher than one hundred and fifty (150) feet.
13.13.43 In evaluating a development proposal providing building height in excess of one
hundred and twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give consideration to evidence
presented on the following:
(a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will
unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the vicinity to
a significantly greater extent than if the building height did not exceed one hundred
and twenty (120) feet;
(b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as
excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous
development;
(c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased
sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristics of the particular location through
more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to the proposed and existing
buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the proposed
building;
(a) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of
traffic and parking on the surrounding area; and
(b) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure would not otherwise
diminish the health and safety of the area around the development parcel.
(c) The additional height permits accommodation of GFA transferred from the
Eastern Cambridge Development Rights Transfer Donating District.
13.13.5 Other Dimensional Requirements. There shall be no minimum width for the
development parcel and no minimum width for lots located within the development
parcel. There shall be no minimum required front, rear and side yard requirements for
a development parcel or for lots located within a development parcel. The Planning
Board shall approve all such lot sizes and building setbacks.
13.14 Open Space. The following Open Space requirements shall be met on each
Development Parcel.
(1) For that portion of a Development Parcel consisting of lots described in
Section 13.13.11, Paragraph (1) above, any combination of Public Open Space,
Green Area Open Space or Permeable Open Space, as defined in this
Ordinance, shall be provided on the Development Parcel and shall in the
aggregate equal at least twenty (20) percent of the area of that portion of the
Development Parcel.
(2) For that portion of a Development Parcel consisting of lots described in
Section 13.13.11, Paragraph (2) above, any combination of Public Open Space,
Green Area Open Space or Permeable Open Space, as defined in this
Ordinance, shall be provided on the Development Parcel and shall in the
13-6
aggregate equal at least Forty-two (42) percent of the area of that portion of the
Development Parcel, subject to the further limitations set forth in Section 13.14.1
below.
Owners of adjacent Development Parcels may collectively provide the required open
space by easement, deed restriction, covenant, or comparable legal instrument
enforceable by the City of Cambridge or other public entity. In that event each
Development Parcel shall, for purposes of this Section 13.10 be deemed to include
that portion of such open space as the owners shall allocate to it in chosen legal
instrument.
All required open space shall be generally accessible to the public for reasonable
periods throughout the day for the purposes for which the open space is designed and
approved by the Planning Board, which may include but not be limited to walking,
bicycling, active and passive recreation. The Planning Board must approve any
proposal to significantly limit public access to the required open space.
13.14.1 Required Public Open Space. For that open space required in Section 13.14,
Paragraph (2) above, the required open space shall consist in part of a contiguous 7.5
acre Public Open Space to be located in the northwest quadrant of the PUD-KS
district as further described and located in the Eastern Cambridge Plan. The Public
Open Space shall be under the control of the City of Cambridge through fee simple
conveyance, easement, or other legal mechanism acceptable to the City. In the event
that the City of Cambridge does not accept the facility, the PUD permittee shall
maintain the park for the use of the general public as originally designed and
approved by the Planning Board in the Special Permit. The Public Open Space shall
be designed and constructed by the permittee according to the conditions of the PUD
special Permit and when conveyed to the City shall be environmentally and otherwise
suitable for the recreational uses for which it is designed.
However, where circumstances related to the transfer of property from the federal
government to other governmental or private entities (for the purpose of private
development on a portion or all of the land in the control of the federal government)
limit the feasibility of creation of a 7.5 acre park, the Planning Board may at its
discretion approve a Final Development Plan providing a contiguous Public Open
Space of less than 7.5 acres. In approving such a Final Development Plan the
Planning Board shall find that a smaller facility continues to meet the objectives of the
Eastern Cambridge Plan and the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines,
13.14.2 The Planning Board shall encourage development that is located adjacent to a Public
Open Space to be physically and functionally integrated with the open space by
means of building orientation, location of building entrances, pedestrian linkages
between major activity centers, and similar techniques.
13.15 Perimeter and transition. Any part of the perimeter of a PUD-KS which fronts on an
existing street or public open space should be so designed as to complement and
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk,
height, landscaping, and screening. Developments in the PUD-KS district should
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, with particularly strong linkages
among the riverfront, Kendall Square, and the Eastern Cambridge neighborhoods.
13.17 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development the PUD-KS District shall conform
to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, and in
the Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements applicable to the Residence C-3,
Office 3, Business B and Industry B districts, except as modified by this Section
13.17.

fronting on and having a public entrance onto a public street or a public open space,
located at the first floor level of a multistory building, and not exceeding 10,000 square
feet for each separately leased establishment shall not be required to provide any
accessory parking. Where parking is provided it shall be subject to Section 13.17.1
above.
13.18 Traffic Mitigation Measures. In reviewing a development proposal under the
provisions of this Section 13.70 and Section 19.20, the Planning Board shall
determine that the proponent has demonstrated, at the time of Final Development
Plan approval, a commitment to a Transportation Demand Management Program
consistent with the reduce parking mandated in this PUD. The measures to be taken
in this program must address:
(1) The amount of parking provided,
(2) The scale of development and the mix of uses proposed, and
(3) The assumptions employed with regard to the proportion of automobile use
for those traveling to the site.
For examples of such Measures, the Planning Board shall refer to the Eastern
Cambridge Plan, Article 18.000, and the requirements of Section 19.20 in establishing
Transportation Demand Management measures applicable to any approved PUD.
13.19 Relationship to MBTA Urban Ring Transportation Planning Project. In all PUD
application documents, the applicant shall indicate how the proposed PUD
development relates physically to the most current plans developed by the MBTA for
implementation of the Urban Ring transportation project.
13.110 Residential Uses Abutting Binney Street. Where any Development Proposal locates
residential dwellings along Binney Street, the Planning Board shall, in approving a
Final Development Plan containing such residential units, be satisfied that the
negative impacts of truck and other heavy vehicular traffic on Binney Street will be
adequately mitigated for the residents of the proposed dwelling units. Such mitigation
shall be achieved through the location of the buildings within the Development Parcel
13-8
and the distribution of activities within those buildings; the provision of setbacks,
landscaping and similar kinds of buffers; the inclusion of non-residential uses at the
ground floor; the employment of construction techniques to minimize the transmission
of sound and vibrations; and/or through the employment of any other appropriate
measures.
13-9

for review an application for a Special Permit based on a Development Proposal
which deviates from the aforesaid provisions of this Section 13.24.2, provided
that the Final Development Plan is in conformity with such provisions.
13.24.3 In evaluating a Development Proposal providing height in excess of sixty (60) feet, the
Planning Board shall give consideration to evidence presented on the following:
(a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will
unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the
vicinity to a significantly greater extent than it the building height did not exceed
sixty (60) feet;
(b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as
excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous
development;
(c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased
sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristics of the particular location
through more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to proposed and
existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the
proposed building;
(d) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of
traffic and parking on the surrounding area; and
13-11
(e) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure shall not otherwise
diminish the health and safety of the Harvard Square area.
13.25 Private open space. The minimum ratio of private open space to the total area of the
development parcel as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 shall be fifteen (15)

the development policies for The Front district specified in the East Cambridge
Riverfront Plan and is necessary to support the predominant uses in the PUD-2
district.
13.33 District Dimensional Regulations.
13.33.1 The maximum ratio of floor area to total area of the development parcel shall be 3.0;
however, the maximum ratio for a planned unit development in which seventy-five (75)
percent or more of the gross floor area of development will be devoted to multifamily
dwellings or townhouses shall be 4.0.
13.33.2 The minimum size of a development parcel shall be one acre (43,560 square feet.) A
development parcel within the PUD-2 district may contain noncontiguous lots

complement and to be connected with existing and planned public open space in the
district. Private open space oriented toward Cambridge Parkway and the riverfront
park between Cambridge Parkway and Commercial Avenue is preferred for
development parcels abutting those areas. In approving a final development plan, the
Planning Board may specify certain landscaping and other site design details to
assure that that the development will be compatible with public improvements in the
PUD-2 district and with the development policies outlined in the East Cambridge
Riverfront Plan.
13-14
13.36 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in a PUD-2 district shall conform to

provided that there is compliance with each of the following:
(a) the future parking structure will be constructed within the District but it may
be located either on or off of the lot;
(b) construction of the future parking structure will commence within three years
of the date of permit application for development on the lot;
(c) such future parking structure may be constructed and/or operated by the
applicant or by any public or private entity;
(d) the future parking structure will contain sufficient spaces reserved for users
of the lot to meet the parking requirements for the lot specified in
Subsections 13.36.1 and 13.36.2; and
(e) binding commitments shall exist to guarantee, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Planning Board that requirements (a) through (d) above shall be
satisfied. Such commitments shall be made by negotiated lease
agreement, deed restriction, covenant, performance bond, or comparable
legal instrument.

13-15
constructed for the planned unit development shall be as least equivalent to the
requirements specified in subsections 13.36.1 and 13.36.2.
13.40 PUD-3 AND PUD 3A DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.40, the following provisions apply equally
to all PUD-3 districts.
13.41 Purpose. The PUD-3 districts are intended to provide for the creation of a high quality
general and technical office environment which permits larger scale development and
supporting commercial activities and which encourages strong linkages between new
development at Kendall Square and along the East Cambridge riverfront. The PUD
3A District specifically is intended to permit larger scale development along the Binney
Street corridor, consistent with the scale of development permitted in the abutting
PUD-3 District, which also creates large areas of contiguous Public Open Space in the
PUD 3A district or in adjacent PUD Districts in order to create a better transition from
neighborhoods to commercial areas. As required by Section 13.48 and 13.59, any
Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel in a PUD-3A District containing
increased density and heights as described in Sections 13.43.1(2) and 13.44.4 shall
minimize noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally
sustainable buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks, an improved
pedestrian environment, pedestrian connections to public transit, and a sense of
neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting, lively, and active presence at
street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail, and other uses as part of the Final
Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior through-block connector space;
provide parking which is primarily located underground and is maintained at lower
ratios than customarily required by the Zoning Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface
parking lots and promote public transportation and other parking and traffic demand
measures which will reduce automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern
Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing
structures which add to the character of the neighborhood. Any such Final
Development Plan encompassing land area in excess of 10 acres is expected to be
constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to 20 years. By meeting these
requirements and providing large areas of contiguous Public Open Space, a Final
Development Plan in the PUD 3A district meeting these requirements will promote the
goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the public
health, safety, and welfare.
13.42 Uses Allowed in the PUD-3 Districts. The uses listed in this Section 13.42, alone or in
combination with each other, shall be allowed upon permission of the Planning Board.

Plan in which twenty-five (25) percent or more of the land area of the Development
Parcel is covered with such buildings or parts of buildings not exempted by Section
5.23 in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet in height or in which fifteen (15)
percent or more of the land areas of the Development Parcel is covered with such
buildings or parts thereof in excess of two hundred (200) feet in height.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its discretion, may accept for
review an application for a Special Permit based on a Development Proposal which
deviates from the aforesaid provisions of this Section 13.44.2, provided that the Final
Development Plan is in conformity with such provisions. Lower buildings or building
elements are encouraged closer to the Charles River while taller buildings or building
elements are encouraged closer to Kendall Square.
13.44.3 In the PUD-3 District, in evaluating a Development Proposal providing building height
in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give
consideration to evidence presented on the following:
(a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will
unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the
vicinity to a significantly greater extent that if the building height did not exceed
one hundred and twenty (120) feet;
(b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as
excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous
development;
(c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased
sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristic of the particular location
through more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to the proposed and
existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the
proposed building;
(d) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of traffic
and parking on the surrounding area; and
(e) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure would not otherwise
diminish the health and safety of the area around the development parcel.
13-19
13.44.4 In the PUD-3A District, the maximum height of any building shall be one hundred
twenty (120) feet, except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development
Plan with a building height within the PUD-3A District of one hundred forty (140) feet
subject to the requirements of Section 13.59.
13.45 Open Space. The minimum ratio of open space to the total area of the Development
Parcel as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 shall be fifteen (15) percent except
as modified below.
13.45.1 The Planning Board may reduce the open space requirement if the development is
located adjacent to a Public Open Space and if the development is physically and
functionally integrated with the Public Open Space by means of building orientation,
location of building entrances, pedestrian linkages between major activity centers, or
similar factors, or if the development provides for contiguous Public Open Space as
described in Section 13.59.
13.45.2 Open space shall include parks, plazas, landscaped areas open to the sky,
playgrounds, balconies, roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage, and
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified
by the Planning Board.
13.46 Perimeter and transition. Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk,
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-3 districts should
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages between
the riverfront and Kendall Square. Development in the PUD-3A District should
enhance the pedestrian experience along Binney Street. See Section 13.59.3
13.47 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-3 district shall conform
to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except
as modified by this Section 13.47. In the PUD-3A district these provisions shall be
further modified by Section 13.59 for any development subject to the provisions of
Section 13.59.
13.47.1 Off street parking facilities shall be provided as follows:
(1) Residence: Minimum number of spaces per group of dwelling units: 10 per
10.
(2) Public Assembly: Number of Seats requiring one space: 15.
13.47.2 Institutional, Retail and Office: Number of Square Feet of Gross Area Requiring One
Space:
(1) Institutional: 1,800 square feet
(2) Retail and Office:
Ground Floor: 900 square feet
13-20
Other level: 1,800 square feet.
13.47.3 The parking requirements of this Section 13.47, and as modified in Section 13.59 for
development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59, may be satisfied anywhere on
the Development Parcel, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article
6.000.
13.48 Where indicated in this Section 13.40, the provisions of Section 13.59 shall apply
equally in the PUD-3A District. The Planning Board shall include in any Special
Permit conditions that require ongoing compliance with any and all applicable
provisions of Section 13.59.
13.50 PUD-4, PUD-4A, PUD-4B and PUD-4C DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS
Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.50, the following provisions apply equally
to all PUD-4 Districts.
13.51.1 Purpose. The PUD-4, PUD-4A and PUD-4B districts are intended to provide the
opportunity for creation of a highly active, medium density commercial and residential
area with a mix of retail, office and residential uses. Development in the PUD-4, PUD4A
and PUD-4B districts shall be generally consistent with the policy objectives set
forth in the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the guidance
provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001 and
with the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated October 15, 2001. The PUD-4A and
4B districts specifically are intended to encourage a mix of uses with a substantial
component of housing, with the housing, where possible, located within the
development parcel adjacent to the existing residential neighborhood. In the PUD-4A
District reuse of existing historic industrial structures for mixed residential, retail and
office uses is encouraged. It is the intent of these Districts to encourage an active
urban setting around the Lechmere Canal and along public and private streets both
during and after customary business hours. Ground floor building spaces oriented
toward the Lechmere Canal and public streets should primarily contain retail or
consumer service office uses to the extent possible. Extensive ground level building
frontage along the Lechmere Canal developed to institutional or office uses is not
encouraged.
13.51.2 Purpose. The PUD-4C District is intended to provide for the creation of quality
development that enhances the pedestrian experience along Binney Street, creates a
transition between commercial development along the Binney Street corridor and
residential neighborhoods to the north, and creates large areas of contiguous Public
Open Space in the PUD-4C District or in adjacent PUD Districts. As required by
Section 13.59, any Final Development Plan in a PUD-4C District containing increased
density and heights as described in Sections 13.53.1(4) and 13.54.4 shall minimize
noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally sustainable
buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks and pedestrian connections to
public transit, and a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting,
lively and active presence at street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail and
13-21
other uses as part of the Final Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior
through-block connector space; provide parking which is primarily located
underground and is maintained at lower ratios than customarily required by the Zoning
Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface parking lots and promote the use of public
transportation and other parking and traffic demand measures which will reduce
automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated
October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing structures which add to the character
of the neighborhood. Any such Final Development Plan encompassing land area in
excess of 10 acres is expected to be constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to
20 years. By meeting these requirements and providing large areas of contiguous
Public Open Space, an approved Final Development Plan in the PUD 4C district will
promote the goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and
the public health, safety and welfare.
13.52 Uses Allowed in PUD-4 Districts. The uses listed in this Section 13.52, alone or in
combination shall be allowed. However, the amount and extent of uses may be
further regulated and limited in each PUD district as set forth elsewhere in this Section
13.50.
13.52.1 Residential Uses. All uses listed in Section 4.31 a-h, and i2.
13.52.2 Transportation, Communications and Utility Uses and Institutional Uses. All uses
listed in Sections 4.32 and 4.33, which are allowed or conditionally allowed in the
applicable base zoning districts.
13.52.3 Office and Laboratory Uses. All uses listed in Section 4.34.
13.52.4 Retail Business and Consumer Service Establishments. All uses listed in Section
4.35.
13.52.5 Open air or Drive in Retail and Service Uses.
(1) sales place for flowers, garden supplies, agricultural produce conducted
partly or wholly outdoors; commercial greenhouse or warehouse;
(2) open air place of entertainment;
(3) automobile service station where no major repairs are made provided that
all lubrication and repairs are carried out within the building and further
provided the service station will be located within or attached to a parking
garage or other structure as accessory use.
13.52.6 Other Uses. Any use not listed in Subsections 13.52.1 - 13.52.5 shall be allowed only
upon written determination by the Planning Board that such use is (1) compatible with
the Lechmere Canal and Square district in the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated
May, 1978 and the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan dated
October 2001 and the guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines
dated October 15, 2001 and (2) necessary to support the predominant uses in the
PUD-4 districts.
13-22
Certain additional uses may be permitted in the PUD-4C as set forth in Section 13.59
13.53 District Dimensional Regulations.
13.53.1 Maximum Floor Area Ratio. The maximum ratio of floor area to the total area of the
Development Parcel shall be as set forth below. For purposes of this Section 13.53.1,
residential use shall mean those uses set forth in Section 4.31 a-h.
(1) PUD-4 District: 2.0 for all uses, or the Gross Floor Area of the buildings
contained within the Development Parcel at the time of application for a
PUD special permit, whichever is greater.
(2) PUD-4A District: 2.5 for all uses, or the Gross Floor Area of the buildings
contained within the Development Parcel at the time of application for a
PUD special permit, whichever is greater. In no case, however, may nonresidential
uses, including hotels and motels, exceed fifty (50) percent of
the total GFA authorized by a PUD special permit.
(3) PUD-4B: For all uses an FAR twice that permitted for non-residential uses
in the applicable base zoning district (i.e. 2.0 in the Business A District; 2.5
in the Industry A-1 district). In no case, however, may the GFA of the nonresidential
uses, including hotels and motels, authorized by a PUD special
permit exceed that resulting from the application of the non-residential FAR
permitted in the applicable base zoning district to the PUD parcel area (i.e.
1.0 in a Business A district and 1.25 in an Industry A-1 district).
(4) PUD-4C District: 1.25 for all uses, except that the Planning Board may
approve a Final Development Plan with a maximum FAR exceeding 1.25
but not to exceed a maximum FAR of 3.0 where the Final Development
Plan meets the requirements of Section 13.59. Pursuant to Sections
13.59.4 and 13.59.9, certain building areas may be excluded from Gross
Floor Area for purposes of calculating such FAR.
13.53.2 Minimum Development Parcel. The minimum size of the Development Parcel for a
PUD shall be twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet. A Development Parcel within
the PUD-4 districts may contain non-contiguous lots elsewhere in any one of the PUD4
districts or within a contiguous PUD district.
For a Development Parcel within the PUD-4C District that is subject to the provisions
of Section 13.59, the minimum size shall be two (2) acres and may contain noncontiguous
lots elsewhere in the PUD-4C District, the PUD-3A District, and, solely for
the purpose of including lots to be dedicated to Public Open Space, the PUD-2
District.
There shall be no specified minimum lot size for lots located within a Development
Parcel. Planning Board approval of all lots located within a Development Parcel shall
be required.
13-23
13.53.3 Dwelling Unit Density. For the purpose of computing residential dwelling unit density,
the minimum land area for each dwelling unit shall be four hundred and fifty (450)
square feet. Residential density shall be computed based on the entire Development
Parcel. Wherever a residential FAR of 3.0 is permitted, the Planning Board may
increase the dwelling unit density to one unit per three-hundred (300) square feet of
land area.
13.53.4 Other Dimensions. There shall be no minimum width for the Development Parcel and
no minimum width for lots within the Development Parcel. There shall be no minimum
required front, rear and side yard requirements for a Development Parcel or for lots
located within a Development Parcel. The Planning Board shall approve all such
building setbacks.
Any development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59 shall be subject to the
following setback requirements:
(1) Four (4) feet from the Rogers Street streetline for any building facing
Rogers Street Park (see Section 13.59).
(2) Eight (8) feet for the first two stories and four (4) feet above the second
story, measured from the northerly street line of Binney Street between
Second Street and Third Street.
13.54 Maximum Height. The maximum height for any building shall be as set forth below:
(1) PUD-4 district: Eighty-five (85) feet.
(2) PUD-4A district: Sixty-five (65) feet except as provided for below:
(a) Alterations and additions within the footprint of any building or group
of abutting buildings existing on the site at the time of the application
for a PUD special permit may exceed sixty-five feet but may be no
higher than the highest portion of the existing buildings within the
Development Parcel.
(b) Building height shall be thirty-five (35) feet in that area bounded by
the centerline of Cambridge Street; then by a line easterly of, parallel
to and one hundred (100) feet distant from the westerly boundary
line of the PUD-4A; then the centerline of OBrien Highway; then the
westerly boundary line of the PUD-4A, to the point of origin.
(3) PUD-4B district: Sixty-five (65) feet except that between Thorndike Street
and Bent Street building height shall be forty-five (45) feet within 200 feet of
the easterly sideline of Second Street.
(4) PUD-4C District: Forty-five (45) feet north of the northerly sideline of
Rogers Street (subject to the limitation on buildings set forth in Section
13.59 below, where applicable) and Sixty-five (65) feet south of the
northerly sideline of Rogers Street, except the Planning Board may
13-24
approve a Final Development Plan with the following building heights,
subject to the provisions of Section 13.59:
(a) In the block bounded by Binney Street, Third Street, Rogers Street
and Second Street:
(i) A building height of eighty-five (85) feet for a building
devoted primarily to residential uses north of the northerly sideline
of Binney Street and within seventy-five (75) feet of the easterly
sideline of Third Street; and
(ii) A building height of seventy-eight (78) feet within one
hundred and thirtyeight (138) feet of the northerly sideline of
Binney Street, exclusive of the area described in Paragraph (i)
above.
(b) In the block bounded by Binney Street, Sixth Street, Rogers Street,
and Fifth Street: a building height of seventy-five (75) feet.
In approving heights in a PUD development the Planning Board shall be guided by the
intent of this Section 13.50 to provide transitions in height between the higher density
development along First and Binney Streets and lower density development and lower
height along Second Street adjacent to the residential neighborhood.
13.55 Open Space. The minimum ratio of open space to the total area of the Development
Parcel shall be twenty (20) percent except as modified below. The open space may
be any combination of Useable, Permeable, Green Area or Publicly Beneficial Open
Space as defined in Article 2.000 and further regulated in Section 5.22 of the
Ordinance.
13.55.1 The Planning Board may reduce the open space requirement if the development is
located adjacent to a Public Open Space and if the development is physically and
functionally integrated with that Public Open Space by means of building orientation,
location of building entrances, pedestrian linkages between major activity centers, or
similar factors. The open space requirement may also be reduced to the extent that
the Planning Board finds that such reduction facilitates preservation and reuse of
existing historic structures, facilitates the conversion of such structures to residential
use, or otherwise advances the urban design objectives as they apply to a PUDs
specific location. The Planning Board also may reduce the open space requirement if
the Final Development Plan conforms to the requirements and limitations of Section
13.59, as applicable.
13.55.2 Open space may include parks, plazas, landscaped areas open to the sky,
playgrounds, balconies, roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage, and
pedestrian ways, such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as permitted
by the Planning Board.
13-25
13.55.3 Open space at the ground level held in private ownership to serve the needs of
residents and employees of buildings within the PUD should be located and designed
to complement and to be connected with existing and planned Public Open Space in
the district. In approving a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board may specify
certain landscaping and other site design details to assure the PUD will be compatible
with public improvement in the districts and with the development policies outlined in
the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan dated May, 1978 and the Eastern Cambridge
Planning Study dated October 2001.
13.56 Perimeter and Transition. Any part of the perimeter of a planned unit development
which fronts on an existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to
complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density,
setback, bulk, height, landscaping and screening.
13.57 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-4 districts shall
conform to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000,
and in the Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements applicable to the
Residence C-3, Office 3, Business B and Industry B districts, except as modified by
Section 13.57.1 - 3 below. In the PUD-4C District these provisions shall be modified
by the parking provisions of Section 13.59 for any development subject to the
provisions of Section 13.59.
13.57.1 Off street parking facilities shall be provided as follows:
(1) Residence: 1 space per unit minimum, 1.5 spaces per unit maximum.
(2) Public Assembly: Number of seats requiring one space: 15.
(3) Institutional: 1 space per 1,800 square feet.
(4) Retail (except as noted in Section 13.57.2 below) and Office:
Ground floor: 1,125 square feet
Other level: 1,800 square feet
13.57.2 Ground Floor Retail and Customer Service Uses. Retail and customer service uses
fronting on and having a public entrance onto First Street, located at the first floor level
of a multistory building, and not exceeding 10,000 square feet for each separately
leased establishment shall not be required to provide any accessory parking. Where
parking is provided it shall be subject to Section 13.57.1 above.
13.57.3 The parking requirements specified in this Section 13.57 may be satisfied in total or in
part by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or
private consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or pooled private parking
facilities located within the Districts. The total number of parking spaces leased and
constructed for the planned unit development shall be at least equivalent to the
requirements specified in Article 6.000. The parking requirements specified in this
Section 13.57, as may be modified in Section 13.59 below for applicable development
13-26
also may be satisfied anywhere on the Development Parcel, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in Article 6.000.
13.58 Relationship to MBTA Urban Ring Transportation Planning Project. In all PUD
application documents, the applicant shall indicate how the proposed PUD
development relates physically to the most current plans developed by the MBTA for
implementation of the Urban Ring transportation project.
13.59 Special Requirements, Conditions and Standards Applicable to Certain Development
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-3A and PUD-4C Districts.
Where compliance with the provisions of this Section 13.59 is required by certain
provisions of Sections 13.40 and 13.50, the Planning Board shall approve a Final
Development Plan only after finding that in addition to all other applicable
requirements the following requirements have been met. The Planning Board shall, in
addition, include conditions in the approval of the Final Development Plan that will
ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements.
13.59.1 Rooftop Mechanical Equipment Noise Mitigation. Sound emanating from rooftop
mechanical equipment on all new structures in the approved Final Development Plan
shall be minimized by the adoption of best available and feasible practices regarding
the location and sizing of equipment, the selection of equipment and sound
attenuation measures.
At a minimum, any noise or vibration shall not be normally perceptible at ground level
without instruments at a distance of one hundred (100) feet from the source lot line
and buildings shall comply with the City of Cambridge Noise Ordinance.
In order to enforce these requirements, the applicant shall provide, in addition to the
Noise Mitigation narrative required as part of Article 19.000 review, acoustical reports
prepared by a professional acoustical engineer as described below:
(1) Prior to and as a condition of the issuance of the first certificate of
occupancy for a new building, an acoustical report, including field
measurements, demonstrating compliance of such building with all
applicable noise requirements; and
(2) Prior to obtaining any building permit to add any equipment having a
capacity greater than 5 horsepower to the rooftop, a narrative report
demonstrating that there will be continued compliance with all applicable
noise requirements after such addition, and upon completion of such
addition and as a condition to operation thereof, an acoustical report,
including field measurements, demonstrating such compliance.
13.59.2 Sustainability.
13-27
All new structures within a Final Development Plan shall be planned, designed and
constructed to be eligible to achieve at least the level Silver using the applicable
LEED Rating System of the United States Green Building Council in effect on January
1, 2009 (or any higher standard to which new buildings in the City of 50,000 square
feet or more are made subject by City Ordinance). An applicant subject to this
requirement shall provide to the Planning Board as part of its application for final
approval under Article 19.000 for any new building in an approved Final Development
Plan a completed LEED scorecard, with supporting documentation, demonstrating
that the new building will meet the requirements of this section.
13.59.3 Active Uses and Pedestrian Activity.
The Final Development Plan shall enhance the public pedestrian usage of the
sidewalks and create a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting,
lively and active presence at street level. Accordingly, portions of the ground floors of
buildings in locations such as the ones enumerated below, or comparable locations,
shall generally be planned, designed, constructed and used for Active Uses (defined
below). At a minimum, at least 20,000 square feet shall be developed Active Uses.
13.59.31 Definition of Active Uses. For purposes of this Section 13.59, Active Uses means:
(1) Retail sales and services listed in Sections 4.35 and 4.36;
(2) Restaurants, and establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold and
consumed, listed in Section 4.35;
(3) Mixed-Mode Transportation Hub, which shall mean a facility which shall
include a bicycle storage and bicycle service facility, convenient access to
a car-sharing program, and a shuttle bus stop and a protected waiting
area for shuttle buses to public transit facilities; and
(4) Other uses which the Planning Board determines meet the goals of this
Section 13.59.3.
13.59.32 Location of Active Uses.
While Active Uses are desirable and encouraged at many locations throughout a
Development Parcel located in a PUD-3A or PUD-4C district, potential locations of
Active Uses of particular merit include the following locations for the portion of the
Development Parcel within the PUD-3A District:
(1) Portions of buildings and sites adjacent to the intersection of Binney Street
and Second Street (including a Mixed-Mode Transportation Hub, as
defined above); and
(2) Portions of buildings and sites facing First Street across from the Triangle
Park (as defined below).
Potential locations of Active Uses of particular merit include the following location for
the portion of the Development Parcel within the PUD-4C District:
13-28
(3) Portions of buildings and sites adjacent to the intersection of Binney Street
and Third Street.
The Planning Board shall have flexibility in approving the actual location of Active
Uses in the Final Development Plan. In order to preserve such flexibility, all ground
floor space in an approved Final Development Plan, whether or not in one of the
potential locations for Active Uses described above, shall contain design features
which could accommodate future Active Uses.
13.59.33 Building and Site Design Requirements for Active Uses and Open Spaces.
(1) Each Active Use shall have at least one entrance from the sidewalk
separate from the principal entrance of the building.
(2) Where the length of a commercial buildings primary façade exceeds 135
feet, loading, service, and garage ramp areas shall occur behind no more
than one third (1/3) of ground level façade length facing a park. Along the
remaining two-thirds (2/3) of ground level façade length, transparent
glazing shall make up at least 40% of ground-level façade area, and areas
of opaque wall may extend no more than 25 feet horizontally.
Notwithstanding these design requirements, it is preferred that parking
entries and service facilities not be located within that portion of a building
facing Rogers Street Park.
(3) In order to provide open and inviting public access between buildings and
sidewalks, a Final Development Plan shall contain attractive exterior
through-block connector space in the block bounded by Binney Street,
Second Street, Rogers Street and Third Street (where that area is
encompassed by the Development Parcel) and shall provide for the
expansion and enhancement of the existing through-block connector in the
block bounded by Binney Street, Second Street, Linskey Way and Third
Street (where that area is encompassed by the Development Parcel).
Exterior connector space shall be open to the public at all times.
(4) Outdoor courtyards, delineated gathering space, or sitting areas are
encouraged throughout the Development Parcel in any approved Final
Development Plan.
13.59.34 Required Marketing Plan.
An approved Final Development Plan shall include a marketing and merchandising
plan to be implemented over the life of the permit in order to recruit users and
otherwise use diligent efforts to cause ground floor areas of buildings and adjacent
sites as approved in the Final Development Plan to be occupied by Active Uses.
Among other things, the marketing plan shall (1) set forth target uses and users (and
shall particularly target local and/or independent retailers), (2) designate an individual
responsible for implementing the plan who shall serve as a point of contact with the
Community Development Department (through its Economic Development Division),
13-29
(3) describe the types of economic incentives which may be offered to tenants such as
rental and fit-up allowances, and (4) include a street activation plan.
The Planning Board shall require in its conditions of approval an annual reporting to
the Community Development Department, until the later of three years after full
occupancy of all required Active Use space and ten years after the issuance of the
first building permit for a building in the Final Development Plan, regarding the
ongoing efforts on the part of the Permittee to comply with such plans. The Permittee
shall revise the marketing and management plan as necessary to achieve full
occupancy of all required Active Use space within a reasonable period of time.
13.59.4 Required Housing.
The Final Development Plan shall provide for at least 220,000 square feet of gross
floor area to be devoted to residential uses. The residential units shall contain at least
47,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area of housing affordable to middle income
households whose total income does not exceed one hundred twenty (120%) percent
of the median income for the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area and at
least 33,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area of housing affordable to low and
moderate income households whose total income does not exceed eighty (80%)
percent of the median income for the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The residential uses shall be constructed in accordance with the following schedule:
(1) Construction of the first 70,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area of required
residential uses must commence prior to the issuance of a building permit
allowing non-residential Gross Floor Area in excess of 767,000 square feet
of non-residential Gross Floor Area in the aggregate.
(2) Construction of the remaining 150,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area of
required residential uses shall commence no later than the later of (a)
issuance of a building permit allowing non-residential Gross Floor Area in
excess of 1,000,000 square feet of non-residential Gross Floor Area in the
aggregate or (b) eight years after the grant of a Special Permit approving a
Final Development Plan.
The required 220,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area devoted to residential uses
shall be excluded from Gross Floor Area for the purposes of calculating Floor Area
Ratio (FAR). The required residential Gross Floor Area shall not be subject to the
provisions of Section 11.200 of the Zoning Ordinance. The required residential Gross
floor Area shall specifically not be eligible for the FAR and dwelling unit bonuses set
forth in Section 11.203.2.
Notwithstanding the exclusion of the 220,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area to be
devoted to residential uses from the provisions of Section 11.200, the required low
and moderate income units shall be constructed, marketed and administered in
conformance with the requirements, policies and procedures established by the City
for units otherwise subject to Section 11.200.
13-30
Residential Gross Floor Area approved in the Final Development Plan exceeding
220,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area shall be subject to the FAR limitations of the
PUD Districts and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11.200.
13.59.41 Incentive Zoning Provisions.
A PUD Final Development Plan subject to the provisions of this Section 13.59 shall
provide to the Cambridge community significant material benefits in the form of,
among other things, a significant component of housing serving households with a
wide range of incomes at least equivalent to the housing which would have been
provided pursuant to Sections 11.203.1 and 11.203.2, as well as providing the land for
two large public parks and the funds to design and construct improvements thereon,
an active program to establish and support retail activities within the development,
donation of an existing building to the City of Cambridge with a preference for its use
for municipal or community use, and measures to monitor and manage noise
generation within the development; therefore, any such Final Development Plan shall
not be subject to the requirements of Section 11.203.1 and 11.203.2 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
13.59.5 Parking.
The approved Final Development Plan shall provide for parking for non-residential
uses in new buildings at a ratio no greater than .9 spaces per 1,000 feet of Gross
Floor Area for retail and office uses (including technical office and laboratory uses).
The Planning Board may allow, consistent with the provisions of Section 6.35, parking
at a ratio which is less than 1 space per dwelling unit for any residential use. All
parking for nonresidential uses shall be underground structured parking, provided that
a Development Parcel may contain on grade parking equal in number to 5% of the
parking otherwise required for the uses in the Final Development Plan (but in no event
more than 60 spaces). In its approval of a Final Development Plan, the Planning
Board may approve the location, layout and design of parking spaces which deviate
from the requirements of Article 6.000 of this Ordinance.
13.59.51 Interim Use of Surface Parking
On an interim basis in anticipation of later construction of underground structured
parking sufficient to meet all parking requirements, on grade open parking shall be
allowed in a Development Parcel subject to the following conditions:
(1) The future underground parking structure will be constructed within the
Development Parcel but it may be located either on or off of the lot which it
will serve;
(2) Construction of the replacement subsurface parking structure will
commence within four years of the date of certificate of occupancy for the
building initially served by on grade parking;
13-31
(3) The future subsurface parking structure will contain sufficient spaces for
users of the building initially served by on grade open parking so as to
meet the parking requirements for such building; and
(4) Binding commitments shall exist to establish, to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Planning Board, that requirements (1) through (3) above shall be
satisfied. Such commitments shall be made by negotiated lease
agreement, deed restriction, covenant, or comparable legal instrument.
13.59.52 Accessory Parking for Uses Outside the Development Parcel
The Planning Board may approve in the Final Development Plan underground
structured parking spaces as replacements for pre-existing spaces that will be
displaced by improvements contemplated by such Final Development Plan.
In addition, notwithstanding any provisions of the Zoning Ordinance to the contrary, in
the event that any pre-existing accessory off-street parking facilities located in a
Development Parcel, that are serving a pre-existing use located outside the
Development Parcel (whether within or outside the applicable PUD district), are
proposed to be eliminated or displaced in accordance with the Final Development
Plan, such pre-existing off-street parking may be relocated by Special Permit granted
by the Planning Board to the owner of the off-site use. In granting such Special
Permit, the Planning Board may grant deviations from the requirements of Article
6.000 of this Ordinance for the number, location, layout and design of the relocated
parking spaces
13.59.6 Consistency with Design Guidelines.
The Final Development Plan shall be generally consistent with the guidance provided
in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001, provided that in
the event of any conflict between such Design Guidelines and this Ordinance, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall govern. Application of such Design Guidelines may
vary within the context of specific building proposals in a way that, nevertheless,
respects the intent of such Design Guidelines and this Ordinance. Accordingly,
variations from the Design Guidelines may be approved so long as it is demonstrated
that the alternate approach serves as well or better the objectives of the PUD-3A and
PUD-4C Districts or creates positive design opportunities not envisioned in the Design
Guidelines. In granting approval under Article 19.000 for all buildings in a Final
Development Plan subject to this Section 13.59, the Planning Board may approve
buildings for which physical design information is presented in conceptual form,
subject to later design review and approval by the Planning Board and a finding that
final design of such buildings is consistent with such Design Guidelines as aforesaid,
and such other design goals as are set forth in this Ordinance and the Special Permit
approving such Final Development Plan.
13.59.7 Preservation.
In the event that all or any portion of a lot listed below is included in a Final
Development Plan, the exterior of the currently existing structure thereon shall not be
13-32
demolished but shall be preserved in place for adaptive re-use during its useful life (or
relocated, as noted):
(1) 140-146 Sixth Street (The building at the corner of Sixth Street and Rogers
Street on Tax Parcel 28-23)
(2) 213 Binney Street (The building on the corner of Binney Street and Fifth
Street on Tax Parcel 28-23 but not including the building on such Tax
Parcel known as 126 Rogers Street)
(3) 161 First Street (excluding three story rear addition) (Tax Parcel 16-20)
(4) 41 Linskey Way (Also known as 219 Second Street) (Building may be
moved to another location, in compliance with all applicable laws) (Tax
Parcel 15-11)
13.59.8 Letter of Commitment.
Issuance of any base building permit or certificate of occupancy for any building in the
Final Development Plan shall be conditioned upon certification by all relevant
departments of the City to the Superintendent of Buildings that the Project is
proceeding in accordance with all provisions of that certain Letter of Commitment
dated February 9, 2009.
13.59.9 Required Public Open Space Features.
Where compliance with this Section 13.59 in required by any provision of Sections
13.40 and 13.50 of the Zoning Ordinance, the following Public Open Space to be
dedicated to the City of Cambridge shall be required in the approved Final
Development Plan:
(1) In the block bounded by Rogers Street, Third Street, and Second Street
(Tax Parcels 16-25, 16-27 and 16-1), a Public Open Space no less than
two (2) acres in size in the aggregate (Rogers Street Park).
(2) In the block bounded by Land boulevard, First Street, Binney Street and
Monroe Street Extension (Tax Parcel 11-32) and the block bounded by
Land Boulevard, First Street and Munroe Street Extension (Tax Parcel 1146),
a Public Open Space no less than 0.30 acres in size in the aggregate
(Triangle Park).
13.59.91 Timing of the Permanent Dedication of Required Public Open Space.
The required Public Open Space shall be permanently dedicated to the City of
Cambridge by a legal device or instrument acceptable to the City, with all buildings
and foundations removed, and in an environmental condition consistent with all
federal, state and local laws, rules, and regulations for all uses to which Public Open
Space is intended to be put, including, but not limited to (in the case of the Rogers
Street Park), unrestricted excavation for purposes of construction of recreational
13-33
buildings and facilities and landscaping, and (in the case of the Triangle Park),
unrestricted excavation for purposes of construction and installation of sidewalks,
poles, walls, fences, landscaping and similar site improvements. The open space
shall be dedicated to the City on the following schedule:
(1) In the case of the Rogers Street Park, no later than the issuance of the first
certificate of occupancy for the first non-residential building constructed in
the approved Final Development Plan.
(2) In the case of the Triangle Park, no later than the issuance of certificates of
occupancy for non-residential buildings in the Final Development Plan that
in the aggregate of such building construction contain at least 700,000
square feet of Gross Floor Area.
The dedication of the required Public Open Space shall be accomplished
by transfer of ownership of the required lots to the City in fee simple
absolute, subject to encumbrances acceptable to the City which do not
interfere with the use of the land for its intended purposes such as
subsurface utility easements. If the City does not accept such transfer of
ownership, then the Permitee, or its successors and assigns, shall hold the
land as Public Open Space available to the public in perpetuity for all uses
and activities identified in the definition of Public Open Space in this Zoning
Ordinance. The development of the Public Open Space, whether or not
ownership is transferred to the City, shall be designed and its use shall be
programmed and controlled by the City of Cambridge. No building other
than any building constructed by the City ancillary to the use of the site
shall be constructed on the lots so dedicated as Public Open Space. The
Gross Floor Area of any such buildings shall be excluded from Gross Floor
Area for purposes of calculating Floor Area Ratio.
13.59.10 Donation of an Existing Building with a preference for its use for Municipal or
Community Uses.
Any Final Development Plan shall provide for the transfer of ownership to the City of
Cambridge of the existing building and lot identified as 101 Rogers Street (also known
as 117 Rogers Street and as the Foundry Building) (Tax Parcel 27-82), with a
preference for its use for municipal or community uses as generally set forth in
Section 4.33 of the Table of Use Regulations, at least 10,000 square feet of which
shall be devoted to educational, cultural or institutional uses listed in Section 4.33 of
the Table of Use Regulations, at a time and in a form acceptable to the City. Such
transfer shall include the full development rights attendant to such lot at an FAR of 3.0
as generally permitted within the applicable PUD. Upon the execution of such transfer
of ownership, the PUD Permittee shall be entitled to 43,684 square feet of additional
Gross Floor Area for non-residential or residential development within the approved
Final Development Plan above that otherwise permitted through application of the
FAR limitations set forth in the PUD-3A and 4C Districts, and if ownership of a portion
of up to 5,254 square feet of the lot identified as 249 Third Street (Tax Parcel 27-76) is
transferred to the City of Cambridge, upon the execution of such transfer of
13-34
ownership, the PUD Permittee shall be entitled to additional Gross Floor Area, as well,
equal to the product of 3 times the number of square feet of such portion of such lot.
Such Gross Floor Area may be included in the approved Final Development Plan,
notwithstanding that such approval may precede the actual transfer of the property to
the City.

13.70 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTH POINT RESIDENCE DISTRICT.
13.71 Purpose. This Section 13.70 is intended to provide the opportunity to create a new
residential neighborhood from an area now primarily industrial in character. Retail and
office uses and community services are encouraged as part of that neighborhood to
serve the residential community and stimulate activity in the area for extended hours
throughout the day. Significant new public open space to serve the residents of the
district and the general public is desired. It is also intended that development in the
PUD in the North Point Residence District will be generally consistent with the policy
objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and guidance provided in the
Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.
13.72 Applicability. A special permit for a Planned Unit Development may be granted by the
Planning Board in the North Point Residence District in accordance with the
requirements of Sections 12.30 and 12.40, and the development controls specified in
Section 12.50 and this Section 13.70. All references to and requirements for a PUD
district in those sections shall also apply to a Planned Unit Development in the North
Point Residence District.
13.73 Use Regulations. Any use permitted in Article 16.000 - North Point Residence District
may be allowed by the Planning Board, but subject only to the requirements and
limitations of this Section 13.70. Other uses, not permitted in Article 16.000 but
permitted in a Business B District, may be allowed by the Planning Board upon a
written determination that such use is compatible with and advances the policy
objectives of the Eastern Cambridge Plan and that it is necessary to support the
predominant residential use in the PUD in the North Point Residence District.
However, except as set forth in Section 13.73.0 below, non-residential uses may not
constitute more than thirty-five (35) percent of the total authorized Gross Floor Area
within any Development Parcel, exclusive of both Gross Floor Area devoted to parking
facilities and the additional Gross Floor Area (GFA) that may be constructed as a
result of the application of FAR bonuses permitted in Section 11.200.
13.73.0 Special Permit for Non-residential Uses. The Planning Board may permit up to one
hundred (100) percent of the total authorized Gross Floor Area within a Development
Parcel to consist of non-residential uses if there is only one (1) building proposed to
be located within the Development Parcel.
13-35
13.73.1 Special Provisions Related to Permitted Retail Uses.
The total Gross Floor Area for retail and consumer service establishments authorized
by the Planning Board in all approved PUDs within that portion of the PUD in the North
Point Residence District located west of Charlestown Avenue shall not exceed 75,000
square feet or 25,000 square feet for that portion of the PUD located east of
Charlestown Avenue, unless a finding is made by the Planning Board that additional
retail use will better serve the objectives of this Section 13.70 and the objectives of the
Eastern Cambridge Plan. All retail and consumer services establishments shall be
subject to the following limitations:
(i) In no instance shall any individual retail or consumer service establishment exceed
10,000 gross square feet unless the Planning Board determines in writing that
establishments of a greater size better support and serve the residents within the
PUD district and better advance the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern
Cambridge Plan and the guidance proved in the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines.
(ii) No off street parking is provided except that the Planning Board, in approving a
Final Development Plan, may explicitly permit accessory off street parking not to
exceed one space per two thousand (2,000) square feet of Gross Floor Area
approved for retail and consumer service establishments, provided that mitigating
measures are included to ensure that the goals of the district will be met.
(2) The initial 50,000 square feet of retail and consumer service establishments
authorized in total in approved PUDs shall be exempt from any limitations as to nonresidential
Gross Floor Area as set forth in Section 13.73.1 above subject to the
following limitations:
(i) The GFA is located on the ground floor and fronts on and has a public entry onto a
publicly accessible street.
(ii) The establishment is located within the 500-radius described in Section 13.74.11
below.
13.73.2 Limitations on Telephone Exchange Uses. Where the floor area of any such use exceeds
400 square feet, the use shall only be located within 250 feet of the Boston/
Somerville/Cambridge municipal boundary line and west of Charlestown Avenue.
13.74 Dimensional Requirements.
13.74.1 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Limitation. The maximum ratio of Gross Floor Area to the total
area of the Development Parcel, which area shall be calculated in accordance with
Section 13.74.2 below, shall be 2.4 except as modified by Sections 13.74.11 
13.74.12 below. Any GFA contained within the head house or transit station serving
the MBTA Green Line, excluding any GFA occupied by private retail, office, or other
uses, shall not be subject to the FAR limitations set forth in this Section 13.74.1.
13-36
Where a Development Parcel encompasses lots to which different FAR and nonresidential
use limitations apply, the FAR and non-residential use limitation regulations
shall be used only to determine the total amount of GFA permitted including the GFA
devoted to residential and non-residential uses. Those FAR and non-residential use
regulations shall not regulate or limit the distribution of the authorized GFA or uses
within the Development Parcel as a whole. That distribution shall be determined by
the Planning Board in its approval of the Final Development Plan.
13.74.11 Additional FAR for Proximity to Transit. For any portion of a Development Parcel
located within a 500-foot radius of a point defined as the intersection of the centerline
of McGrath and OBrien Highway and the northerly extension of the centerline of First
Street, the permitted FAR shall be 3.0. That portion of said Development Parcel shall
be permitted to use up to 35% of the allowable FAR for non-residential uses. The
portions of the development parcel outside the 500-foot radius shall be subject to the
limitations of Sections 13.74.1 and 13.74.12. The additional GFA permitted by this
Section 13.74.11 must be located within the portion of the development parcel located
within the 500-foot radius; provided that the Planning Board may allow such additional
GFA to be located outside of the 500-foot radius upon determining that such
relocation of GFA would further the establishment of an active retail plaza near
Lechmere Station. (See Map 13.81)
13.74.12 Additional FAR for Increased Residential Use. For those portions of the PUD district
not located within the 500-foot radius described in Section 13.74.11, the FAR
permitted in Section 13.74.1 may be increased according to the schedule set forth
below as the proportion of GFA devoted to residential uses increases, as proposed in
the application for a PUD special permit and approved by the Planning Board.
Proportion of Residential GFA Permitted FAR
Proposed and Approved
All residential 3.0
No less than 90% 2.9
No less than 85% 2.8
No less than 80% 2.7
No less than 75% 2.6
No less than 70% 2.5
No less than 65% 2.4
To attain the increase in FAR, the proposed development must attain the percentage
thresholds indicated above. There shall be no partial application of the gradations
noted above.
13.74.2 Minimum Development Parcel Size. The minimum size of the Development Parcel
shall be the larger of (1) one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet or (2) seventyfive
percent of the area of a lot or combination of lots (a) in existence as of June 1,
2001 and (b) held in common ownership where it is proposed to incorporate any
portion of such lot or lots within the Development Parcel provided that clause (2) shall
not apply to a lot or combination of lots owned by The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts or a department thereof as of June 1, 2001. The area of a
13-37
development parcel may include land dedicated (after adoption of this Section 13.70
and prior to the issuance of any building permit for work under a PUD special permit
under this Section 13.70) by the owner or former owner of the land, whether in fee or
by easement, deed restriction, covenant or comparable legal instrument enforceable
by the City of Cambridge or other public entity, as a public way, private way open to
public use, or public open space.
13.74.21 Where the Development Parcel required in Section 13.74.2 is greater than 100,000
square feet, the applicant may at his own discretion designate a portion of
Development Parcel as a Master Plan Area, within which area physical information
may be presented in a more generalized way, subject to more detailed approval by
the Planning Board at a time and in a manner determined by the Board in its PUD
special permit decision. Within the Master Plan Area location of streets and public
parks, the quantities of proposed land uses, general building envelopes, locations and
heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board can reasonably
assess the impact of the Master Plan and its general consistency with the objectives
of the PUD district and the guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines.
13.74.3 Maximum Building Height. The maximum height of buildings in the PUD district shall
be eighty-five (85) feet except as otherwise shown on the PUD in the North Point

Section 13.74.3(1)(a), any portion of a building that is within fifty (50) feet of an
existing or proposed Public Open Space or single intervening street abutting that
open space may exceed 65 feet only if for each floor above 65 feet, that floor is set
back an additional 10 feet from the façade of the floor below, until the maximum
height is attained, or until a 20 foot setback from the façade at 65 feet is attained.
Alternately, a set back of 20 feet from the façade of the building at a height of 65 feet
shall be permitted, and the remaining portions of the building allowed to achieve the
maximum height permitted by Section 13.74.3, or any variation between the two
provisions.
13.74.32 Additional Height to Two-hundred and Twenty Feet. The Planning Board may in its
discretion permit no more than seven residential buildings (in addition to those

(220) feet in that portion of the PUD in the North Point Residence District west of
Charlestown Avenue, subject to the following limitations.
(1) All such buildings shall be located in that portion of the PUD in the North Point
Residence District where the base height for all buildings is one hundred and fifty
feet, provided that portions of such buildings may be located in other municipalities
and, as to the portion(s) in another municipality only, governed by the zoning
regulations of the other municipality.
(2) When approving the building heights permitted under this Section 13.74.32, the
Planning Board shall determine that portions of any such buildings above sixty-five
feet are appropriately separated from each other.
13-39
13.74.33 Additional Height to Two-hundred and Fifty Feet. The Planning Board may in its
discretion permit no more than two residential buildings to exceed one hundred and
fifty feet in height up to a maximum height of two hundred and fifty (250) feet in that
portion of the PUD in the North Point Residence District east of Charlestown Avenue,
subject to the following limitations.
(1) All such buildings shall be located in that portion of the PUD in the North Point
Residence District where the base height for all buildings is one hundred and fifty
feet.
13.74.34 Description of Reference Lines. Reference Line #1 and Reference Line #2 shall be
as described herein:
(1) Reference Line #1 is that line which is the northwesterly extension of the
centerline of North point Boulevard that, at its intersection with Reference Line #2, is
deflected south by 22* degrees and continues thereafter to its intersection with the
Special District 1 zoning district boundary line. (*scriveners error corrected
2/14/11)
(2) Reference Line #2 is that line which is northwesterly of, parallel to, and nine
hundred (900) feet distant from the northwesterly sideline of Charlestown Avenue.
13.74.35 Waiver of Height Limitations
In order to provide a limited level of flexibility in developing a comprehensive plan for
currently vacant or underdeveloped parcels of land in North Point, the Planning Board
may accept a (preliminary) Development Proposal and may approve a Final
Development Plan in which one or more buildings or portions of buildings, no higher
than one hundred and fifty (150) feet, do not conform to the height limitations set forth
in Section 13.74.3 above, subject to the following limitations and conditions.
(1) The building or portion of a building does not extend more than 100 feet into
the adjacent, more restrictive height band as set forth in Section 13.74.3 and
illustrated on Map 13.71.
(2) The building or portion of a building extending into the more restrictive height
band does not exceed the height limit established in the less restrictive height
band from which it is being extended.
(3) Such extensions are limited in nature, not inconsistent with the objective of
establishing the height band provisions of Section 13.74.3, and are generally
consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.
(4) Other buildings proposed can be demonstrated to be lower than might
otherwise be required should the height waiver not be granted by the Planning
Board.
(5) The applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that
the requested deviations from the height provisions of Section 13.74.3 are
reasonable in the context of the proposed Final Development Plan as a whole
and permit an organization of buildings, streets, opens space and other features
of the Final Development Plan that better serve the public interest and the
13-40
objectives of the PUD than might otherwise be the case with strict adherence to
the height limits established in Section 13.74.3
13.74.36 In the event that two or more height limitation provisions (as set forth in Sections
13.74.3 (1) and (2), 13.74.31, and 13.74.35 above) apply to a single parcel of land
defined and approved by the Planning Board as part of a Master Plan and intended
to be developed singly and separate from other approved parcels in the Master plan
and located within 700 feet of the northwesterly sideline of Charlestown Avenue and
within 400 feet south of Reference Line #1, the total allowable massing of a structure
on that parcel, as limited in the Master Plan, may be distributed and allocated across
the entire parcel without regard to the restrictions set forth in the above referenced
Sections to the extent that it furthers the purpose of this Section 13.70 and provided
that neither the maximum allowable height applicable on the parcel by the above
referenced Sections nor the maximum allowable square footage at the parcel are
exceeded. Such redistribution of height may be approved by the Planning Board as
part of any design review of individual buildings in the manner set forth in the
approved Master Plan.
13.74.4 Other Dimensional Requirements. There shall be no specified minimum lot size for
lots located within a Development Parcel. There shall be no minimum lot area per
dwelling unit requirement. There shall be no requirement with respect to minimum lot
widths or minimum front, side or rear yards in the District. The Planning Board shall
approve all proposed building setbacks and lot configurations.
13.75 Open Space. Any combination of Public Open Space, Green Area Open Space or
Permeable Open Space, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be provided on every
Development Parcel and shall in the aggregate equal at least twenty (20) percent of
the area of such Development Parcel. Owners of adjacent Development Parcels may
collectively provide such open space by dedication, easement, deed restriction,
covenant, or comparable legal instrument enforceable by the City of Cambridge or
other public entity, in which event each such development parcel shall, for purposes
of this Section 13.70 be deemed to include such portion of such open space as such
owners shall allocate to it in such legal instrument. This open space requirement shall
be subject to the following provisions.
(1) All required open space shall be generally accessible to the public for reasonable
periods throughout the day for the purposes for which the open space is designed and
approved by the Planning Board, which may include but not be limited to walking,
bicycling, active and passive recreation. The Planning Board must approve any
proposal to significantly limit public access to the required open space.
13.75.1 Required Public Open Space. Any approved Planned Unit Development whose
Development Parcel consists in part or entirely of a lot or combination of lots (a) in
existence as of June 1, 2001, (b) held in common ownership, and (c) is at least
250,000 square feet in size shall be obligated to allocate a portion of its open space
requirement as set forth in Section 13.75 above as Public Open Space meeting the
requirements set forth in Section 13.75.11 below. This obligation shall remain with
such lot or combination of lots in its entirety, notwithstanding any subdivision or
change of ownership that may occur after June 1, 2001. In each instance where such
a lot or combination of lots, or a portion thereof, is included within a development
parcel, the PUD special permit shall only be granted if it is established to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board that the Public Open Space required in this Section
13.75.1 can be provided even if its location is on a portion of the lot or combination of
lots not included within the Development Parcel under review.
13-41
13.75.11 Requirements of the Public Open Space. The required Public Open Space shall
consist of a contiguous parcel of land of at least two and one half (2.5) acres in size at
a location and designed in a manner consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Plan. As
defined, the Public Open Space shall be within the control of the City of Cambridge
through fee simple conveyance, easement, or other legal mechanism acceptable to
the City. The Planning Board in its conditions shall establish the time by which the
facility shall be completed. In the event that the City of Cambridge does not accept
the facility, the PUD permittee shall maintain the park for the use of the general public
as originally designed and approved by the Planning Board in the Special Permit. The
Public Open Space shall be designed and constructed by the permittee according to
the conditions of the PUD Special Permit and when conveyed to the city shall be
environmentally and otherwise suitable for the recreational uses for which it is
designed.
Only one facility of 2.5 acres or greater shall be required within the North Point PUD
District. Once the Public Open Space obligation has be met, any remaining open
space required for any PUD need only be consistent with the requirements of Section
13.75 and the applicable guidelines of the Eastern Cambridge Plan. The required
facility shall be created according to the following rules.
(1) Where the Development Parcel includes a lot or combination of lots defined in
13.75.1 above where that lot or combination of lots is at least 250,000 square feet in
area but less than ten acres, and where the development parcel encompasses a
portion of the site of the required Public Open Space as illustrated in the Eastern
Cambridge Plan, the open space required in the PUD shall be allocated in the
approved Final Development Plan in part or in full at the proposed location of the
Public Open Space.
(2) Where the PUD Development Parcel includes all or a portion of a lot or
combination of lots with an area greater than 10 acres, the PUD Final Development
Plan shall be required to create in its entirety a 2.5-acre Public Open Space
consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Plan; if development of a 2.5-acre Public Open
Space has previously occurred in whole or in part, that portion of the Public Open
Space not designated in any previously approved PUD shall be provided.
13.76 Parking and Loading Requirements. Off-street parking and loading requirements shall
be the same as currently specified in Article 6.000 and in the Schedule of Parking and
Loading Requirements applicable to the Residence C-3, Office 3, Business B and
Industry B districts, except as modified below.
13.76.1 Parking facilities may be located on the lot they serve or may be located in whole or in
part in one or more pooled private or public parking facilities located anywhere within
the PUD in the North Point Residence District.
13.76.2 Parking and loading requirements shall be as follows:
(1) Residential Uses: 1 space per unit minimum and 1.5 spaces per unit
maximum.
(2) General Office Uses: 1 space per 1,250 gross square feet minimum and 1
space per 625 gross square feet maximum.
(3) Technical Office for Research and Development Uses: 1 space per 1,675
gross square feet minimum and 1 space per 840 gross square feet maximum.
13-42
(4) Retail and Consumer Services: No accessory parking shall be required if the
retail and consumer service uses are located on the ground floor and front on
and have a public entry directly onto a publicly accessible street.
13.76.21 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.76.2 above, the total number of parking
spaces serving non-residential uses in the PUD in the North Point Residence District
shall not exceed 2,500 spaces, allocated to each Development Parcel at the rate of
1.2 spaces per 1,000 square feet of land in the Development Parcel.
13.77 Approval of Roadway Plan. No Final Development Plan shall be approved by the
Planning Board without Planning Board approval of a Roadway Plan. The Planning
Board shall not approve a Roadway Plan (which shall include all proposed roads,
streets, driveways and other motor vehicle circulation routes) as part of the Final
Development Plan unless the Planning Board finds that the impact of traffic projected
to use the approved roadways is consistent with the objective of the PUD in the North
Point Residence District to limit the extent of single occupancy vehicle access to the
district and is consistent with the traffic findings required in Section 19.20  Project
Review Special Permit.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.22.4, all accessory parking for
development approved in a Final Development Plan shall be provided within the
approved PUD area unless the Planning Board specifically allows accessory parking
at other locations, consistent with all other provisions of Article 6.000.
13.78 Other Provisions
13.78.1 Signs. The sign regulations of Article 7.000 applicable to Retail, and Office Districts
shall be applicable in the District.
13.78.2 Perimeter and Transition. Any part of the perimeter of a planned unit development
which fronts on a public open space for not less than two hundred and fifty (250) feet
or is immediately adjacent to and within three hundred (300) feet of the Charles River
shall be so designed as to complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses
(existing or proposed) with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, height,
landscaping, and screening.
13.78.3 Traffic Mitigation Measures. In reviewing a development proposal under the
provisions of this Section 13.70 and Section 19.20, the Planning Board shall
determine that the proponent has demonstrated, at the time of Final Development
Plan Approval, a commitment to a Transportation Demand Management program
consistent with the reduced parking mandated in this Section 13.70. The measures to
be taken in this program must address:
(1) The amount of parking provided,
(2) The scale of development and the mix of uses proposed, and
(3) The assumptions employed with regard to the proportion of automobile use
for those traveling to the site.
For examples of such Measures, the Planning Board shall refer to the Eastern
Cambridge Plan, Article 18.000, and the requirements of Section 19.20 in establishing
Transportation Demand Management measures applicable to any approved PUD.
13-43
13.78.4 Relationship to MBTA Urban Ring Transportation Planning Project. In all PUD
application documents, the applicant shall indicate how the proposed PUD
development relates physically to the most current plans developed by the MBTA for
implementation of the Urban Ring transportation project.
13.79 Development Flexibility: Additional Permitted FAR and Height
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 13.70, the Planning Board may
accept a (preliminary) Development Proposal and may approve a Final Development
Plan that exceeds (1) the FAR limits otherwise required and (2) the proportion of nonresidential
GFA otherwise required subject to the following limitations and conditions:
13.79.1 Previously Issued Planned Unit Development Special Permits
The mix of uses, Gross Floor Area, and other dimensional characteristics of any existing
construction authorized by the grant of a PUD Special Permit, issued before the adoption
of this amended Section 13.70, shall be permitted by this Section 13.70. Such mix of
uses, GFA, and dimensional characteristics may be reauthorized by any subsequent
PUD Special Permit issued for the same Development Parcel under procedures
established in this Section 13.70.
13.79.2 Additional Gross Floor Area for Above Ground Structured Parking
The Planning Board may permit additional Gross Floor Area for the exclusive use of
structured accessory parking located above grade subject to the following limitations. It
is the intent of this Section 13.79.2 to permit the use of above ground parking structures
as an acoustical, visual and aesthetic barrier between occupied space (particularly
housing within the district and beyond the district in the existing East Cambridge
neighborhood) and the active rail lines, yards and operations therein, and adjacent bridge
structures abutting the North Point Residence District. In permitting such above ground
structured parking, it is expected that the authorized structures will be architecturally and
visually well integrated with the development as a whole and not in themselves
negatively impact the quality of the development.
(1) The parking facility shall be located adjacent to the Somerville municipal
boundary line, the Boston municipal boundary line or Charlestown Avenue (the
Gilmore Bridge), but in no case may it extend further than one hundred and
ninety-five (195) feet from the lot line between (A) either property used for active
rail use as of January 1, 2012 or Charlestown Avenue (the Gilmore Bridge) and
(B) property proposed to be developed within the Development Parcel for other
uses or on other land proposed to be developed in conjunction with any
development authorized by this Section 13.70. It is understood that such lot line
and land may be in part located in another municipality.
(2) The facility shall have a height no greater than twenty-five (25) feet unless the
Planning Board specifically authorizes a greater height.
(3) The design of the garage shall be of a quality comparable to that of other,
non-parking structures in the PUD.
13-44
(4) The structure shall be screened with active uses to the maximum extent
possible, but at least where it is likely to be viewed from the principal pedestrian
pathways within the PUD.
(5) The applicant shall provide to the Planning Board a study prepared by an
acoustical engineer outlining the anticipated impact of the proposed development
plan on the abatement of sound transmission from the adjacent rail yards to
areas within the PUD area and in the residential East Cambridge neighborhood
south and west of Msgr. OBrien Highway.
13-45
13.79.3 Additional Gross Floor Area for Non-residential Uses
The Planning Board may permit additional Gross Floor Area for permitted non-residential
uses subject to the following limitations:
(1) The additional non-residential GFA authorized shall not exceed that resulting
from the application of an FAR of 0.26 and it shall be in addition to and not a
substitute for the residential uses required in Section 13.74.1. In no case,
however, shall the total authorized GFA for the approved PUD exceed an FAR of
2.66. The provisions of Section 13.74.11 (Additional FAR for Proximity to
Transit) may continue to apply but in no case may the FAR permitted in that
section exceed 3.0.
(2) No additional parking shall be provided for this additional authorized nonresidential
GFA. The parking supply upon which that determination is made shall
be that supply permitted by the Planning Board for the development and mix of
uses permitted in Section 13.74.1.
(3) The applicant shall demonstrate through the Project Review Special Permit
process, Section 19.20, that the project with the additional non residential GFA
shall not create a more adverse impact upon traffic than the quantity and mix of
development permitted in Section 13.74.1. It is anticipated that such a standard
shall be met through limitations as to the uses permitted in the additional GFA
and through the provision of permanent transit enhancement improvements
above those required to be provided to gain approval of the GFA and use mix
permitted in Section 13.74.1. In no case, however, shall the additional nonresidential
FAR permitted in this Section 13.79 be granted by the Planning Board
unless the relocation of the MBTA Green Line Station at Lechmere is a part of
the PUD application and the Planning Board is satisfied that its construction at a
new North Point location will occur prior to the occupancy of any element of the
project utilizing the additional non-residential GFA.
(4) To be assured that the transportation related behavior of residents and
commercial tenants predicted to occur in the Traffic Study to be conducted under
Section 19.20 is borne out in fact as structures are occupied, the Planning Board
may require monitoring of actual traffic generation by those residents and
employees actually occupying the site. In its decision the Planning Board may
establish criteria and procedures for the timing of such subsequent monitoring of
traffic generation, including but not limited to the proportion of total development
that is occupied, the length of time such buildings have been fully occupied, and
the mix of uses in place.
13.79.4 Provision of Public Benefits
In reviewing any application for additional Gross Floor Area as authorized in Sections
13.79.2 and 13.79.3 above, the Planning Board may consider demonstrated efforts on
the part of the applicant to provide permanently affordable housing for middle income
households having an income at or below one hundred and twenty (120) percent of the
median income for households in the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, in
13-46
addition to those affordable units otherwise required in Section 11.200 and (2) to facilitate
the provision of a public sports facility.
13.710 Monitoring of Compliance with PUD Conditions
The Planning Board shall establish in its Decisions the details for monitoring of the
project and its performance, as it is implemented phase by phase. In anticipation of such
conditions, the applicant shall provide in the application a proposed plan for such longterm
monitoring and review.
13.80 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 5 DISTRICT.
13.81 Purpose. The PUD-5 District is intended to provide for Kendall Squares continued
prominence as a world-renowned center of innovation and a vibrant neighborhood
through the creation of a mixed-use district of high quality general and technical office
and laboratory uses with significant retail activity proximate to the MBTA station. The
PUD-5 District helps organize placement of commercial and institutional buildings and
establishes an additional mixed-use development containing a significant residential
component to support the burgeoning residential corridor along Third Street and the
strong links to existing neighborhoods and the riverfront. The PUD-5 District allows for
continued support of the academic mission at MIT and encourages connective links,
physical and otherwise, between the Institute and adjacent neighborhoods.
The PUD-5 District responds to the Kendall Square planning process and is intended to
be a smart-growth, transit-oriented district and therefore allows for replacing surface
parking lots with larger scale development in Kendall Square and the major public transit
services located there. The PUD-5 District encourages low parking ratios, shared
parking strategies, the use of public transportation and improved pedestrian and bicycle
environments. The PUD-5 District furthers the Citys goals for sustainable development
through buildings and sites that are planned, designed and constructed in a sustainable
way so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts as they are initially constructed
and as they are occupied and operated over the course of their useful lives.
The PUD-5 District promotes the creation of a strong retail corridor along Main Street and
the enhancement of Broad Canal Way. Combined, this new public crossroads will have
broad appeal as a desirable destination during and beyond the traditional workday by
providing a critical mass of diverse restaurants, shops, entertainment and programming.
The ground floor space will engage pedestrians and provide a variety of indoor and
outdoor gathering spaces, including retail that can address the needs and reflect the
creativity of the local community.
13.81.1 Establishment and Scope of Subdistricts within the PUD-5 District.
The PUD-5 District shall be divided into a series of Subdistricts as described below for
the purpose of defining requirements that may not apply to the District as a whole. All
provisions of the PUD-5 shall apply equally to each Subdistrict, except as provided for
elsewhere in Section 13.80.

Street running northerly from the intersection with Amherst Street to a line 400 feet
to the south and parallel to the Main Street front lot lines of properties abutting Main
Street and located between Ames and Hayward Streets, then westerly by said line
to the centerline of Hayward Street, then the centerline of Hayward Street running
south toward Amherst Street and then the centerline of Amherst Street running west
to Ames Street.
13.81.2.4 The Memorial Drive Height Subdistrict is the area bounded by the centerline of
Ames Street running northerly from the northern sideline of Memorial Drive, then the
centerline of Amherst Street running east toward Wadsworth Street, then the
centerline of Wadsworth Street running south to its intersection with a line 150 feet
north of and parallel to the lot lines of the parcels abutting the northerly boundary of
Memorial Drive, then easterly along said line to the easterly boundary of Lot #15 on
Assessors Map 46, then southerly along said easterly boundary to the northern
edge of the DCR right of way along Memorial Drive, then westerly by the northern
sideline of Memorial Drive.

upon written determination by the Planning Board that such use is consistent with the
objectives of the PUD-5 District and is consistent with the predominant uses in the PUD-5
District.
13.83 Floor Area Ratio; Gross Floor Area.
13.83.1 Maximum Floor Area Ratio. The maximum total Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of the PUD-5
District shall be 3.9 for all permitted uses. The FAR of any given Development Parcel
may exceed the limitation set forth above as long as the overall FAR in the PUD-5 District
for such uses does not at any time exceed the limitation set forth above.
13.83.2 Floor Area Ratio and Gross Floor Area Exemptions. Notwithstanding anything appearing
in this Section 13.83 or otherwise contained in the Zoning Ordinance to the contrary, the
following shall not be counted as Gross Floor Area for the purposes of calculating the
allowable FAR for the PUD-5 District or the Gross Floor Area limitations set forth further
below:
a. The Gross Floor Area of any first floor or areas situated no more than one (1) floor
below grade of a building devoted to the retail uses identified in Sections 13.82.5 and
13.82.6, constructed or, if located in an existing building, substantially renovated, after
13-49
the adoption of Section 13.80, provided, however, that in the event that the average
size of individual retail uses located in the PUD-5 District exceed 5,000 square of
Gross Floor Area, the portion of any individual retail use exceeding 5,000 square feet
(or 10,000 square feet for a grocery, market or pharmacy retail use) shall be counted
as Gross Floor Area for the purposes of calculating allowable FAR. The floor area of
any grocery, market or pharmacy uses shall not be included in calculating the average
size of individual retail uses for the purposes of this Section 13.82.3.a.
b. The area of any public transportation facility directly providing public transportation
services that is owned or controlled by a public transportation agency.
c. The Gross Floor Area of any residential and institutional dormitory uses constructed in
any of the Main Street, Transitional Height and Memorial Drive Height Subdistricts
after January 1, 2013, but only to the extent that such Gross Floor Area, when taken
together with the aggregate Gross Floor Area of all other residential and institutional
dormitory uses then-situated within said Subdistricts, exceeds the total amount of
Gross Floor Area devoted to such uses within said Subdistricts as of January 1, 2013.
d. Fifty percent (50%) of the Gross Floor Area devoted to Innovation Office Space (as
defined in Section 13.89.3), up to an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
total office space remaining in the PUD-5 District.
13.83.3 Gross Floor Area Limitations.
a. Definition of New Gross Floor Area. For purposes of this Section 13.80, New Gross
Floor Area shall mean an amount of square feet of Gross Floor Area in excess of the
amount of Gross Floor Area in existence in the PUD-5 District as of January 1, 2013.
For example, if an existing building in the PUD-5 District containing 50,000 square
feet of Gross Floor Area is demolished and a building containing 55,000 square feet
of Gross Floor Area is constructed in its place, 5,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area
would be considered New Gross Floor Area.
b. Plan Requirements.
i. Existing Uses. As part of the first application for a PUD special permit under the
provisions of this Section 13.80, such existing Gross Floor Area for the entire
PUD-5 District shall be identified as to quantity, type of use and location and
such enumeration shall thereafter serve as the basis from which to administer
this Section 13.83.3.
ii. Conceptual Development Plan. A Development Proposal shall include, in
addition to the required site plans for development within that particular
Development Parcel, a conceptual plan depicting the range of potential building
sites elsewhere in the PUD-5 District and indicating the potential size and use (or
alternate uses) of future development on those sites. The purpose of this plan is
to place the Development Proposal in context with existing and potential future
13-50
development and to illustrate how the remaining allowed development within the
District may be distributed in the future. The conceptual development plan shall
be expected to evolve over time. With each subsequent Development Proposal
within the PUD-5 District, a revised conceptual plan shall be submitted.
Revisions to a conceptual plan shall not require amending any previously
approved PUD Special Permit, but shall not be effective to waive or modify any of
the specific conditions contained in a previously approved PUD Special Permit.
The Conceptual Development Plan may also incorporate the Conceptual Open
Space Plan required in Section 13.87.2.
c. Commercial Limitation. No more than an aggregate of 980,000 square feet of New
Gross Floor Area of the types of uses listed in Sections 13.82.4-13.82.7 shall be
permitted in the PUD-5 District.
Notwithstanding anything in this Ordinance to the contrary, a building shall not be
considered to be a commercial building if institutional uses occupy in excess of
seventy-five percent (75%) of the Gross Floor Area of the building, excluding the Gross
Floor Area of any retail contained therein, for the purposes of Sections 13.88 and
13.89.4.
13.84 Parcel and Lot Requirements.
13.84.1 Parcel and Lot Size. The minimum size for a Development Parcel for a PUD in the PUD5
District shall be 25,000 square feet. There shall be no minimum lot size for lots within a
Development Parcel in the PUD-5 District.
13.84.2 Lot Width. There shall be no minimum width for a Development Parcel and no minimum
width for lots located within a Development Parcel.
13.84.2 Minimum Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit. There shall be no required minimum Lot Area per
dwelling unit in the PUD-5 District.
13.85 Setbacks. Except as provided below, there shall be no minimum required front, rear and
side yard requirements for a Development Parcel or for lots located within a Development
Parcel.
13.85.1 New commercial buildings along Main Street, Third Street and Broadway containing uses
set forth in Sections 13.82.4 -13.82.7 above in the PUD-5 District must be set back
sixteen (16) feet from the Street Line of Main Street, Third Street and Broadway at and
above a point eighty-five (85) feet above mean grade. Up to one-third of the façade
length on such a street, on a cumulative basis, may be exempt from this requirement.
13.85.2 New buildings constructed in the Third Street Transition Sub-District must be set back
from the portion the easterly boundary of the Sub-District situated within 120 feet of the
northerly Street Line of Main Street (the Limited Setback Boundary) (a) a distance of at
13-51
least twenty (20) feet, running parallel from the Limited Setback Boundary, and (b) thirtysix
(36) feet for any portions of the building that exceed a height of eighty-five (85) feet
above mean grade, running parallel from the Limited Setback Boundary.
13.86 Height.

any building shall be 250 feet, except as permitted by Section 13.86.1.1.
13.86.1.1 The Planning Board may approve Final Development Plans that result in no more than
one new building exceeding 250 feet up to 300 feet in height in the Third Street
Transition Subdistrict and one additional building up to 300 feet in height in the Main
Street Subdistrict; provided that:
a. the use of any occupiable space situated above 250 feet in height shall be limited to
residential and/or institutional dormitory uses, and
b. within a residential building, Middle Income Units (as defined below) shall occupy an
aggregate Gross Floor Area equal to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total
residential Gross Floor Area (excluding any Gross Floor Area occupied by institutional
dormitory uses) in the portions of the building that exceed 250 feet in height. Such
Middle Income Units shall be evenly distributed throughout the residential building in a
manner approved by the Planning Board, in consultation with City staff, in the Final
Development Plan for a Development Parcel, in order to ensure that the Middle
Income Units are of an appropriate location, size, configuration and quality for
households intended to occupy such units.
For the purposes of this Section 13.86.1.1, Middle Income Units shall be defined as
residential dwelling units for which:
i. the occupancy is restricted to households whose total income exceeds 80% but
does not exceed 120% of the median income of households in the Boston
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area adjusted for family size, or such other
equivalent income standard as may be determined by the Board of Trustees of
the Affordable Housing Trust Fund; and
ii. the rent (including utilities) does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the income of
the renting household or, in the instance of home ownership units, the monthly
mortgage payment (including insurance, utilities and real estate taxes) does not
exceed thirty percent (30%) of the income of the purchasing household, or such
other equivalent standard as may be determined by the Board of Trustees of the
Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
13.86.2 In the Transitional Height Subdistrict, the maximum height of any building shall be 200
feet. Notwithstanding the above, if at least 50% of the area of the ground floor footprint
of a building is located within the Main Street Subdistrict, a portion of the building at the
13-52
higher height may extend into the Transition Height Subdistrict, but by no more than 50
feet.
13.86.3 In the Memorial Drive Height Subdistrict, the maximum height of any building shall be
150 feet.
13.87 Open Space.
13.87.1 Minimum Open Space. The minimum overall percentage of Publicly Beneficial Open
Space of the total area of the PUD-5 District shall be fifteen percent (15%). The
percentage of Publicly Beneficial Open Space provided in any given Final Development
Plan for a Development Parcel may be less than 15% as long as the overall ratio in the
PUD-5 District is not less than 15%. In the event that a Development Parcel provides
less than 15% open space, the Final Development Plan for the Development Parcel shall
identify the Publicly Beneficial Open Space in the PUD-5 District that shall equal or
exceed 15% of the total area of the PUD-5 District.
13.87.2 Conceptual Open Space Plan. A Development Proposal shall include a conceptual plan
depicting the size, layout and configuration of Publicly Beneficial Open Space within the
PUD-5 District upon completion of the proposed building(s) in the Development Parcel.
This conceptual plan shall indicate the Publicly Beneficial Open Space that exists in the
PUD-5 District as of the time of the submission of the Development Proposal, that will be
constructed as part of the Development Proposal, and that are planned for elsewhere in
the PUD-5 District. The conceptual open space plan shall be expected to evolve over
time as some portions of Publicly Beneficial Open Space may be relocated or
reconfigured as part of future Development Proposals. With each subsequent
Development Proposal within the PUD-5 District, a revised conceptual open space plan
shall be submitted. Revisions to a conceptual open space plan shall not require
amending any previously approved PUD Special Permit, but shall not be effective to
waive or modify any of the specific conditions contained in a previously approved PUD
Special Permit. The Conceptual Open Space Plan may be presented jointly with the
Conceptual Development Plan required in Section 13.83(b)(ii).
13.88 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-5 District shall conform to
the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as
modified by this Section 13.88.
13.88.1 With regard to uses contained within new commercial buildings, provided that the
requirements of Section 6.23 of the Ordinance are met, the parking requirements of this
Section 13.88 may be satisfied (a) anywhere in the PUD-5 District or, if located outside of
the PUD-5 District, within 2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Article 6.000 and (b) in total or in part by a lease agreement
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or consortium for
use of parking spaces in the public or pooled private parking facilities within said area.
13-53
13.88.2 All parking provided within an approved PUD shall be considered collectively accessory
to all approved uses within the PUD, including any uses outside of the Development
Parcel that may be approved by the Planning Board. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Article 6.000, this Ordinance shall not restrict the management and
assignment of parking spaces in a way that will most efficiently utilize the existing and
proposed parking spaces to serve all approved uses. As an exception to this rule, all
parking spaces (whether existing or proposed) to be included within an institutional
parking pool shall be distinctly identified, and shall not be used for any other uses except
in ways that are explicitly approved by the Planning Board in issuing a PUD Special
Permit Decision.
13.88.3 Minimum Parking. In approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel, the
Planning Board may waive any minimum parking requirements applicable in the zoning
district, with the exception that parking for residential uses shall not be less than 0.5
parking spaces per dwelling unit. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for
shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces. The Planning
Board shall specify a minimum parking requirement for a PUD based on review and
analysis of Transportation Impact Studies and other relevant information on parking
demand provided in application documents, including the Shared Parking Study as
required further below, and with the guidance of City agencies.
13.88.4 Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a PUD shall be limited by applying the
rates set forth below to each use within the PUD and taking the summation of the result
for all uses. Exceeding the maximum allowed parking shall require a waiver of maximum
parking required under the general provisions of Article 6.000.
a. Maximum of 0.9 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for office
uses, excluding technical office (Section 4.34(a-e)).
b. Maximum of 0.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for laboratory
use and technical office uses (Section 4.34(f)).
c. Maximum of 0.75 spaces per residential dwelling unit (Section 4.31(d-g)).
d. Maximum of 0.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail (Sections 4.35 and 4.36).
e. Maximum of 1 space per 4 sleeping rooms for hotel use (Section 4.31(i)(2)).
13.88.5 Shared Parking Study. A Development Proposal for development in the PUD-5 District
shall include an analysis of anticipated parking demand for all uses in the development
throughout the course of a typical day and week. This analysis may identify opportunities
for reducing the total amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of
parking spaces by multiple uses. Based on this analysis, the Planning Board may
approve a reduced minimum or maximum parking requirement upon finding that the
approved amount of parking will be sufficient to serve all permitted uses.
13.88.6 Design, Dimensional, and Other Requirements of Provided Parking and Loading
Facilities
13-54
a. Except as provided herein, all parking for new non-residential and noninstitutional
uses shall be underground structured parking. Notwithstanding this
underground parking requirement, parking for all uses in the Third Street
Transition Subdistrict may be in above-ground structured parking provided such
structured parking is consistent with the existing structured parking in the
Subdistrict.
b. In its approval of a Final Development Plan, the Planning Board, in consultation
with City staff (including the Traffic Parking and Transportation Department), may
approve (i) the location, layout and design of parking spaces that deviate from
the requirements of Article 6.000; (ii) the location, width and layout of curb cuts
serving the Development Parcel that deviate from the requirements of Section
6.43; and (iii) a small number of on-grade parking and loading spaces to be used
for, among other things, handicap parking, short-term loading, use by food trucks
and other short-term or special purposes.
13.88.7 Temporary On-Grade Open Parking for Commercial Uses
On an interim basis in anticipation of later construction of underground or other
structured parking sufficient to meet all parking requirements of a new commercial use
constructed on a Development Parcel, on-grade open parking shall be allowed within the
PUD-5 District to serve such a use subject to the following conditions:
a. The future underground parking structure will be constructed within the PUD-5
District, but it may be located either on or off of the lot which it will serve;
b. Construction of the replacement subsurface parking structure is anticipated to
commence within four (4) years of the date of certificate of occupancy for the
building initially served by on grade parking;
c. The future subsurface parking structure will contain sufficient spaces for users of
the building initially served by on grade open parking so as to meet the parking
requirements for such building; and
d. Binding commitments shall exist to establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Planning Board, that requirements (a) through (c) above shall be satisfied. Such
commitments shall be made by negotiated lease agreement, deed restriction,
covenant, or comparable legal instrument.
13.88.8 Pre-Existing Parking Spaces
a. The Planning Board, after consultation with City staff, may approve in a Final
Development Plan, underground or structured parking spaces as replacements
for pre-existing accessory parking spaces that will be displaced by improvements
contemplated by such Final Development Plan, provided that such spaces are
serving pre-existing commercial uses that are not proposed to be substantially
altered. The Planning Board shall approve such replacement spaces upon
determining that they were legally permitted under the applicable zoning
regulations when the pre-existing use was established and that the traffic
generated by the pre-existing use shall not be increased as a result. If such preexisting
spaces have been guaranteed to a third party by virtue of the terms of a
13-55
duly executed lease, license or other legally binding written agreement that exists
as of January 1, 2013, the Planning Board may include conditions to its approval
that would take effect upon the expiration of the third partys pre-existing use and
occupancy of building, pursuant to the existing agreement (as such agreement
may be extended and/or renewed from time to time).
b. Where any pre-existing accessory off-street parking spaces located in a
Development Parcel that are serving a pre-existing use located outside the
Development Parcel (whether within or outside the PUD-5 District) are proposed
to be eliminated or displaced in accordance with the Final Development Plan for
that Development Parcel, such pre-existing off-street parking may be relocated to
a Parcel other than the Development Parcel by Special Permit granted by the
Planning Board to the owner of the off-site use after consultation with City staff,
provided, however, that such use is permitted on such other Parcel either as-ofright
or by virtue of zoning relief granted for such Parcel by the Planning Board or
the Board of Zoning Appeals, as the case may be. In granting such Special
Permit, the Planning Board may grant deviations from the requirements of Article
6.000 of this Ordinance for the number, location, layout and design of the
relocated parking spaces.
c. Such replacement or relocated accessory parking spaces for pre-existing uses
shall not count toward the maximum parking permitted under this Section 13.88.
13.88.9 The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan for a Development
Parcel, may waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading
facilities within a Development Parcel, and may permit loading facilities to be shared
across various uses and lots within the PUD-5 District.
13.88.10 The quantity, design and location of bicycle parking shall comply with the provisions set
forth in Article 6.000 of this Ordinance.
13.89 Special Requirements, Conditions and Standards Applicable to Certain Development
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-5 District. The Planning Board shall
approve a Final Development Plan only after finding that in addition to all other applicable
requirements the following requirements have been met. The Planning Board shall, in
addition, include conditions in the approval of a Final Development Plan that will ensure
ongoing compliance with these requirements.
13.89.1 Rooftop Mechanical Equipment Noise Mitigation. Sound emanating from rooftop
mechanical equipment on all new or substantially altered structures (i.e., alterations to an
existing structure or building the cost of which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
assessed value of such building or structure) in an approved Final Development Plan
shall be minimized by the adoption of best available and feasible practices regarding the
location and sizing of equipment, the selection of equipment and sound attenuation
measures.
At a minimum, any noise or vibration emanating from new commercial or substantially
altered (as defined in this Section 13.89.1) commercial buildings shall not be normally
perceptible at ground level without instruments at a distance of one hundred (100) feet
13-56
from the source lot line and shall comply with the provisions of the City of Cambridge
Noise Ordinance applicable to Commercial Areas (as such term is defined in the Noise
Ordinance).
In order to enforce these requirements, the applicant shall provide, in addition to Noise
Mitigation narrative required as part of Article 19.000 review, acoustical reports prepared
by a professional acoustical engineer as described below:
a. Prior to and as a condition of the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for
a new or substantially altered commercial building, an acoustical report, including
field measurements, demonstrating compliance of such building with all
applicable noise requirements; and
b. Prior to obtaining any building permit to add any equipment having a capacity
greater than five (5) horsepower to the rooftop, a narrative report demonstrating
that there will be continued compliance with all applicable noise requirements
after such addition, and upon completion of such addition and as a condition to
operation thereof, an acoustical report, including field measurements,
demonstrating such compliance.
13.89.2 Required Housing.
At least 240,000 square feet of New Gross Floor Area in the aggregate must be devoted
to residential uses in the PUD-5 District. Prior to the issuance of a building permit
allowing construction of New Gross Floor Area for commercial uses in excess of 600,000
square feet in the aggregate, the Developer must demonstrate that construction of a
minimum of 240,000 square feet of New Gross Floor Area of residential use has
commenced, a full building permit has been issued for the construction of such
residential use and that the construction of such square footage is being continuously
and diligently pursued. The required residential Gross Floor Area shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 11.200 of the Zoning Ordinance. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, a Final Development Plan shall be subject to the requirements of Section
11.203.1 (Requirements for Incentive Zoning Contributions) and 11.203.2 of the Zoning
Ordinance (Requirements for Inclusionary Housing), provided, however, in the Third
Street Transition Subdistrict, subject to the provisions of Section 11.203, the percentage
shall be increased to eighteen percent (18%).
13.89.3 Innovation Space. A Development Proposal containing at least 200,000 square feet of
new Office Uses shall include a plan for Innovation Office Space meeting the
requirements of this Section 13.89.3.
13.89.3.1 Required Space. For a Development Proposal containing new Office Uses,
Innovation Office Space within the PUD-5 District must occupy Gross Floor Area equal
to, or in excess of, the amount of Gross Floor Area that is five percent (5%) of the New
Gross Floor Area approved in the Final Development Plan for Office Uses. Existing
Gross Floor Area within the PUD-5 District may be used to meet this requirement.
Where at least 40,000 square feet of Innovation Office Space is required, Innovation
Office Space may be distributed in separate buildings, provided, however, that each
13-57
separate unit of Innovation Office Space, contains at least 20,000 square feet. If less
than 40,000 square feet of Innovation Office Space is required to be contained in the
PUD-5 District, the Innovation Office Space must be contained in a single building.
Developers of properties within the PUD-5 District may collaborate with property owners
in adjacent zoning districts in the Kendall Square area to develop joint Innovation Office
Space Plan. In such a case, the total square footage of joint Innovation Office Space
must be large enough to satisfy the sum of the requirements, if any, for such participating
developers and zoning districts.
13.89.3.2 Characteristics. For the purposes of this Section 13.89.3, the required Innovation
Office Space shall have the following characteristics:
a. Durations of lease agreements (or other similar occupancy agreements) with
individual business entities shall be for periods of approximately one (1) month.
b. No single business entity may occupy more than 2,000 square feet or 10% of the
entire Innovation Office Space required to be provided in the PUD-5 District,
whichever is greater.
c. The average size of separately contracted private suites may not exceed 200
square feet of GFA.
d. Innovation Office Space shall include shared resources (i.e., co-working areas,
conference space, office equipment, supplies and kitchens) available to all
tenants and must occupy at least 50% of the Innovation Office Space.
e. Individual entities occupying Innovation Office Space may include small business
incubators, small research laboratories, office space for investors and
entrepreneurs, facilities for teaching and for theoretical, basic and applied
research, product development and testing and prototype fabrication or
production of experimental products.
13.89.3.3 Variations. In approving a Final Development Plan or a Minor Amendment to a Final
Development Plan, the Planning Board may allow variations in the specific standards and
characteristics set forth Sections 13.89.3.1 and 13.89.3.2 above, if the Planning Board
finds that the Innovation Office Space, as proposed, will be consistent with the purposes
of these standards and characteristics.
13.89.4 Sustainability.
New buildings constructed within the PUD-5 District shall comply with the provisions of
Section 22.20 of the Ordinance. Notwithstanding the above, new commercial buildings
containing uses identified in Sections 13.82.4 and 13.82.7 and new residential buildings
identified in Section 13.82.1, shall comply with LEED Gold level criteria. In connection
with the submission requirements of Section 22.24.2.a., the developer of such buildings
shall submit a Statement of Energy Design Intent produced through the EnergyStar
Target Finder tool, or comparable method. New institutional buildings will meet LEED
Gold level criteria, unless the technological specifications of a proposed specialized
research facility are such that the developer can demonstrate the impracticability of
achieving the LEED Gold level criteria or the inordinate impact achieving the LEED Gold
level would have on such specialized research facility. New buildings in the PUD-5
13-58
District must incorporate an integrated design approach and incorporate the best
practices for meeting sustainability in the following five (5) areas:
a. Energy and Emissions; Steam. Each new building must conserve building
energy and, to the extent applicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The
Developer, with each Development within the PUD-5 District, must evaluate the
potential for on-site energy generation or the construction of co-generation
facilities within the PUD-5 District that will serve the new building and other
buildings located within the PUD-5 District. A Development Proposal for a
commercial building shall include a study, prepared by the Developer,
considering the feasibility of connecting the building identified in the
Development Proposal to the existing district steam system.
b. Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The Developer, for each new
building, must explore opportunities for (i) potable water use reductions, (ii) storm
water management using open spaces, (iii) the incorporation of indigenous
vegetation and (iv) storm water for irrigation purposes. At a minimum, all new
buildings within the PUD-5 District must meet the Department of Public Works
standards for water quality management and the retention/detention of the
difference between the 2-year 24-hour pre-construction runoff hydrograph and
the post-construction 25-year 24-hour runoff hydrograph.
c. Healthy Living & Working. Each new building must provide people with access
to daylight and enhance the visual and thermal comfort of people living and
working within the PUD-5 District.
d. Transportation. The Final Development Plan for the PUD-5 District must
encourage multimodal transportation, provide facilities for cyclists and provide an
infrastructure to support alternative energy vehicles.
e. Promotion of Sustainability Awareness. New buildings within the PUD-5 must be
designed to incorporate features that demonstrate other sustainability strategies.
f. Cool Roofs. All new buildings approved in the District after January 1, 2013,
must employ Functional Green Roofs (as such term is defined in Article 22.000
of this Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo white roofs or a functionally equivalent
roofing system.
g. Monitoring. All new buildings approved in the PUD-5 District after January 1,
2013, shall track and report energy use to the City using EnergyStar, Labs21,
LEED-EBOM or a substantially similar mechanism. Such reporting shall occur at
the end of the first year of occupancy of the building, then once annually during
the first five (5) years of occupancy, and once every five (5) years thereafter.
Failure to provide such reports to the City shall not constitute a failure of
condition of any PUD-5 Special Permit.
h. In connection with the approval of a Final Development Plan or in connection
with the granting of a Special Permit pursuant to Article 19 of the Ordinance, the
Planning Board may grant dimensional and other zoning relief in order to permit
the construction of a co-generation facility or other energy systems that allow
developments to develop shared solutions to minimize energy usage.
13.810 Other Provisions.
13-59
13.810.1 Active Uses and Pedestrian Activity.
Final Development Plans for commercial uses shall enhance the public pedestrian usage
of the sidewalks and create a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an
interesting, lively and active presence at street level. Accordingly, portions of the first
floors of commercial buildings in locations enumerated below shall generally be planned,
designed, constructed and used for Active Uses (defined below). At a minimum, a total
of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate New Gross Floor Area of the
Activation Space situated within a commercial building in the PUD-5 District shall be
devoted to Active Uses. For the purposes of this Section 13.810.1, the term Activation
Space shall mean the portions of the first floors of commercial buildings immediately
abutting Main Street, Broadway and the Broad Canal, situated between the Principal
Front Wall Plane of such building along said Main Street and Broadway and along the
northerly and easterly boundaries of the Third Street Transition Subdistrict along Broad
Canal Way and the line that is situated twenty (20) feet from said Principal Front Wall
Plane. Notwithstanding the above, the Planning Board, in approving a Final
Development Plan for a new building, may, in consultation with City staff, grant a
reduction of the required minimum total area of Active Uses within the Activation Space
of the new building, where such reduction is necessitated by site conditions or other
complications.
Definition of Active Uses. For purposes of this Section 13.810.1, Active Uses means:
(1) Retail business and consumer service establishments listed in Section
4.35;
(2) Institutional uses that are generally open to the public, such as museums
and exhibition spaces;
(3) Uses listed in Section 13.82.6; and
(4) Other uses which the Planning Board determines meet the goals of this
Section 13.810.1.
The definition of Active Uses shall specifically exclude lobbies or other spaces that
serve an accessory function to upper-story office or laboratory uses.
Building and Site Design Requirements for Active Uses and Open Spaces.
(1) Active Uses shall have one or more entrance(s) from the sidewalk or
plaza separate from the principal entrance of the building for non-retail
uses.
(2) Outdoor courtyards, delineated gathering space, or sitting areas are
encouraged throughout each Development Parcel in any approved Final
Development Plan.
Prior to submitting any application for a special permit in the PUD-5 District, the applicant
shall engage the services of a consultant or other party with retail expertise to advise the
applicant in connection with retail and other Active Uses to be included in the applicable
Development Parcel. The recommendations of that consultant shall be included in the
applicable special permit application.
13-60
13.810.2 Contribution to Community Fund.
Upon the Planning Boards approval of the first Final Development Plan for a
Development Parcel within the PUD-5 District, the permittee shall contribute to a
Community Fund, established by the City Manager, an amount equal to $10.00 multiplied
by the number of square feet of new gross floor area for the commercial uses identified in
section 13.82.4 and 13.82.7 (an amount, a Fund Contribution Payment). The City shall
use the funds contributed by the developer pursuant to this Section 13.810.2.
Notwithstanding the above, the permittee shall, within ninety (90) days of the adoption of
this Section 13.80, make a payment of $2,500,000 to the City as a deposit against future
Fund Contribution Payments. On the earlier to occur of the issuance of the first Final
Certificate of Occupancy for a new commercial building within the PUD-5 District or three
(3) years from the date of the adoption of Article 13.80, the permittee shall make a
payment of $2,500,000 to the City as an additional deposit against future Fund
Contribution Payments. Following the payment of the second deposit the permittee shall
not be required to make any further Fund Contribution Payments until such time as the
City has issued Final Certificates of Occupancy for new commercial buildings containing
500,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area, in the aggregate.
13.810.3 Planning and Zoning Studies; Design Guidelines. In its review and approval of a Final
Development Plan for a Development Parcel, the Planning Board shall consider all future
planning and zoning studies and design guidelines adopted by the Planning Board for a
geographic area containing the Development Parcel.
13.810.4 Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated April 8, 2013, by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology shall be binding upon the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and its successors and assigns. The issuance of any building permit or
certificate of occupancy authorized by a Planned Unit Development Special Permit
issued pursuant to this Section 13.80 shall be conditioned upon certification by the
Community Development Department and all other relevant City departments to the
Inspectional Services Department that all portions of the aforementioned Letter of
Commitment are continuing to be met.

located within the District; to provide for mixed income residential uses as an extension
of the existing Cambridgeport residential neighborhood.
15.13 Approach. This Article is designed to fulfill the above purpose of the Cambridgeport
Revitalization Development District by establishing controls which will facilitate
development while protecting the public interest; by setting regulations which limit the
aggregate amount of development within the District by setting other district wide
requirements while permitting flexible development scale and configuration on
individual lots within the District; by requiring a minimum of residential development
and encouraging additional residential development within the District and by allowing
mixed uses within the District.

existing on the site at the time of conversion, if any. However, if the land area
required for provided parking outside the building, including required setbacks is
less than the area of land that has no structure on it, the remainder of the open
land shall have any paving material (asphalt, concrete, or gravel) removed,
topsoil of a minimum two foot depth shall be added, and the space shall be
landscaped with trees, shrubs, and/or grass up to the maximum percentage of
the lot required to be Private open space in the Ordinance.
3) The maximum building height shall be forty (40) feet with a cornice height not to

regulated wetlands where they occur within the district; maintaining flood storage capacity
in the district consistent with federal regulations; minimizing the amount of additional
traffic passing through congested intersections on arterial streets, and on local,
neighborhood streets, that could provide access to the district; limiting stormwater runoff
onto property located outside the district ensuring adequate visual buffers and screening
of buildings and parking facilities from adjacent public parks and recreation facilities;
minimizing the disturbance of existing soil within the district to limit dispersal and
exposure to possible harmful residual substances in the soil; and in enhancing the
parkway character of the Parkway Overlay District.

17.33.11 Total Development Permitted. The total Gross Floor Area (GFA) permitted in Special
District 3 shall be seven hundred, eighty two thousand and five hundred (782,500)
square feet, exclusive of Gross Floor Area occupied by the MBTA Red Line transit
station and any structure in existence at the time of adoption of this Section 17.30 that
is used exclusively for residential use. Total Gross Floor Area in the District is at any
time the sum of the Gross Floor Area of all structures then located in the District
(excepting the above described structures and those other structures required to be
demolished prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any newly
constructed building in the district) and those which are being constructed or may be
constructed in the District pursuant to a then effective building permit. At no time may
a building permit be issued for any structure that would result in the above Gross Floor
Area limit for all structures in the District (excepting the above described structures and
those other structures required to be demolished prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for any newly constructed building in the District) being exceeded.
Development within the District shall be further regulated as set forth below.
17.33.12 Allocation of GFA to Lots in Existence as of the Date of Adoption of this Section 17.30.
In allocating the total permitted GFA within the district, each lot in existence as of the
date of adoption of this Section 17.30 shall be allocated a minimum gross floor area
equal to the allocation of a Floor Area Ratio of 0.45 to the lot area. No building permit
shall be issued for any lot that would require the reduction of GFA allocated to any
such existing lot below that which is allowed by the application of the FAR of 0.45
without the written consent by the owner of such existing lot. Future subdivision of any
existing lot shall be permitted, but in no event shall the amount of GFA permitted on
the original existing lot as set forth in this Section 17.33.12 be increased by such
subdivision. For the purposes of this Section 17.33.12, a lot may consist of parcels of
land held in separate ownership but developed as a single zoning lot.
17.33.13 Maximum Floor Area Ratio. There shall be no FAR limit with regard to the amount of
GFA on any single lot within the District, subject to the total development limits set forth
in Sections 17.33.11 and 17.33.12 above. Additional GFA above that permitted by the
application of an FAR of 0.45 to any lot, may be constructed on any lot to the extent
that the total amount of development (GFA) at the time within the entire Special District
3 is less than that permitted in Section 17.33.11 above.
17.33.2 Minimum Lot Area of Each Dwelling Unit. The minimum Lot Area per Dwelling
Unit shall be two thousand and five hundred (2,500) square feet.
17.33.3 Minimum Lot Size and Minimum Lot Width.

shall apply in the Special District 9.
17.95 Additional Use and Gross Floor Area Provisions for Existing Nonresidential Uses
and Structures.
(A) It is the intent of this Section 17.97 to encourage a gradual evolution of
nonresidential uses in this Special District 9 now heavily nonresidential in
character, from those least in harmony with the adjacent residential neighborhood
and the residential uses ultimately desired in the district, to those nonresidential
uses most compatible with residential uses and ultimately to residential uses
exclusively. Therefore, in the Special District 9 the following additional uses not
otherwise permitted in a Residence C District shall be permitted as of right,
provided the conditions set forth below are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 10.31, no variance for use shall be permitted in this Special District 9. For
the purposes of Article 8.000 this Special District 9 shall continue to be considered
a residential district and therefore Section 8.22, Paragraphs a and b shall not
apply.
(1) All uses in Section 4.34, Office and Laboratory Uses, shall be permitted but
only if the following conditions are met:
a. The building thereon, (or that portion of the building proposed to be
reused) is vacant and not occupied by a residential use in the five years
immediately preceding the time of application for a Certificate of
Occupancy for the proposed use, or if occupied, the current use is any
office and laboratory use, Section 4.34; any retail business and
consumer service establishment, Section 4.35; any light industry,
wholesale business or storage use, Section 4.37; or any heavy industry
use, Section 4.38.

Establishments, Paragraphs a, c and d shall be permitted, but only if the
following conditions are met:

a. The use existing at the time of application for a Certificate of
Occupancy for the proposed new use, or that first legally established
use immediately preceding the application for a proposed new use
should the premises be vacant (provided that the previous use was in
operation within the two years immediately preceding the application for
a Certificate of Occupancy), is any retail business and Consumer
Service Establishment, Section 4.35; or any light Industry, wholesale
business and storage use, Section 4.37; or any heavy industry use,
Section 4.38; and
b. The use shall occupy only that gross floor area meeting the use
limitations of Paragraph a above.
(3) All uses in Section 4.37, light industry, wholesale business, and storage,
Paragraphs a and b shall be permitted, but only if the following conditions are
met:
a. The use existing at the time of application for a Certificate of
Occupancy for the proposed use, or that first legally established use
immediately preceding the application for a Certificate of Occupancy
for a proposed new use should the premises be vacant (provided that
the previous use was in operation within the two years immediately
preceding the application for a Certificate of Occupancy), is light
industry, wholesale business or storage use, Section 4.37; or any
heavy industry use, Section 4.38; and
b. The use shall occupy only that gross floor area meeting the Use
Limitations of Paragraph a above.
(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, in any structure
containing a residential use which is less than fifty (50) percent of the total gross
floor area of the building within which it is located, that residential use may be
replaced by any one of the permitted uses in Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, which
use shall thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of this Section 17.97.
(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of (A) (1) - (3) above, in any structure containing a
use which is less than fifty (50) percent of the total gross floor area of the building
within which it is located, that use may be replaced by any one of the permitted
uses in Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, which use shall thereafter be subject to all
of the provisions of this Section 17.97.
(D) For structures satisfying the requirements of (B) above, in existence as of January
1, 1991 the maximum gross floor area on a lot devoted to nonresidential uses shall
be limited by an FAR of .9.
17.96 Nonconforming Structures
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.23, that portion of a legal, nonconforming
structure lying within this Special District 9 which is destroyed or damaged by fire,
explosion, or other catastrophe may be rebuilt or restored and used again, in the same
way as it had been legally used immediately before the damage, without limit as to cost
of such rebuilding or restoring provided the following conditions are met:
17-30
(a) Any restoration or rebuilding shall commence within twelve (12) months after the
catastrophe;
(b) The structure shall be restored or rebuilt to the same design, including materials
and design details as existed previously; or should the restoration not be feasible
necessitating that the structure be rebuilt to a different design, said design shall be
at least equal to the original design of the structure in quality of materials used, the
quantity and quality of design details employed, and the compatibility of the site
design with abutting properties;
(c) The Community Development Department shall certify to the Superintendent of
Buildings that the above conditions have been met.
With respect to the comparability of newly designed buildings, the Community
Development Department shall consult the Cambridge Historical Commission for
structures greater than fifty (50) years old. Should the Community Development
Department find that said conditions have not been met the restoring or rebuilding
shall require a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal.
The restored or rebuilt structure shall in no aspect increase the nonconforming
nature of the original structure; nothing in this Section 17.98, however, shall
prohibit a rebuilding or restoring which reduces the nonconforming nature of the
original structure.
17.97 Standards for Issuance of Special Permit. In addition to the general standards for the
issuance of a special permit found in Section 10.40 of the Zoning Ordinance, the
special permit granting authority shall in addition make the following findings:
1. The proposed development is consistent with the following goals and objectives:
- To encourage mixed use development compatible with the Cambridgeport
residential neighborhood with housing uses strongly encouraged along
Brookline Street and over to Sidney Street;
- To promote street and sidewalk improvements to create a unified image and
improve the physical and visual environment and tie the existing nonresidential
district to the existing residential neighborhood; and
- To promote strong visual and pedestrian connections between the residential
neighborhood and the MIT campus and the Charles River.
2. The development is consistent with the provisions of the South Cambridgeport
Development Guidelines;

otherwise permitted in the Residence C District shall be permitted as of right,
provided the conditions set forth below are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 10.31, no variance for use shall be permitted in the Special District 10. For

the permitted uses in Paragraphs (A) (1) - (3) above, which use shall thereafter
be subject to all of the provisions of this Section 17.107.
(D) For structures satisfying the requirements of (B) above and in existence as of

Special District 14 shall be freestanding and unattached to any other building,
may contain no more than 5,000 square feet of GFA, and may contain no more
than six dwelling units.
17.505.7 Multiple Buildings. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.13, multiple
buildings may be built on any Lot in Special District 14, and the minimum distance
between buildings shall be 10 feet. Buildings that are connected below grade by
tunnels or by underground parking structures shall be considered multiple,
freestanding and unattached buildings for purposes of between-building
setbacks. The formula set forth in Section 5.13 shall not apply.
17.505.8 Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 17.505.8, all
requirements of Article 6.000 shall apply in Special District 14.
(a) With regard to the provisions of Section 6.22  Location of accessory
off street parking facilities, at least eighty (80) percent of the minimum
required accessory parking required by Article 6.000 to serve
17-43
development constructed in the Athens Terrace Subdistrict shall be
located in that Subdistrict.
(b) For any development subject to the special permit provisions of

quality general and technical office environment which enhances the
Massachusetts Avenue street front in this area by promoting active uses at the
street level, encouraging building heights and massing that are appropriately
scaled within the context of surrounding structures, and creating an improved
pedestrian environment through the introduction of open space, the creation of
pedestrian connections that enhance links between Kendall and Central Squares
and the nearby residential neighborhood, and the elimination of surface parking
lots.
17.603 Permitted Uses. Uses permitted in the Industry B District shall be equally allowed
in Special District 15.
17-45
17.604 Dimensional Regulations
17.604.1 Maximum FAR. The maximum FAR for any lot in the district shall be 3.5.

increased to one hundred forty (140) feet by special permit from the Planning
Board.
17.605 Criteria for Granting Special Permit. In granting a Special Permit for additional
height above one hundred twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give
consideration to the following:
1. Only a portion of the building, not to exceed more than thirty percent
(30%) of the district, will extend to one hundred forty (140) feet.
2. Portions of the building along Massachusetts Avenue will not exceed 85
feet in height.
3. The additional height will allow for greater opportunities for open space
on the site, including plazas, landscaped areas, and pedestrian
pathways.
17.606 Parking. Notwithstanding the requirements of Article 6.000, the maximum ratio of
off-street parking for all non-residential uses shall be 0.90 spaces per 1,000
square feet of Gross Floor Area. Parking that exceeds this ratio shall require a
waiver under the general provisions of Article 6.000.
For any project seeking a special permit from the Planning Board,
the Planning Board in its discretion, after review and analysis of
Transportation Impact Studies and other relevant information on
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the
guidance of City agencies, may approve a request for reduction in
off-street parking that it deems appropriate without requiring a waiver
under Article 6.000.
17.607 Design Guidelines. In accordance with the provisions of Section 19.22, any new
building construction in this Special District that exceeds the Land Use
Thresholds set forth in Section 19.23 is required to obtain a Project Review
Special Permit. In addition to the Citywide Urban Design Objectives enumerated
in Section 19.30, the Planning Board shall, when making a determination on an
application for a Project Review Special Permit in Special District 15, consider the
following Design Guidelines:

floor building frontage along Massachusetts Avenue shall create
an active street presence with a particular emphasis on retail
uses and shall be generally 50% transparent.
6. The applicant should indicate how a proposed building would
relate physically to the most current design plans developed by
the MBTA for implementation of the Urban Ring transportation
project.
7. Attention should be given to walkability, with appropriate sidewalk
widths, maintenance of street trees, and other pedestrian friendly
amenities.
8. The site massing should include a variety of heights to provide
visual interest and break-up building mass.
17.608 Consistency with Letter of Commitment. Prior to the issuance of any building
permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any construction authorized by special
permit under the provision of this Section 17.600, the Community Development
Department shall certify to the Inspectional Services Department that all

ARTICLE 19.000 PROJECT REVIEW
19.10 Intent and Purpose
19.20 Project Review Special Permit
19.30 Urban Design Objectives
19.40 Advisory Development Consultation Procedures
19.50 Building and Site Plan Requirements
19.10 Intent and Purpose of Article 19.000
The intent of this Article 19.000 is to establish traffic and urban design standards for
development projects likely to have significant impact on abutting properties and the
surrounding urban environment.
To realize this intent, Article 19.000 (1) codifies the citys urban design objectives and
establishes detailed building and site development standards to regulate new building
construction in the citys commercial and high density residential areas, (2) establishes
standards by which significant adverse traffic impacts can be measured, and (3)
establishes procedures by which individual proposals can be reviewed by the Planning
Board, city staff and the general public before a building permit is issued.
The Building and Site Plan Requirements describe the minimally acceptable arrangement
of buildings on a lot and as they face the public environment. The Urban Design
Objectives establish more general guidelines which, along with the Traffic Impact
Indicators, can assist property owners as they consider alternate uses for their property.
Where a special permit is required from the Planning Board, the Urban Design
Objectives and Traffic Impact Indicators serve as considerations through which the
merits of a proposal are judged.
To apply the Building Requirements and Objectives effectively, procedures are
established by which public review of new construction can be undertaken. The
procedures provide an opportunity for the general public to review and comment on
significant new development projects and, where appropriate, they allow the Planning
Board, through a special permit process, to establish conditions by which new
development can be shaped to serve city urban design objectives more effectively. It is
the intent of these procedures to provide a method by which new development proposals
can be assessed at an early stage. Such assessment offers the opportunity to explore
potential modifications and refinements that would better serve the interests of both the
city and the project proponent. Similarly, potential negative impacts can be identified and
modifications explored that would reduce or eliminate them.
It is understood that nonprofit educational and religious uses and activities have special
use, building and site development requirements and characteristics. Therefore the
procedures and standards established in this Article 19.000 are designed to reflect those
special circumstances. In reviewing any development proposal of a nonprofit educational
or religious organization, the reviewing body shall apply the standards herein contained
19-2
in a reasonable manner in light of the special circumstances applicable to nonprofit
religious and educational activities.
This Article 19.000 shall apply to any new construction of a building or structure, addition
to a building or structure, or a change of use in an existing building undertaken on or after
September 15, 2000.
19.20 PROJECT REVIEW SPECIAL PERMIT
19.21 Purpose. It is the intent of this Section 19.20 to ensure that new construction or changes
of use in existing buildings (1) are consistent with the urban design objectives of the City
and (2) do not impose substantial adverse impacts on city traffic. A special permit
process is established by which the Planning Board may make such findings.
19.21.1 Purpose of Traffic Impact Review. The Planning Board shall assess the impact of the
vehicular service and passenger car traffic and pedestrian and bicycle circulation and
expected to be generated by a proposed development project. The procedures and
requirements of this Section 19.20 are intended to encourage applicants to adopt a
development program that reduces the number of single occupancy vehicles coming to
the site. Such a program would encourage pedestrian and bicycle access to the site and
throughout the neighboring district and reduce potential negative impacts on abutting
properties of the vehicles coming to the site. While the review will focus especially on
the impacts affecting abutting properties and the immediate environment, the impacts on
streets and locations more distant from the site and on transit and bus facilities serving
the site will also be assessed.
19.21.21 Purpose of Urban Design Review. The Board shall review the specific design
details of buildings and their site layout to ensure that the design of the building and its
location on the lot minimize any potential negative impact on abutting properties and on
the environment along public streets and sidewalks. Particular attention will be paid to
the design of the ground floor; the layout of service facilities including driveways, and
parking and loading facilities; the location and screening of mechanical service
equipment and waste disposal facilities; landscape amenities; and similar building and
site layout details.
19.22 Applicable Zoning Districts. The Project Review Special Permit shall apply to construction
and changes of use located in the following zoning districts.
(1) All Office, Business, and Industrial Districts, any PUD district, and NP districts, and
any Special District for which an office, business or industrial district serves as the
underlying base regulation (SD-1, SD-3, SD-5, SD-7, SD-8 and SD-11), but
excluding the MXD district.
(2) Residence C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, and C-3B districts, and any Special
District for which any one of these residence districts serves as the underlying base
regulation (SD-2, SD-6, SD-12 and SD-13) and SD-14. A Project Review Special
Permit in these districts shall be required only where the construction or portion of
19-3
the construction is located within one hundred (100) feet of a public way unless the
uses proposed in the building are subject to the thresholds established in Table 1.
19.23 Special Permit Threshold. A Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new
building construction of fifty thousand (50,000) gross square feet or more, in all
applicable zoning districts [except that in a Business A, Business A-1, and Business A-2
districts a Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new building construction
of twenty thousand (20,000) gross square feet or more], or for building construction of
less than fifty thousand square feet [or twenty thousand square feet in the BA, BA-1, and
BA-2 Districts] where a Table I threshold has been met, on a lot or combination of
contiguous lots held in common ownership at any time after September 15, 2000. Where
a mix of uses is proposed the threshold shall be determined by the application of the
Mixed Use Formula set forth in Table 1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 19.23 set forth above, the Project Review
Special Permit requirement shall not apply to existing gross floor area on a lot built and
occupied prior to the effective date of this Article 19. 000 that is demolished and
subsequently rebuilt as part of a building project, provided (1) there is no change of use,
(2) the reconstruction commences within two years of the start of demolition of the
building, and (3) the standards of Section 19.50 are met.
Where reference is made in this Section 19.23 to Gross Floor Area thresholds as set
forth in Table 1, the term shall also encompass any other measure of quantity
enumerated in the Table (e.g. dwelling units, beds, acres, parking spaces).

Mixed Use Formula
Where it is proposed to include a mix of uses in a new development, or substitute a mix
of uses for an existing use in an existing building, a special permit shall not be required
under the provisions of Section 19.20 if:
(GFA ? Thresholda ) + (GFA ? Thresholdb ) + (GFA ? Thresholdc ) ? 1
Where GFA is the proposed Gross Floor Area (or other indicated quantity measure) for
a use denoted by a subscript and where Threshold is the Threshold for that use in
Table 1.
19.23.1 Change of Use in an Existing Building Threshold
19.23.11 In an existing building, the Project Review Special Permit shall be required where
the total Gross Floor Area of a new use or uses on a lot exceeds the Gross Floor Area
threshold limits set forth in Table 1 for that new use. Where the change is to a mix of
uses the threshold shall be determined by the application of the Mixed Use Formula set
forth in Table 1.
19.23.2 Incremental Changes on a Lot. Any amount of Gross Floor Area on a lot, subject to this
Article 19.000, that is less than those threshold amounts set forth in Table 1 shall be
subject to this Section 19.20 only when the sum of the following equals or exceeds the
Gross Floor Area thresholds set forth in Sections 19.23 and 19.23.1 above:
(1) The current proposal for new Gross Floor Area on the lot, plus
(2) The Gross Floor Area on the lot developed or changed in use within the
preceding five years so as to be subject to this Section 19.20 but for which a
Special Permit under this Section 19.20 was not required, plus
(3) Any Gross Floor Area on the lot for which a building permit has been issued
but which has yet to be built and occupied and for which a Special Permit
authorized by this Section 19.20 has not been issued within the preceding five
years.
After the granting of the first special permit under this Section 19.20, a subsequent
special permit shall only be required when the total of additional Gross Floor Area or new
19-7
uses exceeds the Gross Floor Area thresholds set forth in Sections 19.23 and 19.23.1
above.
19.23.3 Phased Project. Nothing in this Section 19.20 shall prohibit the Planning Board from
granting a special permit for a phased project to be built over an extended period of time,
which period shall be defined in the permit, provided sufficient information is available in
the application to permit the Board to make the findings required.
19.23.4 Special Permit Thresholds Exemptions. Construction of a new building or a change of
use that has been granted a Planning Overlay Special Permit (IPOP), under the
provisions of Section 11.500 of this Ordinance in effect from July 1, 1998 through
October 2, 2000 (Ordinance # 1209 and subsequent amendments), shall not be subject
to this Section 19.20. However, any change of use in the authorized building subsequent
to occupancy as authorized under the provisions of a Section 11.500 special permit, shall
require the issuance of a Project Review Special Permit under this Section 19.20 where
the proposed new use exceeds the relevant threshold established in Table 1.

architectural screening treatment proposed for that mechanical equipment. The
proponent shall provide perspectives of the proposed development, including
mechanical equipment, from all critical viewpoints.
(2) Traffic Study. Where the use thresholds established in Table 1 are met or
exceeded, the application shall include a traffic study with a geographic and
functional scope determined by the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department (TPTD) to be appropriate to the location of the project. In general,
the study shall review intersections where the project will have significant and
measurable impact. The TPTD shall issue a certification to the applicant within
twenty-one (21) days of its submission that the traffic study has been done in a
complete and reliable manner. Where that certification is denied, the applicant
may revise the information in the traffic study and resubmit it; a certification of the
revised study shall be issued or denied by the TPTD within fourteen (14) days of
the resubmission of material.
Based on guidelines established by TPTD, the traffic study shall include a
narrative discussion of (a) the nature and quantity of vehicles traveling to the site
including, in addition to passenger cars, service, delivery and other commercial
vehicles, (b) the likely impact of such vehicular traffic on abutters, abutting
streets and nearby residential streets, including on-street parking behavior, (c)
the physical nature of pedestrian and bicycle access to the site and the quantity
19-8
of movements anticipated for each, and (d) an analysis of the crash history at
intersections within the study area. The study shall identify parking and
transportation demand management measures and other mitigation measures
proposed to ameliorate any adverse traffic impacts identified in the study.
(3) Tree Study. A Tree Study, certified complete by the City Arborist, as required
by the Tree Protection Ordinance of the City of Cambridge, Chapter 8.66.
(4) Urban Design Objectives Narrative. The application shall include a narrative
description of how the proposal addresses each of the seven Urban Design
Objectives set forth in Section 19.30. In addition the applicant shall comment
specifically on the following: (a) the design and location of proposed mechanical
equipment, including HVAC equipment, as well as a strategy for possible future
expansion, if relevant, (b) location and operation of trash storage and removal
systems, (c) location and operation of loading facilities, (d) measures taken to
minimize the negative visual and noise impacts of such facilities on abutters, and
(e) the provision in the building and site design to accommodate pedestrian,
bicycle and transit access.
(5) Sewer Service Infrastructure Narrative. The application shall include a report
by the applicant detailing the anticipated impact of the project on the citys
sanitary, stormwater, and combined sewer infrastructure. It shall indicate the
adequacy of the preliminary site plan in meeting city, state, and federal
requirements or established standards for implementation of best management
practices for stormwater management and the likely improvements to
infrastructure necessary to accommodate the impacts of the proposed project.
Where such determinations cannot be made at the time of application, the report
shall indicate what investigations must be undertaken by the applicant to make
such determination, their anticipated costs, and the schedule for their completion.
The applicant shall provide certification that this report has been submitted to the
Department of Public Works.
(6) Water Service Infrastructure Narrative. The application shall include a report
by the applicant detailing the anticipated impact of the project on the citys water
delivery infrastructure and supply. It shall indicate the likely improvements to
infrastructure necessary to accommodate the identified impacts. Where such
determinations cannot be made at the time of application, the report shall
indicate what investigations must be undertaken by the applicant to make such
determination, their anticipated costs, and the schedule for their completion. The
applicant shall provide certification that this report has been submitted to the
Water Department.
(7) Noise Mitigation Narrative. The application shall include a report detailing
how the project shall conform to the requirements of the Cambridge Noise
Ordinance. The report shall indicate the approaches to be adopted by the
applicant in minimizing the impact of noise from the project on neighbors. When
a project consists entirely or in part of residential uses located in a mixed-use or
19-9
commercial or industrial area, the narrative shall describe how building materials,
building design, building orientation, and site layout are being used to reduce the
transmission of noise to the residences from the surrounding environment.
19.25 Review Criteria. In granting a special permit under this Section 19.20 the Planning Board
shall make the following findings.
19.25.1 Traffic Impact Findings. Where a Traffic Study is required as set forth in Section 19.24 (3)
above the Planning Board shall grant the special permit only if it finds that the project will
have no substantial adverse impact on city traffic within the study area as analyzed in the
Traffic Study. Substantial adverse impact on city traffic shall be measured by reference to
the traffic impact indicators set forth in Section 19.25.11 below.
In areas where the Planning Board determines that area-specific traffic guidelines have
been established in the Ordinance, the Board recognizes written agreements between
project proponents and the City dealing with transportation mitigation strategies.
19.25.11 Traffic Impact Indicators. In determining whether a proposal has substantial adverse
impacts on city traffic the Planning Board shall apply the following indicators. When one
or more of the indicators is exceeded, it will be indicative of potentially substantial
adverse impact on city traffic. In making its findings, however, the Planning Board shall
consider the mitigation efforts proposed, their anticipated effectiveness, and other
supplemental information that identifies circumstances or actions that will result in a
reduction in adverse traffic impacts. Such efforts and actions may include, but are not
limited to, transportation demand management plans; roadway, bicycle and pedestrian
facilities improvements; measures to reduce traffic on residential streets; and measures
undertaken to improve safety for pedestrians and vehicles, particularly at intersections
identified in the Traffic Study as having a history of high crash rates.
The indicators are: (1) Project vehicle trip generation weekdays and weekends for a
twenty-four hour period and A. M. and P.M. peak vehicle trips generated; (2) Change in
level of service at identified signalized intersections; (3) Increased volume of trips on
residential streets; (4) Increase of length of vehicle queues at identified signalized
intersections; and (5) Lack of sufficient pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The precise
numerical values that will be deemed to indicate potentially substantial adverse impact
for each of these indicators shall be adopted from time to time by the Planning Board in
consultation with the TPTD, published and made available to all applicants.
19.25.2 Urban Design Findings. The Planning Board shall grant the special permit only if it finds
that the project is consistent with the urban design objectives of the city as set forth in
Section 19.30. In making that determination the Board may be guided by or make
reference to urban design guidelines or planning reports that may have been developed
for specific areas of the city and shall apply the standards herein contained in a
reasonable manner to nonprofit religious and educational organizations in light of the
special circumstances applicable to nonprofit religious and educational activities.
19.30 Citywide Urban Design Objectives
19-10
The following urban design objectives are intended to provide guidance to property
owners and the general public as to the citys policies with regard to the form and
character desirable for new development in the city. It is understood that application of
these principles can vary with the context of specific building proposals in ways that,
nevertheless, fully respect the policies intent. It is intended that proponents of projects,
and city staff, the Planning Board and the general public, where public review or approval
is required, should be open to creative variations from the detailed provisions presented
in this Section as long as the core values expressed are being served. A project need
not meet all the objectives of this Section 19.30 where this Section serves as the basis
for issuance of a special permit. Rather the permit granting authority shall find that on
balance the objectives of the city are being served. Nor shall a project subject to special
permit review be required to conform to the Required Building and Site Plan
Requirements set forth in Section 19.50.
Further indicators of conformance with these policy objectives shall be found in planning
documents and plans developed for specific areas of the city or the city as a whole, to the
extent that they are not inconsistent with the objectives set forth in this Section 19.30.
These documents include the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, the Central
Square Action Plan, the Central Square Development Guidelines, the North
Massachusetts Avenue Urban Design Guidelines Handbook, the University Park at MIT
Urban Design Guidelines, the North Point Policy Plan and Design Guidelines, the
Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan,
the Eastern Cambridge Plan, the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines, the Alewife
Revitalization, Alewife Urban Design Study Phase II and its Draft update of 1991, and
Toward a Sustainable Future: Cambridge Growth Policy Document.
19.31 New projects should be responsive to the existing or anticipated pattern of development.
Indicators include:
(1) Heights and setbacks provide suitable transition to abutting or nearby residential
zoning districts that are generally developed to low scale residential uses.
(2) New buildings are designed and oriented on the lot so as to be consistent with the
established streetscape on those streets on which the project lot abuts. Streetscape is
meant to refer to the pattern of building setbacks and heights in relationship to public
streets.
(3) In mixed-use projects, uses are to be located carefully to respect the context, e.g.
retail should front onto a street, new housing should relate to any adjacent existing
residential use, etc.
(4) Where relevant, historical context are respected, e.g. special consideration should be
given to buildings on the site or neighboring buildings that are preferably preserved.
19.32 Development should be pedestrian and bicycle-friendly, with a positive relationship to its
surroundings. Indicators include:
(1) Ground floors, particularly where they face public streets, public parks, and
publicly accessible pathways, consist of spaces that are actively inhabited by
19-11
people, such as retail stores, consumer service businesses and restaurants
where they are allowed, or general office, educational or residential uses and
building lobbies. Windows and doors that normally serve such inhabited spaces
are encouraged to be a prominent aspect of the relevant building facades. Where
a mix of activities are accommodated in a building, the more active uses are
encouraged facing public streets, parks and pathways.
In commercial districts, such active space consists of retail and consumer service
stores and building lobbies that are oriented toward the street and encourage
pedestrian activity on the sidewalk. However, in all cases such ground floor
spaces should be occupied by uses (a) permitted in the zoning district within
which the building is located, (b) consistent with the general character of the
environment within which the structure is located, and (c) compatible with the
principal use for which the building is designed.
(2) Covered parking on the lower floors of a building and on-grade open parking,
particularly where located in front of a building, is discouraged where a building
faces a public street or public park, and publicly accessible pathways.
(3) Ground floors should be generally 25-50% transparent. The greatest amounts
of glass would be expected for retail uses with lesser amounts for office,
institutional or residential use.
(4) Entries to buildings are located so as to ensure safe pedestrian movement
across streets, encourage walking as a preferred mode of travel within the city
and to encourage the use of public transit for employment and other trips.
Relating building entries as directly as possible to crosswalks and to pathways
that lead to bus stops and transit stations is encouraged; siting buildings on a lot
and developing site plans that reinforce expected pedestrian pathways over the
lot and through the district is also encouraged.
(5) Pedestrians and bicyclists are able to access the site safely and conveniently;
bicyclists should have, secure storage facilities conveniently located on-site and
out of the weather. If bicycle parking is provided in a garage, special attention
must be aid to providing safe access to the facilities from the outside.
(6) Alternate means of serving this policy objective 19.32 through special building
design, siting, or site design can be anticipated where the building form or use is
distinctive such as freestanding parking structures, large institutional buildings
such as churches and auditoriums, freestanding service buildings, power plants,
athletic facilities, manufacturing plants, etc.
19.33 The building and site design should mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a
development upon its neighbors. Indicators include:
19-12
(1) Mechanical equipment that is carefully designed, well organized or visually
screened from its surroundings and is acoustically buffered from neighbors.
Consideration is given to the size, complexity and appearance of the equipment,
its proximity to residential areas, and its impact on the existing streetscape and
skyline. The extent to which screening can bring order, lessen negative visual
impacts, and enhance the overall appearance of the equipment should be taken
into account. More specifically:
(a) Reasonable attempts have been made to avoid exposing rooftop
mechanical equipment to public view from city streets. Among the
techniques that might be considered are the inclusion of screens or a
parapet around the roof of the building to shield low ducts and other
equipment on the roof from view.
(b) Treatment of the mechanical equipment (including design and massing
of screening devices as well as exposed mechanical elements) that
relates well to the overall design, massing, scale and character of the
building.
(c) Placement of mechanical equipment at locations on the site other than
on the rooftop (such as in the basement), which reduces the bulk of
elements located on the roof; however, at-grade locations external to the
building should not be viewed as desirable alternatives.
(d) Tall elements, such as chimneys and air exhaust stacks, which are
typically carried above screening devices for functioning reasons, are
carefully designed as features of the building, thus creating interest on
the skyline.
(e) All aspects of the mechanical equipment have been designed with
attention to their visual impact on adjacent areas, particularly with regard
to residential neighborhoods and views and vistas.
(2) Trash that is handled to avoid impacts (noise, odor, and visual quality) on
neighbors, e.g. the use of trash compactors or containment of all trash storage
and handling within a building is encouraged.
(3) Loading docks that are located and designed to minimize impacts (visual and
operational) on neighbors.
(4) Stormwater Best Management Practices and other measures to minimize
runoff and improve water quality are implemented.
(5) Landscaped areas and required Green Area Open Space, in addition to
serving as visual amenities, are employed to reduce the rate and volume of
stormwater runoff compared to pre-development conditions.
(6) The structure is designed and sited to minimize shadow impacts on
neighboring lots, especially shadows that would have a significant impact on the
use and enjoyment of adjacent open space and shadows that might impact the
19-13
operation of a Registered Solar Energy System as defined in Section 22.60 of
this Zoning Ordinance.
(7) Changes in grade across the lot are designed in ways that minimize the need
for structural retaining walls close to property lines.
(8) Building scale and wall treatment, including the provision of windows, are
sensitive to existing residential uses on adjacent lots.
(9) Outdoor lighting is designed to provide minimum lighting and necessary to
ensure adequate safety, night vision, and comfort, while minimizing light
pollution.
(10) The creation of a Tree Protection Plan that identifies important trees on the
site, encourages their protection, or provides for adequate replacement of trees
lost to development on the site.
19.34 Projects should not overburden the City infrastructure services, including neighborhood
roads, city water supply system, and sewer system. Indicators include:
(1) The building and site design are designed to make use of water-conserving
plumbing and minimize the amount of stormwater run-off through the use of best
management practices for stormwater management.
(2) The capacity and condition of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure
systems are shown to be adequate, or the steps necessary to bring them up to
an acceptable level are identified.
(3) Buildings are designed to use natural resources and energy resources
efficiently in construction, maintenance, and long-term operation of the building,
including supporting mechanical systems that reduce the need for mechanical
equipment generally and its location on the roof of a building specifically. The
buildings are sited on the lot to allow construction on adjacent lots to do the
same. Compliance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certification standards and other evolving environmental efficiency standards is
encouraged.
19.35 New construction should reinforce and enhance the complex urban aspects of
Cambridge as it has developed historically. Indictors include:
(1) New educational institutional construction that is focused within the existing
campuses.
(2) Where institutional construction occurs in commercial areas, retail, consumer
service enterprises, and other uses that are accessible to the general public are
provided at the ground (or lower) floors of buildings. Where such uses are not
suitable for programmatic reasons, institutional uses that encourage active
pedestrian traffic to and from the site.
19-14
(3) In large, multiple-building non-institutional developments, a mix of uses,
including publicly accessible retail activity, is provided where such uses are
permitted and where the mix of uses extends the period of time the area remains
active throughout the day.
(4) Historic structures and environments are preserved.
(5) Preservation or provision of facilities for start-up companies and appropriately
scaled manufacturing activities that provide a wide diversity of employment paths
for Cambridge residents as a component of the development; however, activities
heavily dependent on trucking for supply and distribution are not encouraged.
19.36 Expansion of the inventory of housing in the city is encouraged. Indicators include:
(1) Housing is a component of any large, multiple building commercial
development. Where such development abuts residential zoning districts
substantially developed to low-scale residential uses, placement of housing
within the development such that it acts as a transition/buffer between uses
within and without the development.
(2) Where housing is constructed, providing affordable units exceeding that
mandated by the Ordinance. Targeting larger family-sized middle income units is
encouraged.
19.37 Enhancement and expansion of open space amenities in the city should be incorporated
into new development in the city. Indicators include:
(1) On large-parcel commercial developments, publicly beneficial open space is
provided.
(2) Open space facilities are designed to enhance or expand existing facilities or
to expand networks of pedestrian and bicycle movement within the vicinity of the
development.
(3) A wider range of open space activities than presently found in the abutting
area is provided.
19.40 Citywide Advisory Development Consultation Procedures
19.41 General Purpose
This Section 19.40 provides the opportunity for City staff and the general public (1) to
review and comment on development proposals prior to the formulation of final plans and
before the issuance of a building permit and (2) to determine compliance with the zoning
requirements applicable to the development. Each application for a building permit for
one of the categories of development specified in Sections 19.42 and 19.43 shall be
accompanied by a written certification from the Cambridge Community Development
Department indicating that the applicant has participated in the Development
Consultation Procedure specified in this Section 19.40, for the proposal for which the
19-15
permit is being sought. In each instance where the application for a building permit
occurs more than six (6) months after the consultation session, the Community
Development Department shall additionally certify to the Superintendent of Buildings
whether the plans submitted for a building permit are consistent with those reviewed at
the consultation session, and if not how they differ. Unless otherwise indicated elsewhere
in the Zoning Ordinance, the Community Development Department shall conduct the
consultation session. No certification pursuant to provisions of this Section 19.40 shall
be deemed to be in lieu of the responsibility of the Superintendent of Buildings to enforce
all provisions of the Zoning Ordinance - each Certificate of Compliance is advisory to the
applicant and the Superintendent of Buildings.
19.41.1 Purpose of the Small Project Review Procedure. In zoning districts designated as Areas
of Special Planning Concern, the advisory Small Project Review is intended to provide an
informal forum within which the small details of a proposal can be reviewed by city staff.
Small, incremental changes to a building, a streetscape, or a neighborhood can over time
significantly alter the character and quality of the urban environment. This procedure
provides an opportunity for city staff to influence the design of such small details in order
to encourage that the changes are consistent with city urban design objectives,
individually and as they accumulate overtime.
19.41.2 Purpose of the Large Project Review Procedure. In zoning districts designated as Areas
of Special Planning Concern, the advisory Large Project Review serves the same
purpose as the Small Project Review for somewhat larger changes in the environment
with somewhat greater impacts on the public realm. The Large Project Procedure
provides the opportunity for abutters and the general public, as well as city staff, to
review and make comment on the proposal at the consultation session.
19.42 Small Project Review Procedure
19.42.1 Applicability of Small Project Review Procedure. For those zoning districts identified in
Section 19.46 as Areas of Special Planning Concern, the following types of development
proposals shall be subject to the Small Project Development Consultation Procedure
(unless the regulations for an individual Area of Special Planning Concern provide for
specific exceptions or additional types):
(1) construction of any new building having a gross floor area of less than two
thousand (2,000) square feet;
(2) construction of any other new structure having a floor area of less than two
thousand (2,000) square feet;
(3) any exterior building alteration increasing gross floor area by one hundred
(100) square feet or more
(4) construction of five or more parking spaces, whether on grade or in a
structure;
(5) erection of a sign;
19-16
(6) any other exterior building alteration facing a street but not including painting,
brick repointing or masonry repairs, building cleaning, gutter replacement or
similar routine repair, replacement, or maintenance.
19.42.2 Application for a Small Project Review. Prior to application for a building permit, the
applicant shall contact the Community Development Department and request a
development consultation session. Upon making such a request, the applicant shall
present for review such written or graphic materials necessary to give a reasonably
complete, though not necessarily detailed, indication of the nature and scope of the
development proposal. The consultation session shall occur no later than five working
days after the request for such a consultation.
19.42.3 Conduct of the Small Project Review Consultation. In most cases the Community
Development Department staff person will complete the review and issue the certification
of the compliance with this Section 19.42 at the end of the consultation session.
However, if questions arise during the session suggesting the need for advice and
assistance of other city departments or others, the development proposal materials may
be kept for further review. However, the final staff comments and the issuance of the
Certificate of compliance shall be made within five (5) business days of the consultation
session.
The failure of the Community Development Department to hold the consultation session
or to issue the Certificate of Compliance within the review time periods specified in this
Section 19.42.3 shall not prevent an applicant for a building permit from receiving such
permit after such time period has expired. The specified review period may be extended
by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Community Development Department.
19.43 Large Project Review Procedure
19.43.1 Applicability of Large Project Review Procedure. For those zoning districts identified in
Section 19.46 as Areas of Special Planning Concern, any development proposal
involving the construction of a new building or new structure or an alteration of an
existing building or structure that increase the gross floor by two thousand (2,000) square
feet but less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet.
19.43.2 Application for a Large Project Review. Prior to application for a building permit, the
applicant shall submit the following materials to the Community Development Department
for its review. The written and graphic materials listed below shall give a reasonably
complete indication of the nature and scope of the development proposal. Each of the
following shall be submitted as appropriate to the proposal:
(1) A site plan indicating the general location and boundaries of the lot, major
anticipated changes in natural features, existing and proposed buildings, publicly
beneficial open space and/or useable beneficial open space and/or private open
space, existing and proposed curb cuts, off street parking areas, loading and
service facilities, and generalized landscaping scheme or other anticipated
treatment of open spaces.
19-17
(2) Cross section(s), generalized floor plans and other diagram(s) indicating the
anticipated locations of various land uses within the building and on the site and
major pedestrian pathways.
(3) Architectural elevations or sketches indicating anticipated facade treatment
along public ways including the proposed entrances, fenestration, and signage.
(4) A summary indicating compliance with applicable zoning requirements.
19.43.3 Conduct of the Large Project Review Consultation. Abutters and representatives of
various agencies and interest groups shall be invited to participate in a consultation
session for Large Project proposals submitted for review in accordance with Section
19.43.2. The Community Development Department shall give notification of any
scheduled development consultation to each abutting property owner and to any
individual or organization who each year files with the Community Development
Department a written request for such notification, or to any other individual or
organization the Department may wish to notify.
Within ten (10) business days of submittal of the application documents, the Department
will schedule and hold a consultation session with the applicant or his designee and any
parties listed in this Section 19.43.3. Within ten (10) days of the consultation session, the
Community Development Department shall issue to the applicant written comments on
the development proposal as expressed by City staff and others in attendance, which
shall constitute the Certificate of Compliance.
The Community Development Department may seek the advice and assistance of other
City departments and of the organizations given notice of the consultation procedure in
reviewing a development proposal.
The failure of the Community Development Department to hold the consultation session
or to issue the Certificate of Compliance within the review time period specified in this
Section 19.43.3 shall not prevent an applicant for a building permit from receiving such
permit after such time period has expired. The specified review period may be extended
by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Community Development Department.
19.43.4 Review Criteria and Required Findings of the Large Project Review Procedure. In
reviewing each application, the Community Development Department shall:
(1) Evaluate the proposal for general compliance with zoning requirements, for
consistency with City development guidelines prepared for the proposal area, for
appropriateness in terms of other planned or programmed public or private
development activities in the vicinity and for consistency with the Citywide Urban
Design Objectives set forth in Section 19.30. The Department shall consider the
proposal in terms of the specific and general impact of the use and/or
dimensions proposed therein on the area of special planning concern and on
adjacent neighborhoods and shall further take account of the following
considerations: scale, bulk, density, aesthetic qualities, land use, traffic impacts
and other functional characteristics; parking and loading; and impact on public
services and facilities.
19-18
(a) Additional Criteria in Business A-4 District Ground Floor Retail uses of
less than 2,000 square feet which will serve as an amenity for the
surrounding residential neighborhood should be included in any building
greater than 20,000 square feet.
(2) Make recommendations in a written report to the applicant including general
approval or disapproval of the proposal and in connection therewith may suggest
specific project adjustments and alterations to further the purposes of this
Ordinance.
19.44 The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated October 5, 2015, signed by Eric
Hoagland on behalf of Observatory Hill Apartments, LLC (the LLC), acting on behalf of
the LLC as developer of the proposed development at 253 Walden Street, identified as
Map 272, Lot 17 in the records of the City of Cambridge (the Project), and the
Neighborhood Review Committee (NRC), consisting of residents of the surrounding
community , is incorporated by reference hereto and shall be binding upon the Project as
set forth in the MOU. The issues of any building permit or certificate of occupancy for the
Project shall be conditioned upon certification by the Commissioner of Inspectional
Services that the Project is in compliance with all provisions of the aforementioned MOU.
19.45 Waiver of Procedures. Where a special permit issued by the Planning Board is required
for a proposed development, no separate Small or Large Project Review Procedure shall
be required under the provisions of this Section 19.40.
19.46 Areas of Special Planning Concern. The following zoning districts shall be considered
Areas of Special Planning Concern: Business A-1 and Business A-2 and Business A-4
Districts, the Parkway Overlay District, the Kirkland Place Overlay District, the Harvard
Square Overlay District, the Central Square Overlay District, The Cambridgeport
Revitalization Development District, the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District, Special
District 12, Special District 13, Special District 14 and the Memorial Drive Overlay District,
Prospect Street Overlay District and the Alewife Overlay Districts.
19.50 Building and Site Plan Requirements
19.51 Applicability
19.51.1 Applicable Zoning Districts. This Section 19.50 shall apply in the following zoning
districts:
(1) All Office, Business, and Industrial Districts and NP districts, and any Special
District for which an office, business or industrial district serves as the underlying
base regulation (SD-1, SD-3, SD-5, SD-7, SD-8, and SD-11).
2) Residence C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, and C-3B districts, and any
Special District for which any one of these residence districts serves as the
underlying base regulation (SD-2, and SD-6) for a building or portion of a building
within one hundred (100) feet of a public street.
19-19
19.51.2 Applicable Construction. The building design and site development requirements set
forth in this Section 19.50 shall be required for the following construction projects:
(1) Any new building or structure of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gross square
feet or more.
(2) Any addition of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gross square feet or more to an
existing building or structure.
(3) Any alteration to the elements of a building of twenty-five thousand (25,000)
gross square feet or more, or any alteration of its site, that is regulated by this
Section 19.50, where the change is undertaken to accommodate a new use or
uses or where the change is to a building constructed pursuant to a building
permit certified to be in compliance with this Section 19.50 and where (a) the
alterations to accommodate the new use are proposed to the exterior of the
building, or on the lot outside the building and (b) those alterations would
increase the extent to which the building or lots physical configuration would
violate the requirements set forth in Section 19.50 to a greater extent than the
existing configuration.
Where applicable zoning district regulations differ from the requirements of this Section
19.50, the stricter provisions shall apply.
A project that does not comply with the requirements of this Section 19.50 shall not
receive a building permit until a Special Permit is granted by the Planning Board. The
Planning Board shall grant such special permit only upon finding that the project is
consistent with the Urban Design Objectives set forth in Section 19.30. Nothing in this
Section 19.50 shall prevent an applicant, not wishing to conform to the requirements of
this Section 19.50, from directly seeking a special permit from the Planning Board subject
to consistency with Section 19.30.
Any application for a Building Permit for development subject to this Section 19.50 shall
be accompanied by a Tree Study, certified complete by the City Arborist, as required by

19.52 Heights and Setbacks. The provisions of this Section 19.52 shall not apply to Special
District 8.
(1) For development on a lot abutting a lot in a residential zoning district having a
more restrictive height limit, the cornice line of the principal wall plane facing the
residential zoning district line shall not exceed by more than twenty (20) feet at
any point the maximum height permitted in the residential zoning district. Any
portion of the building rising above the cornice line shall be located below a fortyfive
(45) degree bulk control plane starting at ground level at the zoning district
line, subject to the following provisions.
(a) Where the zoning district line lies within a lot, the bulk control plane

restrictive yard requirements, the yard requirements of the residential district
shall apply to any portion of the development rising above the bulk control plane
set forth in Paragraph (1) above. As in (1) above, where the zoning district line
lies within a lot, the bulk control plane shall begin at the lot line in the residential
zoning district that divides the subject lot (including any intervening lots held in
identical ownership but not part of the development lot) from another lot in
different ownership. This Paragraph (2) shall not apply where the zoning district
line lies within or across a street.
19.53 Location of Uses
(1) In mixed-use developments containing a residential component (Section 4.31
 Residential uses, excluding Hotel and Motel use), the housing shall be located

20.10 TRANSITION OVERLAY DISTRICTS
These overlay districts are intended to apply special dimensional, use, and other
standards to development in areas where abutting zoning districts have significantly
different character in one or more use or dimensional aspects. It is intended that the
provisions of the overlay district will modify the form, location, and use of buildings
such that the use of land in each district will not be unreasonably negatively impacted
by the use of land in the adjoining district. The requirements of each overlay district
shall apply in addition to the requirements of the pertinent base zoning district; where
the base zoning regulations differ from the requirements of the overlay district, the
requirements of the overlay district shall apply.
20.11 Hammond and Gorham Streets Transition Overlay District

20.12.1 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Kirkland Place Transition
Overlay District which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified
in this Section 11.400. These regulations are intended to provide a transition between
the character and scale of the abutting A-2 residential district and the development
options possible in the base Residence C-3 zone. It is the intent of this Section that
these regulations will apply to a single area located at the westerly edge of Kirkland
Place, north of Kirkland Street and bounded and described as follows:
Amend the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by designating on the map as
the Kirkland Place Overlay District that area bounded and described below:
Beginning at a point, said point being the intersection of the westerly side line of
Kirkland Place and a line 135 feet distant from and parallel to the northerly street
line of Kirkland Street. Thence running westerly 90 feet to a point, said point
being the intersection of a line 135 feet distant from and parallel to the northerly
street line of Kirkland Place 402 feet to a point, said point being the intersection
of a line 90 feet distant from and parallel to the westerly street line of Kirkland
Place and the northerly lot line of lot numbered 45 as shown on Assessor's Plat
numbered 145. Thence turning and proceeding easterly along said northerly lot
line to the northeasterly corner of said lot numbered 45. Thence turning and
running southerly along the easterly lot line of lot numbered 45 to the intersection
of the lot line and the circular part of Kirkland Place. Thence turning and
proceeding southwesterly along the circular part of the westerly street line of
Kirkland Place approximately 62.69 feet. Thence turning and running southerly
along the western street line of Kirkland Place for a distance of approximately
327 feet, to the point of origin.
The affected premises: odd numbers 3-13 Kirkland Place, all or portions of lots
numbered 21, 37, 38, 39, and 45 as shown on Assessor's Plat numbered 145.
20.12.2 General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.12 to augment the existing
zoning regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change
particular to the Kirkland Place area. These regulations are intended to encourage
retention of buildings of historic value and enhance the established streetscape; to
maintain the visual character and open space patterns; and to provide sufficient
regulatory flexibility to advance the general purposes of this Section 20.12.2.
20.12.3 Applicability. The Kirkland Place Transition Overlay District shall be an overlay district
on the zoning map established by Section 3.20.
20-7
The buildings and land uses within said district shall be controlled by the pertinent
regulations within the base zoning district, except as modified by the requirements of
Section 20.12 which shall apply in addition to regulations imposed by the base zoning
map designation. Where the base zoning regulations differ from requirements of this
Section 20.12, the requirements of this Section shall apply. Divergence from the
standards established in this Section may be allowed only by issuance for a Special
Permit by the Planning Board as specified in Section 10.45. The Board may grant
such a permit upon its determination that the development proposed will better serve
the objectives of this Section 20.12 and that the criteria specified in Section 10.43 will
be satisfied.
20.12.4 The Kirkland Place Transition Overlay District shall be considered an area of special
planning concern.
Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, Development
Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development Consultation Procedure
specified in Section 19.40.
20.12.5 Use Regulations. Use regulations of the Residence C-3 zoning designation shall
apply in the Kirkland Place Transition Overlay District.
20.12.6 Dimensional Standards in the Kirkland Place Transition Overlay District
20.12.61 Floor Area Ratio. The above ground floor area ratio shall be the same as in the A-2
zoning district. The overall floor area ratio in the Transition Overlay District shall be
3.0. Any floor area created in excess of .5 must be completely below grade.
20.12.62 Maximum Height. The maximum height in the Transition Overlay District shall be 35
feet.
20.12.63 Setbacks. Building setbacks in the Transition Overlay District shall be the same as in
the Residence A-2 zoning district.
20.12.64 Private open space. Open space requirements in the Transition Overlay District shall
be the same as in the Residence A-2 zoning district.
20.12.65 Nonconforming structures. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.23, that
portion of a legal nonconforming structure lying within the Kirkland Place Transition
Overlay District which is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion or other catastrophe
may be rebuilt or restored and used again in the same way as it had been legally used
immediately before the damage, without limit as to cost of such rebuilding or restoring
provided the following conditions are met:
(a) any restoration or rebuilding shall commence within twelve (12) months after
the catastrophe; and
(b) the structure shall be restored or rebuilt to the same design, Including
materials and design details as existed previously; or should the restoration not
be feasible necessitating that the structure be rebuilt to a different design, said
design shall be at least equal to the origin design of the structure in quality of
20-8
materials used, the quantity and quality of design details employed, and the
compatibility of the site design with abutting properties;
(c) the Community Development Department shall certify to the Superintendent
of Buildings that the above conditions have been met.
Should the Community Development Department find that said conditions have
not been met, the restoring or rebuilding shall require a special permit from the
Board of Zoning Appeal.
The restored or rebuilt structure shall in no respect increase the nonconforming
nature of the original structure; nothing in this Section, however, shall prohibit a
rebuilding or restoring which reduces the nonconforming nature of the original
structure.
20.20 MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT (MXR)
20.21 Establishment and Purpose. There is hereby established the Mixed Use Residential
Overlay District as shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, as amended. It
is the intent of this Overlay District to modify base residential district regulations,
where a substantial inventory of non-residential uses already exists, such that: (1)
existing non residential activities, compatible with existing and future residential
construction, may continue, (2) retail and consumer service uses that might serve as
support for existing or future residential construction are permitted, and (3) future
residential construction on suitable sites is not inhibited. The Overlay District is
intended to facilitate a mixed use environment supportive of housing construction
within the district in the future while permitting existing non residential activities to
operate and adjust to changing circumstances through limited expansion in built area
in ways that will not negatively impact residential activities.
20.22 Permitted Non-Residential Uses and New Construction. A use not otherwise
permitted in the base residential district may be permitted in the Mixed Use Residential
Overlay District where such use is allowed or conditionally allowed in the Industry A-1
district, subject to the following conditions and limitations and the procedures
established in Section 20.24 below.
a. The use does not replace an existing residential use or, if the lot or area of a
building proposed to be the location a non-residential use is vacant, no residential
use had been established at any time in the previous five years.
b. Retail uses, Sections 4.35 and 4.36, shall only be permitted on the first floor
and basement of a building, shall be located in a building containing other uses,
and may not exceed more than twenty-five (25) percent of the gross floor area of
the building in which they are located, or alternately no more than twenty-five (25)
percent of the total area of a development proposal or any combination of existing
and proposed buildings if so permitted by the Planning Board. No individual retail
establishment may exceed 2500 gross square feet in area unless specifically
permitted by the Planning Board.
20-9
c. Transportation, communication and utility uses, Section 4.32; Office and
Laboratory Uses, Section 4.34; Light industry, wholesale business or storage
uses, Section 4.37; or Heavy industry uses, Section 4.38 may be permitted in an
existing building, or as an addition to an existing building or as new construction
on a vacant lot provided the additional gross floor area is to serve uses or
operations already in existence in the district.
d. Parking lot or parking garage for private passenger cars, Section 4.32 b shall
be prohibited.
20.23 Dimensional Limitations. The Gross Floor Area for any non-residential use or
combination of non-residential uses on a lot shall be limited by the FAR set forth below
for the applicable residential base district.
a. Residence C: 0.6
b. Residence C-1: 0.75
c. Residence C-1A: 1.0
d. Residence C-2: 1.25
e. Residence C-2B: 1.25
f. Residence C-2A: 1.5
g. Residence C-3: 2.0
h. Residence C-3B: 2.0
All other dimensional requirements of the residential district shall continue to apply.
20.24 Procedures.
20.24.1 Changes Permitted As-of-Right.
Any structure existing or authorized by permit as of September 15, 2000, which
contains a non-residential use not permitted in the residential base district, may be
expanded in area to accommodate the existing use in an amount not to exceed, in
total for all additions, 15% of the existing Gross Floor Area of the building. In no case,
however, may the FAR on the lot after said addition or additions exceed that set forth
in Section 20.23 above.
20.24.2 Changes Permitted by Special Permit
All other changes of use, additions to existing buildings, or construction of new
buildings permitted in Section 20.22 above, and otherwise not permitted to proceed
as-of-right as set forth in Section 20.24.1 above, shall require the granting of a special
permit from the Planning Board
20.25 Criteria for Issuance of a Special Permit. Designation of the base residential zoning
district expresses the policy objective of the City of Cambridge that new construction in
the district should principally be for residential use, or for other uses permitted in the
residential base district. However, recognizing the present land use character of the
area, this Mixed Use Residential Overlay District provides flexibility such that existing
non-residential uses may continue to operate without unreasonable regulatory
20-10
impediment provided they do not now or will not in the future hinder the expansion or
introduction of residential uses to the district. Therefore, in granting a special permit
under this Section 20.20, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the following
and make appropriate findings related thereto:
1. The proposed new use or expansion of an existing use will contribute to a physical
and use environment that is supportive of residential uses, as for example the
introduction of ancillary retail and consumer services;
2. In its operations, scale, building design and location on the lot, the proposed use
or new constriction will not significantly impair the health, safety and welfare of
current residential occupants of the district or impair the prospects for construction
of new residential uses on adjacent lots or within the district, or alternately will
positively contribute to the health, safety and welfare of residents in the district;
3. In its design, the new construction could be reasonably converted to residential
use in the future;
4. Where it is proposed to construct a building on a vacant lot or where it is proposed
to expand an existing facility not used for residential purposes by more than fifteen
(15) percent of its existing gross floor area, the lot is not suitable for residential
use as indicated by its location and surrounding uses. Where the lot may be
suitable for residential use, the proposed construction is to serve an existing
operation or enterprise now in the district. That operation or enterprise shall be
found to be an important contributor to the Cambridge economy, through the
provision of employment, the generation of new ideas, products or processes, and
through the potential to expand and grow elsewhere in the city in areas intended
for non-residential development;
5. Special attention is paid in the design and layout of the new construction to
mitigate or prevent negative impacts on present and future residential uses,
including among other measures screening of mechanical equipment for visual or
acoustical reasons, location of refuse management systems within the structure,
and the location of loading and service delivery systems in the least obtrusive
areas of the lot.
20.30 Deleted
20.40 EASTERN CAMBRIDGE HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.41 Purpose. It is the intent of this Section 20.40 to provide an incentive for residential
development within the designated ECHO district as an extension of the existing
residential neighborhood and to permit housing to be developed in combination with
other uses permitted on a lot where a mix of uses is desirable. It is the intent of this
Section 20.40 to provide an incentive through additional development potential to
convert a lot devoted to non-residential uses to residential use.
20-11
20.42 Applicability. The ECHO District shall be an overlay district on the zoning map
established in Section 3.20. Buildings and land uses shall be controlled by the
pertinent regulations within the applicable base zoning districts and any other
regulations that may apply in the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, including
Section 5.30.12, except as modified by the provisions of this Section 20.40. Except as
modified by the provisions of this Section 20.40, the base district regulations shall
apply. Where reference is made in this Section 20.40 to residential uses, it shall mean
residential uses as set forth in Section 4.31 a-h.
20.43 Residential Development Density. The maximum permitted FAR for all residential
uses shall be twice the non-residential FAR permitted in the underlying base zoning
district, except that for those areas whose underlying base zoning district is Residence
C-1 the FAR shall be 0.75. For all areas within the ECHO District, the permitted
number of dwelling units on a lot shall be that permitted in the base zoning district.
However, where the proposed development has a residential FAR of at least 2.0 the
permitted number of dwelling units may be increased but shall not exceed one
dwelling unit for every 300 square feet of total lot area.
20.44 Maximum Height of Buildings and Maximum Permitted Non-Residential FAR. The
following limitations as to height of buildings shall only apply to new buildings or
additions to existing buildings. The permitted heights are set forth on the Eastern
Cambridge Housing Overlay District Height Limitation Map, Map 20.41. The permitted
heights are further described below. Where the maximum height permitted in this
Section 20.44 is thirty-five feet, it shall apply to all uses permitted in the applicable
base-zoning district. Where the height permitted is greater than forty-five feet, it shall
apply only to permitted residential uses. For any location not appearing on Map 20.41
or described below, the permitted heights shall be those permitted in the base zoning
district. The FAR set forth below shall apply to non-residential uses. Where no FAR is
indicated the non-residential FAR shall be that permitted in the applicable base zoning
district.

required for development in the ECHO District, the permit granting authority shall find
that the development is generally consistent with the policy objectives set forth in the
Eastern Cambridge Plan and the guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design
Guidelines. Any development permitted as-of-right is encouraged to be consistent with
the Guidelines.
20.46 Transfer of Development Rights. Development capacity may be transferred from the
areas designated within the ECHO District consistent with the regulations set forth in
Section 20.30 of this Ordinance.
20.47 Non-Conforming Uses. Notwithstanding any provision of Article 8.000, in the Eastern
Cambridge Housing Overlay District, any structure containing a non-conforming use
may be altered or enlarged without limit as to percent of enlargement in order to
accommodate expansion of that non-conforming use provided the structure or portion
of the structure to be altered or enlarged is located within a non-residential base
district and further provided that the structure will not be in further violation of the
dimensional requirements of this Section 20.40 or any applicable base district.
20.50 HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.51 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay
District and the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District which shall be governed by
the regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.50. It is the intent of this
section that these regulations will apply to an area described generally as the Harvard
Square business district and certain abutting portions of the neighborhoods around it.
20.51.1 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on the
Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square Historic
Overlay District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay district that is
encompassed by any historic district duly established by the City Council under the
authority granted by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any Neighborhood Conservation District
established by the City Council under the provisions of chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge
Municipal Code. All provisions of the Harvard Square Overlay District and all
references to it in this Ordinance shall apply equally to the Harvard Square Historic
Overlay District except as set forth below.
20-14
20.52 General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to
the Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more
careful public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban
form of the Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the
extreme development pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique
functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the
functional impacts of new development on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to
maintain the present diversity of development and open space patterns and building
scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory flexibility to advance the general
purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility granted to development within
the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to facilitate the protection and
enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square while not
unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary changes to the
built environment in the Harvard Square area.
20.53 General Provisions
20.53.1 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning
concern.
Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, Development
Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development Consultation Procedure
specified in Article 19.40 except that any Large Project Review (new buildings of 2,000
square feet or more) shall be conducted by the Harvard Square Advisory Committee
using procedures specified in Subsection 20.54.1 of this Section 20.50.
20.53.2 Criteria for Development Consultation Review and Review of Applications for Special
Permits and Variances.
In reviewing applications for variances, special permits or development consultation
reviews the permit or special permit granting authority or the Harvard Square Advisory
Committee shall be guided by the objectives and criteria contained in the publication
Harvard Square Development Guidelines [Document complied from the Guidelines for
Development and Historic Preservation as contained in the Final Report of the
Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee, dated
November 29, 2000 and the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, 1986], in
addition to the requirements of Sections 10.30 (Variances) and 10.40 (Special
Permits) and this Section 20.50. These guidelines are also intended to assist in
shaping any contemplated physical change within the Harvard Square Overlay District
20.53.3 National Register and Contributing Buildings
For the purposes of this Section 20.50 the following definitions shall apply:
1. National Register Building shall be a building individually listed or determined
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places as determined by the Secretary
of the Department of the Interior.
20-15
2. A contributing building shall be:
a. Identified as a contributing building in a listed or eligible National Register
District as determined by the Secretary of the Department of Interior; or
b. A building located outside a National Register District but identified as a
contributing building in the Harvard Square Development Guidelines,
Community Development Department, July 1, 1986.
However, a building shall no longer be considered a contributing building as
defined in this Subsection 20.53.3(b) for the purposes of this Section 20.50 if,
upon application for a demolition permit, the Cambridge Historical
Commission shall determine the building not to be a preferably preserved
significant building as defined in the City of Cambridge Demolition Ordinance
#965.

loading facilities and will in any case not generate vehicular traffic in quantity and
type substantially different from that generated by permitted uses.
20-18
i. The applicant can demonstrate a need for the use(s) as a service to adjacent
residential communities or to the academic community and can demonstrate that
for economic or other reasons the use cannot easily be located in existing
business or office districts where the use is permitted. In addition the applicant
must demonstrate that either the use has been displaced as result of
redevelopment elsewhere in the Harvard Square Overlay District, or that the use is
important in its contribution to the variety, continuity, or uniqueness of the Harvard
Square Overlay District.
j. The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.

4.35o (Fast Order Food Establishment);
4.35p (Massage establishment).
l. The proposed use is not located in a base Residence C-2B or Office 2 District.
2. In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the Table
of Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square Overlay
District.
3. The conditions and required findings mentioned in this Section 20.54.3 are not
severable, and if a court declares any such condition or required finding invalid, then
this Section 20.54.3 shall cease to operate in its entirety, and no additional special
permits shall be issued under its authority.
20.54.4 Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District
which meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and loading
requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and Loading
Requirements.
1. The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence on or
before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National Register or
contributing building; or
2. The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure identified in
(1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided:
a. The total development authorized on the site is reduced to eighty (80) percent of
the maximum permitted on the lot; or a cash contribution is made to the Harvard
20-19
Square Improvement Fund to be established by the City of Cambridge in an
amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the cost of construction of the spaces not
provided, said contribution to be used by the City of Cambridge for one or more of
the following capital improvements in the Harvard Square Overlay District:
(1) Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;
(2) Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic structures,
monuments and other features owned by the City of Cambridge or other
public agency or a nonprofit organization;
(3) Extension throughout the Harvard Square Overlay District of the surface
improvements installed by the MBTA as part of the Red Line subway
extension(brick sidewalks, light post, street furniture, etc.)
The Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make comments on
any proposal for the expenditure of such cash contributions. To the extent
practicable the provision of public parking facilities shall be the first priority of any
expenditure. The funds shall not be used for ordinary maintenance activities
normally undertaken by the City of Cambridge.
The value of the cash contribution shall be determined by the Community
Development Department assuming equivalent structured parking spaces and
using generally accepted cost estimation methods customarily used by architects
and engineers or using actual construction costs for comparable contemporary
parking construction in Cambridge.
b. The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a development
pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the retention of existing
structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a specific finding shall be made
that this objective has been met).
c. The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from parking and
loading requirements will result in a building design that is more appropriate to its
location and the fabric of its neighborhood and that it is in conformance with the
objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines.
d. No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing
building; and
e. No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered
so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years preceding
the application.
20.54.5 Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's positive
diversity of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards and
courtyards is encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to permit
design flexibility to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the character of
the area within which it is located. To this end any building in the Harvard Square
Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements as specified in Section
20-20
5.30, (except where such yard abuts a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay
District) if the following conditions are met:
1. The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been
issued by that date, or
2. For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning
district, for which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the
Planning Board issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard
requirements provided:
a. The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the objectives
and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines.
b. No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing
building; and
c. No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the site in
the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to terminate or
preclude its designation or demolished prior to the application.

20.55 Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District
20.55.1 All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic District,
except as modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow greater
flexibility in the size, location and illumination of signs in order to encourage more
thoughtful design of individual signs, to encourage greater respect for the building and
visual context within which new signs are erected, and thereby add interest and
character to the shopping environment in Harvard Square.
1. In Section 7.16.22  Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts,
Paragraphs A, B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts.
However, no sign on the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet
above grade.

20.60 PARKWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.61 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established a Parkway Overlay District
which shall be governed by the regulations specified in this Section 20.60. Within this
parkway district is also a subdistrict to be referred to as the Concord Avenue Parkway
Subdistrict. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to areas of
the city where development is likely to occur near major public open space
connectors, especially arterial roadways that could provide such connections.
20.62 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 11.60 to augment base zoning regulations in
designated areas in order to create unified identifiable images of designated areas, to
enhance public safety by reducing visual confusion and haphazard development, to
encourage development which will protect and enhance the use and enjoyment of
public open space resources. The Parkway Overlay District has been designated
specifically for the areas adjacent to arterial roadways located in parklike settings such
as the Fresh Pond Reservation. To more fully implement these objectives for a
portion of the Parkway Overlay District that includes the Fresh Pond Reservation, this
article includes special provisions for the Concord Avenue Parkway Subdistrict,
which is defined in section 20.69 and is subject to the provisions of that section, as
well as the provisions generally governing the Parkway Overlay District. The terms
the district or said district or the Parkway Overlay District shall mean both the
Parkway Overlay District and the Concord Avenue Subdistrict, unless specifically
noted otherwise.
20.63 Applicability. The Parkway Overlay District shall be an overlay district on the zoning
map established by Section 3.20. The Concord Avenue Parkway Subdistrict shall also
be shown on the map established by Section 3.20.
20.63.1 The buildings and land uses within said district shall be controlled by the pertinent
regulations within the base zoning districts, except as modified by the requirements of
this Section 20.60 which shall apply in addition to regulations imposed by the base
zoning map designations. Where the base zoning regulations differ from requirements
of this Section 20.60, the stricter provisions shall apply.
20.63.2 The requirements of this Section 20.60 shall not apply to Planned Unit Development
proposals filed, reviewed and regulated by Articles 12.000 and 13.000; however, said
requirements shall apply to other development proposals in a PUD district.
20.63.3 The requirements of this Section 20.60 shall not apply to lots containing one family,
two family or three family residences as principal uses.
20.63.4 The requirements of this Section 20.60 shall not apply to construction activities
incidental to emergency repairs of public utility facilities.
20.63.5 In reviewing applications for any special permit in the Parkway Overlay District, the
Planning Board shall consider compliance with the requirements specified in this
Section 20.60, the recommendations made in the Cambridge Community
Development Department's 1979 report entitled Alewife Revitalization, and the criteria
specified in Section 10.43.
20-22
20.63.6 Developments that must obtain a special permit under any section of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be exempt from the Development Consultation Procedures mandated
by Subsection 20.69. Compliance with the regulations and guidelines for the Parkway
Overlay District shall be considered in the context of the special permit review.
20.63.7 The development standards specified in this Section 20.60 shall apply to all
development within the Parkway Overlay District not exempted by subsections
20.63.2, 20.63.3, and 20.63.4. Divergence from these standards may be allowed only
by issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board as specified in Subsection
10.45. The Board may grant such a permit upon its determination that the
development proposed will better serve the objectives of this Section 20.60 than if the
standards were followed and that the criteria specified in Section 10.43 will be
satisfied.
20.64 Dimensional Standards in the Parkway Overlay District
20.64.1 Front Yards. Front yards should be of sufficient size and appropriately landscaped so
as to increase public safety and to positively contribute to the visual and environmental
quality of the district. Therefore the following standards shall apply:
1. The minimum front yard setback for the principal front wall plane for any
structure shall be twenty-five (25) feet measured from the street line. For corner
lots, only the front yard oriented toward Concord Turnpike, Alewife Brook
Parkway, Concord Avenue, or Fresh Pond Parkway shall be required to provide
this setback. The other front yard shall satisfy the minimum setback specified in
Section 5.30 for the base zoning district.
2. Required front yards shall consist entirely of Green Area Open Space as
defined in Article 2.000 with the exception of paving necessary for vehicular
access. Such paved access area shall be limited to one 24-foot driveway for each
one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage or fraction thereof.
3. Front yards shall contain at least one three (3) inch caliper tree for every
twenty-five (25) linear feet of street frontage.
4. Front yards may contain fences along front and side lot lines in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection 20.65.
20.64.2 Maximum Building Height. The transition from public open spaces to private
development should not be abrupt. Therefore, the maximum height of the principal
front wall plane of buildings in the Parkway Overlay District shall be fifty-five (55) feet.
Portions of buildings may be allowed to extend to eighty-five (85) feet in height
provided that those portions in excess of fifty-five (55) feet are set back from the
principal front wall plane at least ten (10) feet and that those portions also set back
from one or more sixty (60) degree building bulk control planes.
20.64.3 Building Facades. Building facades should be designed so as to enhance the visual
quality of the district. The following standards shall apply:
1. Principal building entrances shall face the parkways and boulevards which serve to
define the district.
20-23
2. Building facades and rooflines shall be articulated and expanses of unbroken wall
planes shall be limited to thirty-five (35) linear feet for those facades facing public open
space and/or public roadways.
3. Ground floor levels shall include a minimum of thirty (30) percent transparency to
enliven and enrich the public environment.
20.65 Fences. In order to maintain a feeling of openness, to facilitate pedestrian enjoyment
and use, and to maximize scenic views, fences along the front and side lot lines shall
comply with the following standards:
1. No fence along a front or side lot line and within twenty-five (25) feet of a
public right of way shall be more than four (4) feet in height from the curb level of
the street or more than thirty (30) percent opaque.
2. Chainlink and wire fences are prohibited.
20.66 Parking Standards. Development in the Parkway Overlay District shall conform to the
Off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as
modified by this Section 20.66.
20.66.1 Curb Cuts. Only one curb cut of a maximum of forty (40) feet shall be permitted per
one hundred (100) linear feet of street frontage in the Parkway Overlay District.
Wherever possible, curb cuts should be on local streets rather than arterial roadways
and in no case shall a curb cut be allowed within one hundred (100) feet of an
intersection unless the lot contains less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet of
street frontage.
20.66.2 Siting of Parking Areas. Parking areas, whether accessory or nonaccessory, shall not
be located in the front yard required for any lot in the district. Enclosed parking
facilities are encouraged. On grade, open area parking areas shall be located behind
the building or buildings served or arranged in such a way as to minimize their visibility
from public ways.
20.66.3 General Landscaping of On Grade, Open Parking. Landscaping of parking areas in
the district should help to ensure public safety, moderate the microclimate and
minimize noise, glare and the unsightly intrusion of automobiles and unbuffered hard
surfaces in the area of public open space. Therefore, any on grade open parking area
for ten (10) or more cars shall be required to meet the following landscaping
standards:
1. On grade, open parking areas shall be arranged and landscaped to properly
screen cars from public rights of way and pedestrian ways. Such screening shall
consist of a fence or wall not less than fifty (50) percent opaque and not less than
four (4) feet in height.
2. At least ten (10) percent of the area devoted to on grade open parking shall be
landscaped. The area devoted to on grade open parking shall be that portion of
the lot containing parking spaces, driveways and landscaped area located
between or adjacent to parking spaces and drives. No portion of the lot required
20-24
as a setback between parking spaces and a building or lot line shall be counted
in computing the ten (10) percent landscape requirement.
3. Each landscape area shall have minimum dimensions of three (3) feet.
4. Landscaped areas at least six (6) feet in width shall be used to divide parking
areas into bays of not more than twenty (20) spaces. Such landscaped areas
may be counted as part of the ten (10) percent required landscaped area.
20.66.4 Trees for Landscaping On grade, Open Parking Areas. The landscaping necessary to
meet the standards specified in Subsection 20.66.3 shall include trees as follows:
1. For every ten (10) on grade, open parking spaces or fraction thereof, there
shall be a minimum of one 3-inch caliper tree located within the area devoted to
on grade parking.
2. The trees required for the landscaping of on grade, open parking areas -
whether such trees are coniferous or deciduous, flowering or nonflowering -
should be tolerant to urban environmental conditions, able to screen parking
areas by virtue of their size, form, density of foliage and spread, and easy to
maintain. A suggested list of trees which meet these criteria is listed in
Subsection 11.16.4 of this Ordinance.
3. Standards of Tree Protection
a. Each tree planted in a paved area shall have minimum of fifty (50) square
feet of porous surface area surrounding the tree.
b. Trees which are planted along roadways or in parking lots shall be
protected by a curbed planter strip or by precast concrete curbs or railroad
ties or by suitably designed concrete, steel or wood bollards placed at least
four feet (4) from the tree.
20.67 Mechanical Equipment and Refuse Storage Areas.
1. No refuse storage areas nor mechanical equipment areas shall be located in a
front yard within the district. Such areas shall be screened from view from street
and parking areas, residential districts, open space areas, and designated
parkways by a six (6) foot high durable nonliving barrier (or earth berm) planted
with at least one shrub or vine for each ten (10) feet of barrier towards the abutting
property.
2. Mechanical equipment on the roof of any building shall be permanently
screened from view from the ground or other buildings in the area.
20.68 Development Consultation Procedure. The Parkway Overlay District shall be
considered an area of special planning concern. Except as modified by Subsection
20.68.1, development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 shall be subject to the
development consultation procedure.
20.68.1 Development proposals requiring a special permit or exempted under Subsections
20.63.2, 20.63.3, or 20.63.4 shall not be subjected to the development consultation
procedure.
20-25
20.68.2 Subsection 19.43.1 notwithstanding, only exterior building alterations increasing gross
floor area by one thousand (1000) square feet or more shall be subject to the
development consultation procedure.
20.68.3 Subsection 19.42.1(4) notwithstanding, only construction of ten (10) or more parking
spaces shall be subject to the development consultation procedure.
20.69 Concord Avenue Parkway Subdistrict
For the purposes of providing additional protection to a portion of Concord Avenue that
abuts the Fresh Pond Reservation and which serves as a gateway to Cambridge, this
section hereby creates a Concord Avenue Parkway Subdistrict within the Parkway
Overlay District. The subdistrict is that portion of the Parkway Overlay District along
Concord Avenue that is bounded on the west by the dividing line between the

20-30
MEMORIAL DRIVE OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.81 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Memorial Drive Overlay
District which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this
Section 20.80. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to that
area abutting Memorial Drive that lies between the Drive and the residential
neighborhoods beyond and that has a non-residential or medium to high density
residential base zoning designation.
20.82 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.80 to augment base zoning regulations in
the District in order to create a more harmonious and consistent character for the
development along Memorial Drive and where such development faces or abuts low
density neighborhood residential districts; to encourage good building design and site
development that enhances amenities available to pedestrians walking along
Memorial Drive and the Charles River waterfront; and where commercial uses and
higher density residential development abut residential neighborhoods, to ensure that
physical changes within the Overlay District are compatible with the scale and
character of the abutting neighborhoods; to encourage the retention of existing
buildings of historic value; to encourage uses that will serve needs of residents of
abutting neighborhoods or those persons enjoying the open space amenities along the
Charles River; and to discourage new development inappropriate in both scale and
design.
20.83 Applicability. The Memorial Drive Overlay District shall be an overlay district on the
zoning map established by Section 3.20.
20.83.1 The building and land uses within the Memorial Drive Overlay District shall be
regulated by the provisions of the applicable base zoning district except as modified
by the requirements of this Section 20.80, which shall apply in addition to regulations
imposed by the base zoning district designations. Where the base zoning regulations
differ from the requirements of this Section 20.80 the stricter provisions shall apply,
unless a Special Permit is issued by the Planning Board pursuant to Article 20.88.
20.84 Dimensional Standards in the Memorial Drive Overlay District
20.84.1 Maximum Height. The maximum height of any structure in the Overlay District shall
be permitted in the applicable base zoning district, except as provided below. Lots
abutting Memorial Drive may be subject to further height limitations imposed by
Chapter 91 of the Massachusetts General Laws.
20.84.2 For that portion of the Overlay District located north of the centerline of River Street
and within ninety (90) feet of Blackstone Street the maximum height shall be forty-five
(45) feet where the base district permits heights greater than thirty-five (35) feet.
20.84.3 Minimum Required Front Yard Abutting Memorial Drive. The minimum required front
yard for that portion of a lot abutting Memorial Drive shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
20.85 Restrictions in Required and/or Provided Setbacks.
20-31
20.85.1 That area between the principal wall plane of a building and a public street or public
park, whether required or provided, shall be devoted to Green Area Open Space as
defined in Article 2.000 of this Ordinance, an expansion of the adjacent public
sidewalk, a park, or other landscaped or paved area devoted exclusively to pedestrian
and bicycle use and extending along the entire length of the lot facing the street or
park. Areas devoted to vehicular use are prohibited from this area with the exception
of access drives leading directly to parking facilities located elsewhere on the site,
which drives shall be limited as follows:
1. A maximum of one two-way access drive (and curb cut) or two one-way access

setback above that of the adjacent street or park provided the setback remains
essentially at grade.
Where the lot abuts more than two streets, the provisions of this Section 20.85.1 shall
apply to no more than two streets. The two streets to which this Section shall apply
shall be determined by the street hierarchy set forth in Section 20.87.1 below.
20.85.12 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20.85.1 above or any provision of Article
6.000, any on grade open parking facility shall be set back from front lot line by at least

compatible with the residential neighborhoods in close proximity to the District. The
following standards shall apply:
20-33
1. A principal, publicly accessible building entrance shall be located on the building
façade facing the principal street the lot abuts. Where a building abuts more than
one street, a principal, publicly accessible building entrance on each street is
encouraged but only one shall be required. That entrance shall face the most
important street as determined by the following hierarchy (most important street to
the least important street): Memorial Drive, River Street, Putnam Avenue,
Pleasant Street, Magazine Street, Blackstone Street and Riverside Road. A
principal, publicly accessible entrance serving a separate ground floor
establishment shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
Nothing in this Paragraph 1 requires generally public access to a building or
facility that is customarily accessible to only the inhabitants of the building, its
guests and customers.
2. Where office and/or retail uses are accommodated on the ground floor each
separately leased space shall have an individual public entrance onto the abutting
street where any portion of the space fronts the street.
3. Facades facing a public street or a public park, designated city landmark building
or a building in a local historic district or neighborhood conservation district that is
located on an abutting lot, shall consist of a minimum twenty-five (25) percent
clear glass in total for each separate façade facing a street park or building. That
clear-glass requirement shall be increased to fifty (50) percent on the ground floor
where retail and office uses are established. However, where a retail
establishment abuts more than one street, park or building, only the façade facing
the principal street (as set forth in Paragraph 1 above) shall be required to meet
the 50% requirement.
20.88 Waiver of Certain Provisions of the Overlay District or its Base Districts
20.88.1 Divergence from the standards specified in Sections 20.86  20.87 may be allowed by
issuance of a Special Permit from the Planning Board. The Board shall grant such a
permit upon its determination that the development proposed will still serve the
objectives of this Section 20.80 and that proposed development is consistent with the
Section 19.30  Urban Design Objectives.
20.88.2 In recognition of the preservation, enhancement or creation of the Memorial Drive
Overlay District Objectives, the Planning Board may, by Special Permit, allow a
reduction in the required front yard setback, on any lot abutting Memorial Drive with an
existing building (as of July 1, 2004) exceeding one hundred and twenty (120) feet, to
a minimum of five (5) feet with the exception of Memorial Drive, where it may, by
Special Permit, allow the reduction in required minimum setback to fifteen (15) feet.
The Planning Board may also, or instead, waive the base zone height limit for any lot
abutting Memorial Drive with an existing building (as of July 1, 2004) exceeding one
hundred and twenty (120) feet, by Special Permit, allowing height up to one hundred
and twenty (120) feet.
20-34
20.89 The required yards, permitted Gross Floor Area (GFA) and permitted height for
structures in existences as of July 1, 2004 shall be those yards, GFA, or height
existing at that time and shall be deemed conforming for the purpose of applying the
nonconforming provisions of Article 8.000. Otherwise, for any other provision of the
Zoning Ordinance and for any new construction, the dimensional requirements of this
Section 20.80 and any applicable base zoning district shall apply.
20.810 Special Gross Floor Area Provisions in the Office 2 District. In order to facilitate the
rehabilitation of the parkway character of Memorial Drive within the Overlay District,
additional Gross Floor Area for residential uses (Section 4.31, Paragraphs a-h) shall
be permitted. That additional Gross Floor Area shall be above the Floor Area Ratio
limit otherwise set in the applicable base zoning district, subject to the issuance of a
Special Permit from the Planning Board and subject to the following conditions and
limitations. The additional floor area is intended as an incentive to encourage the
construction of additional housing to replace existing automobile-oriented retail uses
and site improvements abutting the Drive or the residential neighborhood edge, which
have produced an unsightly environment of parking lots, parking garages, driveways,
garish signs and featureless facades.
a. These provisions shall only apply to a lot, abutting Memorial Drive, in existence as
of July 1, 2004.
b. Up to a maximum of fifty thousand (50,000) square feet of additional GFA shall be
permitted subject to the following limitations:
i. Where development on the lot is at, or exceeds, the maximum GFA
permitted on the lot as determined by the existing mix of uses on the
lots and the applicable base zoning district regulations (exclusive of any
bonus GFA permitted in Section 11.200) as of July 1, 2004, a total of
fifty thousand (50,000) square feet shall be permitted for additional
residential development.
ii. Where additional GFA is available on the lot under the provisions of the
applicable base zoning district (exclusive of any bonus GFA permitted in
Section 11.200) as of July 1, 2004, only that portion of the fifty thousand
(50,000) square feet that exceeds the GFA otherwise available on the
lot (exclusive of any bonus GFA permitted in Section 11.200) shall be
permitted.
c. The new residential construction shall conform to the Overlay District and any
applicable base district regulations with the exception of the GFA limitations
imposed in the applicable base zoning district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of computing lot area per dwelling unit, the provisions of Article 5.14
shall not apply.
d. In granting the Special Permit the Planning Board shall find that the additional
GFA proposed can be reasonably accommodated on the site without significant
negative traffic, environmental or other similar impacts while at the same time
20-35
significantly improving the impact of all development on the site, particularly along
Memorial Drive and the residential neighborhood edge.
Among the visual and urban design improvements demonstrating such
improvement are:
i. The elimination of curb cuts on Memorial Drive;
ii. The provisions of landscaping in lieu of parking, driveway and other
vehicular paving between the buildings on the site an Memorial Drive or
the abutting neighborhood edge;
iii. The elimination of visually intrusive auto-oriented uses such as gas
stations etc.
iv. The introduction of building facades that relate positively to the Drive or
the abutting neighborhood with ample amounts of glass, places of
pedestrian entry etc.
v. The screening of automobile-oriented areas, such as parking garages,
with active uses.
20.811 The Memorial Drive Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning
concern subject to the provisions of section 19.40.
20.90 ALEWIFE OVERLAY DISTRICTS 1-6
20.91 Establishment and Scope. There are hereby established six Alewife Overlay Districts,
which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this Section
20.90. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to the area at
Alewife that has historically developed as a retail and industrial area generally at
rather low densities, but which can be expected to develop more extensively and in
greater variety of uses in the future.
20.91.1 The Alewife Overlay Districts shall be a series of Overlay Districts established on the
Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. Provisions of this Section 20.90
and all references to it in this Zoning Ordinance shall apply equally to each of the six
Overlay districts except as set forth below.
20.92 General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.90 to augment existing base
district zoning regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for
change in the Alewife area. The regulations contained in this Section 20.90 provide for
more careful public scrutiny of future development proposals and provide an
opportunity to shape the form and character of that development in ways that will
benefit both individual property owners and the general interests of the larger
commercial and residential neighborhood as a whole.
These regulations are intended to harness the opportunities presented with the
redevelopment of private property in ways that will:
20-36
1. Encourage forms of development, mix of uses, and range of improvements
that will facilitate and encourage walking, biking and transit use and reduce the
growth of auto trips in an area already burdened with regional vehicular traffic
passing through to other destinations in the metropolitan region;
2. Preserve and enhance the capacity to store floodwater, recharge groundwater
and manage the collection and disposal of stormwater in ways that add to the
quality and visual appeal of the built environment as well as to the quality of the
water itself;
3. Minimize the negative impact of new development on the adjacent Cambridge
Highlands residential neighborhood while introducing new amenities and services
that will benefit the residents of that neighborhood;
4. Integrate the entire area through the creation of new pedestrian paths,
roadways, green spaces and bridges that will facilitate movement within the
several Districts and beyond to the Cambridge Highlands, North Cambridge and
Neighborhood Nine neighborhoods and the Fresh Pond Reservation;
5. Introduce a significant component of residential living and support retail
services to enhance the areas appeal for all persons who come to work, shop as
well as live within the Districts; and
6. Create an identity and sense of place for the Alewife Districts that parallels the
development of the historic urban centers that characterize much of Cambridge.
20.93 General Provisions
20.93.1 The Alewife Overlay Districts shall be considered areas of special planning concern.

20.93.2 Criteria for Development Consultation Review and Review of Applications for Special
Permits and Variances.
In reviewing applications for variances, special permits or development consultation
reviews the permit or special permit granting authority shall be guided by the
objectives, criteria, and guidelines contained in the publication Concord-Alewife Plan
in addition to the requirements of Sections 10.30 (Variances) and 10.40 (Special
Permits) and this Section 20.90. These guidelines are also intended to assist in
shaping any contemplated physical change within the Alewife Overlay Districts. With
respect to consistency with the Concord-Alewife Plan, special emphasis shall be
placed on preservation of key rights-of-way for infrastructure projects as indicated in
the Priority Infrastructure Plan.
20.93.3 Applicability. Buildings and uses within the Alewife Overlay Districts shall be controlled
by the pertinent regulations within the applicable base districts, except as modified by

railroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northeast District or that portion of
the Quadrangle Southeast District within 300 feet of the railroad right of way and
the Triangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a buildings
design that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian
connection, as well as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the
necessary fee or easement property interests in land that would permit access to
such a connection. In this instance the additional FAR, available for any use,
shall be 0.25 applied to the entire lot that is the subject of the special permit.
2. Conveyance of fee or easement property interests to the City of Cambridge
(in a form acceptable to the City) to permit the future construction of roadway

recreation features consistent with the Concord-Alewife Plan, which segment,
20-39
path, park or open space is identified on the maps entitled Priority Infrastructure
Plan and Additional Infrastructure Plan or is otherwise identified by the Planning
Board at another location and determined by the Board to be of equal value and
consistent with those elements identified on the Map and the objectives set forth
in the Plan.
In this instance, the additional FAR shall be equal to the FAR otherwise permitted

3.The Planning Board shall consider the following in making its findings:
a. The objectives of the Concord-Alewife Plan continue to be met.
b. The stormwater management objectives for the area continue to be
met both on the site and as the site may be a part of a larger system
for managing stormwater runoff.
c. The reduction or waiver of yard requirements provides for more
efficient development of land; encourages or facilitates a more logical
pattern of buildings, streets, parks and open space; or enhances the
urban, pedestrian character of the area as envisioned in the Concord-
Alewife Plan.
20.95.4 Dwelling Unit Density. In any instance where the required Minimum Lot Area Per
Dwelling Unit in any base district is greater than 600 square feet the Planning Board
may issue a special permit to reduce the required Minimum Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit
to 600 square feet.
In any instance where additional Gross Floor Area is permitted on a lot as provided for
in Section 20.95.11, or Transfer of Development Rights, Section 21.40, the Planning
Board may allow additional dwelling units on the lot at the rate of one dwelling unit for
each 1,000 square feet of additional Gross floor Area.
20.96 At Grade Open Space and Permeable Area Requirements. Each lot shall be required
to provide open space located at grade in the quantities set forth below. That open
space may be any combination of Green Area, Permeable, Public, Publicly Beneficial,
or Private open space as defined in Article 2.000.
In addition, each lot shall provide Permeable Area in quantities set forth below.
Permeable Area shall be defined as that at-grade surface of a lot that is fully
permeable to the infiltration of water to the soil below and whose subsurface permits
the percolation of such surface water to the groundwater without interruption or
diversion by any building, pavement, structure, or other manmade element with the
exception of incidental utilities.
Nothing in these requirements shall prohibit the same portion of a lot from meeting
both the Open Space and the Permeable Area requirements of this Section 20.96
20.96.1 Quantity. The minimum ratio of Open Space and Permeable Area to the total area of
the lot shall be fifteen (15) percent for Open Space and twenty-five (25) percent for
Permeable Area. The Permeable Area requirement may be reduced as of right with
the certification to the Superintendent by the City Engineer that the lot and the
development upon it meet the Department of Public Works standards for water quality
management and the retention/detention of the difference between the 2-year 24-hour
pre-construction runoff hydrograph and the post-construction 25-year 24-hour runoff
hydrograph as outlined in the publication Proposed Concord  Alewife Area
Stormwater Management Guidelines, May 2006, Cambridge Department of Public
Works, and upon a finding by the Planning Board pursuant to its review of an
20-43
application under the provisions of Section 20.93.2, that such reduction advances the
relevant purposes of this Section.
20.96 .2 Pooled Open Space and Permeable Area Requirement.
In order to provide the flexibility to advance the policy objectives of the Concord-
Alewife Plan to create a system of parks and pathways throughout the Area, facilitate
the storage and management of stormwater runoff, encourage the development of
land management practices that facilitate and encourage the recharging of the areas
groundwater, and allow multiple owners to cooperate in advancing these objectives to
their benefit as well as to the benefit of the general public, the Planning Board may
permit by special permit the pooling of Open Space and Permeable Area requirements
for one lot on other adjacent or non-contiguous lots, subject to the following
requirements:
1. There is no reduction in the total area of required Open Space or Permeable
Area unless such reduction is permitted by the Planning Board under the
provisions of Section 20.96.3 below.
2. The relocated Open Space or Permeable Area continues to serve, or better
serve, the policy objectives of the Concord-Alewife Plan.
3. More useful and better located open space and water management facilities are
created, which may, in turn, permit better designed and coordinated development
on the affected lots.
20.96 .3 Reduction in Required Open Space. The Planning Board may allow by Special Permit
the reduction of required Open Space, or permit such Open Space to be located other
than at grade if the applicant can demonstrate that the urban design and stormwater
management objectives as set forth in the Concord-Alewife Plan continue to be met,
as for example through the use of innovative stormwater management techniques like
green roofs.
20.97 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the Alewife Overlay Districts
shall conform to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article
6.000 for the applicable base zoning district, except as modified below.
20.97.1 Setbacks Applied to At-grade Open Parking Facilities. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 20.95.32 above or any provision of Article 6.000, any on grade open
parking facility shall be set back from the front lot line by at least ten feet. Such
setback shall be landscaped as required in Section 20.95.32, Paragraph 1 above.
20.97.2 Pooled Parking. In order to provide the flexibility to advance the policy objectives of
the Concord-Alewife Plan through the creation of more pedestrian friendly
development throughout the area, to permit greater permeable land surface to be
established, to facilitate environments with greater landscaping and green area
including parks and recreation areas, to more efficiently use the supply of parking
available in a district where greater use of non-auto forms of transportation are
encouraged and less land area devoted to parking use is desired, the Planning Board
may, by special permit, allow accessory parking serving one or more lots to be located
in whole or in part in pooled parking facilities, or a public parking facility, located
anywhere within the Alewife Overlay Districts, notwithstanding the limitations set forth
in Section 6.22.1. In granting such a special permit the Planning Board shall consider
the following:
20-44
1. The facility advances the objective of the Concord-Alewife Plan.
2. A shared facility is established that aids in implementation of effective
Transportation Demand Management measures to reduce dependence on the
single occupancy automobile.
3. The facility is appropriately located to serve the development it serves.
4. The facility is well designed, does not diminish the pedestrianfriendly quality
the area around it, and is otherwise consistent with the urban design objective of
the Concord-Alewife Plan.
20.97.3 Waiver of Gross Floor Area Provisions for Parking Facilities  Section 5.25. Because
of the unique factors related to flooding and groundwater management in Alewife, the
importance of maintaining a high level of permeability, and the difficulty of constructing
large areas of building below grade, the Planning Board may by special permit exempt
the Gross Floor Area contained in any above ground structured parking facility from
the FAR limitations established in this Section 20.90 and any applicable base zoning
(such special permit shall supercede the provisions of Section 5.25.42 for any lot
within the Alewife Overlay Districts). In granting such a special permit the Planning
Board shall consider the following:
1. The facility advances the objective of the Concord-Alewife Plan.
2. A shared facility is established that aids in implementation of effective
Transportation Demand Management measures to reduce dependence on the
single occupancy automobile.
3. The facility is well designed, does not diminish the pedestrian friendly quality
the area around it, and is otherwise consistent with the urban design objective of
the Concord-Alewife Plan
4. The additional bulk of building above grade is well designed and does not
have an unreasonably negative impact on its abutters or the public realm.
5. The extent to which the construction of an above grade parking structure
facilitates the creation of at grade soil permeability.
20.97.4 Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements.
Any development seeking one or more special permits allowed in this Section 20.90
shall be subject to the minimum and maximum parking requirements and loading
requirements set forth in Column 3 of Section 6.36  Schedule of Parking and Loading
Requirements.
20.98 Transfer of Development Rights. The transfer of permitted GFA from a Donating Lot
to a Receiving Lot shall be permitted in the Alewife Overlay Districts 1-6, subject to the
provisions of Section 21.40 and the dimensional and use provisions of the applicable
base zoning districts, as modified by the provisions of Alewife Overlay Districts as set
forth in the Section 20.90.
20.99 Subdivision of Lots. Where it is proposed to subdivide a lot (after approval by special
permit has been granted by the Planning Board for development on that lot) in order to
convey to the City of Cambridge an easement or fee interest in property for the
purpose of creation of a city or private street, a pedestrian pathway, a pedestrian
bridge, bicycle path, open space or park, (or otherwise provided by others as a
condition of the issuance of the special permit), such subdivision shall be permitted,
notwithstanding any definition of lot or street in this Ordinance or any limitation in
applicable base or overlay districts with regard to minimum lot size, required yards or
other dimensional, open space or other regulatory requirement or limitation. All
dimensional requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and this Section 20.90 shall be
20-45
satisfied by the lot as a whole as defined in the application for a special permit and
shall be waived with regard to any subsequent subdivided lots.
No development approved by special permit in this Section 20.90 shall be
subsequently rendered non-conforming with regard to the dimensional requirements
applicable to it as a result of a subdivision of land to create an approved public or
private street, park or pedestrian, bicycle or other pathway.
20.910 Special Provisions Related to Local Government Uses  Section 4.33 (f).
Notwithstanding any provisions of the applicable base district regulations or any
provision of this Section 20.90, all uses set forth in Section 4.33 (f) shall be permitted
as of right in Overlay Districts 1-4, subject to the following as-of-right dimensional and
other requirements.

shall be fifteen (15) percent and shall consist of any combination of Green Area,
Permeable, Public, Publicly beneficial or Private open space. The Open Space shall
be located at grade.
20.910.5 Permeable Area Requirement. There shall be no Permeable Area requirement
provided the City Engineer certifies to the Superintendent of Buildings that the
development meets the Department of Public Works standards for water quality
management and the retention/detention of the difference between the 2-year 24-hour
pre-construction runoff hydrograph and the post-construction 25-year 24-hour runoff
hydrograph.
20.910.6 The provisions of Section 19.20 and 19.50 shall not apply to these uses.
20.910.6 Other Requirements. All other requirements and procedures of this Section 20.90 and
the applicable base zoning district shall continue to apply.
20.920 Special Provisions Related to Lots of 5,000 Square Feet or Less. Notwithstanding any
provision of the applicable base district regulations or any provision of this Section
20.90, for lots of 5,000 square feet or less in existence as of January 1, 2005 and held
in separate ownership from any abutting lot, the following dimensional standards shall

20.100 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.101 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Massachusetts Avenue
Overlay District which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified
in this Section 20.100. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to
the area described generally as Northern Massachusetts Avenue and certain abutting
portions of the neighborhood abutting it.
20.102 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.100 to augment base zoning regulations
in the District in order (a) to protect and promote the retail and service ecosystem
along the Avenue, (b) to create a more harmonious and consistent image for the
development along the Avenue and adjacent areas, to encourage good building
design and site development which enhances the pedestrian amenities along the
Avenue, (c) to ensure that changes along the Avenue are compatible with the scale
and character of the abutting neighborhoods, (d) to encourage the retention of existing
buildings of historic value and uses which serve the abutting neighborhoods, and to (e)
discourage new development inappropriate in both scale and design.
20.103 Applicability. The Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District shall be an overlay district
on the zoning map established by Section 3.20.
20.103.1 The buildings and land uses within said district shall be controlled by the pertinent
regulations within the base zoning district, except as modified by the requirements of
this Section 20.100 which shall apply in addition to regulations imposed by the base
20-47
zoning map designations. Where the base zoning regulations differ from the
requirements of this Section 20.100 the stricter provisions shall apply except where a
waiver from those requirements is granted by special permit from the Planning Board
under any of the provisions of this Section 20.100.
20.103.2 deleted #1385
20.104 Dimensional Standards in the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District.

sixty (60) feet or the height applicable in the base district, whichever is less.
20.104.2 Modifications to the Definition of Gross Floor Area. Notwithstanding the definition of
Gross Floor Area contained in Article 2.000 - Definitions, the following shall not be
included as part of the gross floor area of any building in the Overlay District:
1. Enclosed bays and other small projections from the principal wall plane of a
building normally included as gross floor area, provided they are three (3) feet or
less in depth and further provided that the following conditions are met:
a. The maximum width of the projection does not exceed six (6) feet in
length;
b. No more than fifty (50) percent of the area of each principal wall plane is
covered with such projections.
20.104.3 Additional Dimensional Standards for Lots Located in both a Business C zoning district
and an abutting Residence C-1 or Residence B Zoning District
The provisions of this Section 20.104.3 shall apply to lots held in single ownership as of
June 1, 2008 that are located entirely within the Overlay District and shall be granted
after the issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board
1 . Modification of the Transitional Requirements of Section 5.40. The Planning
Board may waive the Front and Side Yard and Height requirements of Section
5.40 for Hotel or Motel Use provided the Board finds that the intended buffering
provided by the provisions of Section 5.40 is reasonably provided through other
means. The Board shall specifically find the following:
a. The lot contains a contiguous area that is within the adjoining residential
district.
b. The portion of the lot in the residential district is substantially dedicated to
at grade Green Area, Permeable, or Publically Beneficial Open Space as
defined in Article 2.000.
c. The portion of the lot dedicated to Open Space provides an adequate
transition buffer between any structure constructed in the commercially
zoned portion of the lot and adjacent residential uses in the residential
district. Such Open Space shall have a minimum depth of twenty (20) feet.
2. Modification of the FAR limitations for a Hotel or Motel Use (Sections 5.30 and
5.33), for a lot located in both a Business C and a Residence B Zoning District.
The Planning Board may allow a FAR of 1.60, calculated on the area of the entire
lot, in both the Business C and Residence B districts, subject to the following
conditions and limitations:
a. All of the resulting Gross Floor Area will be located on the Business C
20-48
portion of the lot.
b. All parking required by this ordinance will be located in a below-grade
parking facility.
c. The at-grade portion of the lot within the Residence B District is
substantially dedicated to Green Area, Permeable, or Publically Beneficial
Open Space as defined in Article 2.000.
d. The additional FAR of 1.60 shall only apply to the first 15,000 square feet
of a lot. For portions of the lot greater than 15, 000 square feet the FAR
permitted in the applicable base Business C and residential districts shall
continue to apply.
e. No preferably preserved significant building, as determined by the
Cambridge Historical Commission, is demolished, as set forth in the City of
Cambridge Demolition Ordinance #965.
20.105 Restrictions in Required and/or Provided Setbacks. That area between the principal
wall plane of a building and a public street or public park whether required or provided
shall be devoted to Green Area Open Space as defined in Article 2.000 of this
Ordinance, an expansion of the adjacent public sidewalk, park, or other landscaped or
paved area devoted exclusively to pedestrian use and extending along the entire
length of the lot facing the street or park. Areas devoted to vehicular use are
prohibited from this area with the exception of access drives to parking facilities
located elsewhere on the site and which shall be limited to a total of thirty (30) feet of
width for each one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage.
The required Green Area Open Space, landscaping or other paved area devoted to
pedestrian uses shall be located at the mean grade of the relevant public street or
open space at the property line unless an exception is granted under the provisions of
Section 20.108 of this Section 20.100.
20.106 Use Restrictions. The ground (first) floor of that portion of a building facing a public
street or public park shall consist of Gross Floor Area devoted to any one or
combination of the following uses: Residential (Section 4.31), Office (Section 4.34),
retail business (Section 4.35), Institutional (Section 4.33) meeting the following
conditions:
1. At least eighty (80) percent of the floor elevation of the ground (first) floor shall
be no higher than the four (4) feet above the mean grade of the adjacent public
sidewalk or public park, at the property line, except that Retail Business uses in
new construction shall be located at mean grade;
2. The use shall have a depth of at least twenty (20) feet;
3. Where a lot fronts on two streets the provisions of this Section 11.106 shall
apply only to the principal arterial street frontage provided the remainder of the
ground floor of the building facing the public street shall be screened with a
permanent wall in materials equal in quality to those of the rest of the building
and having a minimum opacity of fifty (50) percent.
20-49
4. The ground (first floor use of any building, to a minimum depth of forty (40) feet
from the ground floor building facade fronting the principal arterial street, shall not
include areas of parking facilities in a structure that is not underground according
to the standards and definitions set forth in Section 5.25 of this Zoning
Ordinance. Without limitation, in accordance with Section 5.25, this exclusion
shall apply to parking spaces and vehicular access drives that are either fully
enclosed within the building, or covered by a structure above while remaining
open on the sides. Access drives that are open to the sky are permitted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 20.105 above. North of Porter
Square, one parking space for each unit in a Townhouse shall be exempt from
the limitations of this Section 20.106.
20.106. 1 Accessory Parking and Vehicular Access for Hotel Use. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Table 4.30 and Section 6.22,, for a lot located in both a Business C and a
Residence B zoning district, the Planning Board may grant a Special Permit to allow
accessory Hotel or Motel Use parking within the Residence B District, including
vehicular access to the parking facility and loading facility, with the following limitations
and conditions:
1. The portion of the lot in the Residence B district is contiguous to the portion of
the lot in the BC District.
2. The parking is located in a below-grade parking structure.
3. The at-grade portion of the lot within the Residence B district is substantially
dedicated to Green Area, Permeable, or Publically Beneficial Open Space as
defined in this Ordinance.
20.107 Design Standards
20.107.1 Building Facades. Building facades shall be designed to enhance the visual quality of
the Overlay District, create an environment pleasant and inviting for the pedestrian
and compatible with the residential neighborhoods in close proximity to the district.
The following standards shall apply:
1. Principal building entrances shall face Massachusetts Avenue where a lot
abuts the Avenue;
2. Where office and/or retail uses are accommodated on the ground floor each
separately leased space shall have an individual public entrance onto the
abutting street where any portion of the space fronts towards the street;
3. Facades facing a public street, a public park, or designated city landmark
building, or building in a local historic district or neighborhood conservation
district, on an abutting lot, shall consist of a minimum twenty-five (25) percent
clear glass in total for the facade, with clear glass increased to fifty (50) percent
on the ground floor where retail and office uses are established. The maximum
amount of clear glass permitted shall be seventy-five (75) percent of the facade.
Reflective and opaque glass shall be prohibited.
20-50
20.108 Divergence from the standards specified in Sections 20.105 - 20.107 may be allowed
by issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board. The Board shall grant such
a permit upon its determination that the development proposed will better serve the
objectives of this Section 20.100 than if the standards were followed and that the
criteria specified in Section 10.43 will be satisfied.
The Board shall be guided in its determination by Northern Massachusetts Avenue
Urban Design Guidelines and other such guidelines as may be established for this
portion of Massachusetts Avenue. This Section 20.108 is intended for variations from
the standards which may be appropriate in specific locations and circumstances and
where careful design detail is a controlling factor.
20.109 Nonconforming structures. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.23, that
portion of a legal, nonconforming structure lying within the Massachusetts Avenue
Overlay District which is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, or other catastrophe
may be rebuilt or restored and used again, in the same way as it had been legally
used immediately before the damage, without limit as to cost of such rebuilding or
restoring provided the following conditions are met:
1. Any restoration or rebuilding shall commence within twelve (12) months after
the catastrophe;
2. The structure shall be restored or rebuilt to the same design, including
materials and design details as existed previously; or should the restoration not
be feasible necessitating that the structure be rebuilt to a different design, said
design shall be at least equal to the original design of the structure in quality of
materials used, the quantity and quality of design details employed, and the
compatibility of the site design with abutting properties;
3. The Community Development Department shall certify to the Superintendent
of Buildings that the above conditions have been met.
With respect to the comparability of newly designed buildings, the Community
Development Department shall consult the Cambridge Historical Commission for
structures greater than fifty (50) years old. Should the Community Development
Department find that said conditions have not been met the restoring or
rebuilding shall require a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal.
The restored or rebuilt structure shall in no aspect increase the nonconforming
nature of the original structure; nothing in this Section 20.110, however, shall
prohibit a rebuilding or restoring which reduces the nonconforming nature of the
original structure.
20.110 Additional Standards Applicable in the Business A-2 Districts. Within the portions of
the Overlay District having a base Business A-2 zoning district designation (the BA-2
Districts) the regulations set forth above in Subsections 20.103 to 20.109 shall apply
except as modified by this Section 20.110. However, the provisions of this Section
20.110 shall not apply in the portion of the BA-2 District north of the centerline of
Richard Avenue.
20-51
20.110.1 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District shall
apply equally within the included BA-2 Districts. The intent of the additional standards
applicable in the BA-2 Districts is to encourage the retention and expansion of
pedestrian-friendly ground floor retail and other active non-residential uses on the
ground floors of buildings along the Avenue. Additionally, as sites are redeveloped in
the future, new buildings and streetscapes should have a scale, urban design, and mix
of uses that strengthens the urban character of the Avenue as the principal
commercial corridor serving the North Cambridge, Agassiz and Neighborhood Nine
neighborhoods while also respecting the historic characteristics of the Avenue.
20.110.2 Use Regulations. In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 20.106, the
following regulations shall apply.
20.110.21 Required Ground Floor Non-Residential Uses. The ground floor of any building that
fronts directly onto Massachusetts Avenue shall consist of at least one (1) active nonresidential
use meeting the following requirements:
1. Range of Qualifying Uses. The required ground floor active non-residential uses
shall be limited to one or a combination of the following uses, to the extent
permitted in the base zoning district:
a. Section 4.34 a (office of a physician, dentist or other medical practitioner not
located in a clinic listed under subsection 4.33(d)), b (office of an accountant,
attorney, or other non-medical professional person (includes properly
licensed massage therapists), c (real estate, insurance or other agency
office), d (general office use), e (bank, trust company or similar financial

2. Minimum Depth. The required ground floor uses shall have a minimum depth of
forty (40) feet measured from the Massachusetts Avenue frontage of the building
(or the full depth of the building if less than forty (40) feet).
20-52
3. Floor Elevation. The floor elevation of the required ground floor uses shall be at
the mean grade of the adjacent public sidewalk.
4. Minimum Linear Frontage. The required ground floor non-residential use shall
occupy a minimum of 75% of the linear frontage of the building facing
Massachusetts Avenue.
5. Individual Store Size.
a. In portions of the included BA-2 Districts north of Porter Square, any separately
leased required ground floor non-residential use shall contain no more than
5,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area, which calculation of square footage shall
include any floor area located below grade.
b. In portions of the included BA-2 Districts south of Porter Square, any separately
leased required ground floor non-residential use shall contain no more than
2,500 squre feet of Gross Floor Area, which calculation of square footage shall
exclude any floor area located below grade. However, the Planning Board may
grant modifications to such Gross Floor Area limitation, pursuant to Section
20.110.22 below, to accommodate a pre-existing non-residential use of building
or for other reasons that are in support of the non-residential use purposes of the
Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District.
6. Minimum Ground Floor Height. For any ground floor portion of a building
containing a required non-residential use the minimum ground floor height shall be
fifteen (15) feet measured in the manner described in Paragraph 20.110.42. If the
ground floor height is reduced below fifteen (15) feet by special permit or variance,
there shall be a commensurate reduction in the total height of the building.
7. Maximum Bank Frontage. No bank, trust company or similar financial institution
may occupy a building frontage of more than twenty-five (25) feet.
20.110.22 Modifications to Standards. As set forth below, the Planning Board may grant a special
permit to waive certain requirements of Subsection 20.110.21 above. A project
receiving a special permit pursuant to this Subsection 20.110.22 shall be considered
to meet the requirements of Subsection 20.110.21 for the purpose of applying the
other provisions of this Section 20.110.
1. Modifications to the Dimensional Provisions of Subsection 20.110.21
The Planning Board may approve modifications to the dimensional requirements
set forth in Subsection 20.110.21 Paragraphs (2-7) upon making a determination
that (a) the proposed modified dimensions do not substantially derogate from the
intent of the requirement to provide for a reasonably continuous active ground
floor frontage along the public street and (b) the overall floor area of required
active non-residential ground floor uses is not substantially reduced and (c) the
modifications are the minimum necessary to reasonably accommodate the new
construction or use on the lot.
20-53
2. Additional Non-Residential Uses Not Otherwise Permitted in Subsection
20.110.21
The Planning Board may approve active non-residential ground floor uses not
specifically listed in Subsection 20.110.21 Paragraph (1), to the extent permitted in
the base zoning district, upon making a determination that an alternate ground
floor use will provide services or amenities to the general public and will promote
an active, pedestrian-friendly street front consistent with the objectives of this
Overlay District and the purpose of the standards applicable in the BA-2 Districts.
20.110.23 In general, it shall not be allowed to construct a new building directly fronting
Massachusetts Avenue that cannot meet either the requirements of Section 20.110.21
or the standards by which modifications to that section are permitted by special permit
as set forth in Section 20.110.22.
However, the Planning Board may grant a special permit to waive the requirements of
Section 20.110.21 to allow the construction of a building substantially or completely
devoted to residential or dormitory uses provided the Board determines that all of the
following conditions and requirements are met:
(a) the existing site does not currently contain active non-residential uses as listed in
Subsection 20.110.21 Paragraph (1), and has not contained such uses within the
past five (5) years prior to applying for a special permit;
(b) the provision of active non-residential ground floor uses would be detrimental to
abutting properties or to the neighborhood character; and
(c) active non-residential ground floor uses would not be commercially viable at that
specific location.
A project that has been exempted from the requirements of Subsection 20.110.21 by
special permit as set forth in this Subsection 20.110.23 or by variance shall not be
considered to meet the requirements of Subsection 20.110.21 for the purpose of
applying the other provisions of this Section 20.110.
20.110.3 Dimensional Regulations
20.110.31 FAR. Notwithstanding the general applicability standards set forth in Subsection
20.103.1, the following Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limitations shall apply in place of those
set forth in the base zoning district or elsewhere in the Overlay District to the portions
of a lot contained within the BA-2 Districts, provided that such lot has direct frontage
onto Massachusetts Avenue. For a lot with no direct frontage onto Massachusetts
Avenue, and for portions of a lot that are not contained within the BA-2 Districts, the
FAR requirements generally applicable in the base district or elsewhere in the Overlay
District shall apply.
1. Mixed Use Lots. The maximum allowed FAR shall be 1.75 for any lot that consists
entirely of residential or dormitory uses, as listed in Subsections 4.31 (a-h) and
20-54
paragraph 4.33(b)(7), above the ground floor and includes ground floor active nonresidential
uses meeting the requirements of Subsection 20.110.21.
2. Other Lots. The maximum allowed FAR shall be 1.0 for any lot that does not meet
the definition of a Mixed Use Lot as set forth in Paragraph (1) above. This shall
include any lot that is predominantly non-residential in use or any lot that is
predominantly residential or dormitory in use but does not meet the requirements
of Subsection 20.110.21, and shall specifically include any lot for which a waiver
has been granted as set forth in Subsection 20.110.23.
20.110.32 Basement Gross Floor Area Exemption. Notwithstanding any provision of the
applicable base zoning district, in the BA-2 Districts the Gross Floor Area of any
basement space directly accessed through and serving a ground floor establishment
of any mixed use building facing Massachusetts Avenue shall be exempt from the
calculation of FAR on a Mixed Use Lot as set forth in Section 20.110.31 above.
20.110.33 Floor Area Waiver for Enclosed Bays and Projections. The following provisions shall
apply in place of the provisions set forth in Subsection 20.104.2. Notwithstanding the
definition of Gross Floor Area contained in Article 2.000  Definitions, the floor area
contained within enclosed bays and other small projections from the principal wall
plane of a building, including projections and bays carried to the ground, normally
defined as Gross Floor Area, shall be exempted from the calculation of GFA and FAR
on a lot, provided all of the following standards are met:
1. The exempted bays and projections must not extend more than three and a half
(3.5) feet from the principal exterior wall plane of the building, and no individual
bay or projection may exceed twelve (12) feet in width.
2. No more than fifty (50) percent of the area of each principal wall plane may be
covered with such projections.
20.110.34 Maximum Height. Generally, the maximum height of any structure shall be the height
applicable in the base district. However, notwithstanding the base district regulations
and notwithstanding the general applicability standards set forth in 20.103.1, to the
extent that the height of the ground floor non-residential space exceed ten (10) feet as
measured in the manner described in Paragraph 20.110.42 below, the maximum
height may be increased to fifty (50) feet in the included BA-2 Districts for any mixed
use building with direct frontage onto Massachusetts Avenue and located on a Mixed
Use Lot as set forth in Section 20.110.31 above. Additionally, the portion of such a
mixed use building that faces Massachusetts Avenue shall be exempt from the bulk
control plane requirements of Footnote 5.33(k) in the Table of Dimensional
Requirements; however, the provisions of Footnote 5.33(k) shall nonetheless apply to
rear portions of a building within 50 feet of a residential zoning district line.
20.110.35 Restrictions in Required and/or Provided Setbacks. The requirements set forth in
Section 20.105 shall apply. However, where a building fronts on more than two
streets, the provisions of Section 20.105 shall apply on only two streets. In any case,
20-55
where a building fronts Massachusetts Avenue, the provisions of Section 20.105 shall
apply to the Massachusetts Avenue frontage.
20.110.36 Required Front Yards. In the BA-2 District south of Arlington Street, notwithstanding
the provisions of footnote (m) in Section 5.33, Paragraph 2 of this Zoning Ordinance, a
five-foot front yard setback shall be required in all instances unless the Planning Board
reduces or waives the requirement upon granting a special permit. Such special
permit may be granted if the Planning Board finds, that considering the size of the
sidewalk and the setbacks of the abutting buildings, a reduction or waiver of the
regiment would support the purpose and objectives of the Massachusetts Avenue
Overlay District.
20.110.4 Design Standards. Buildings shall conform to the requirements set forth in Section
20.107, except as modified below.
20.110.41 Building Facades. The requirements for public entrances and clear glass set forth in
Subsection 20.107.1 Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply to any ground-floor nonresidential
use, including those uses required by Subsection 20.110.21. Required
clear glass on the ground floor façade shall be distributed on the façade such that at
least seventy-five (75) percent of the required glass is located below the midpoint
between the finished floor and the underside of the joists above.
20.110.42 Measurement of Building Facades. For purposes of this Section 20.110, where
reference is made to the area of the façade of any given floor, the vertical dimension
of that floor shall be measured from the finished interior floor to the underside of the
structural joists of the floor above. The horizontal dimension shall be measured to the
centerline of the demising wall of a separately leased space, or to the exterior wall of
the building, as applicable. Where reference is made to the entire façade, the vertical
dimension shall be measured from the mean grade of the façade facing the street (or
other feature) to the underside of the structural rafters supporting the roof.
20.110.5 Parking Exemption for Seasonal Outdoor Seating. Notwithstanding any provision of
the applicable base zoning district, seasonal, temporary outdoor seating available for
any length of time between April 15 and October 31 shall be exempt from the parking
requirements of Section 6.36.5 (e) and (f) for any retail use listed in Section 6.36.5 (e)
or (f), provided that the total number of seasonal seats does not exceed fifty (50) or
fifty percent of the total number of permanent seats provided at the establishment,
whichever is less.
20.110.6 Existing and Historic Structures
20.111.61 The building design standards and conditions set forth in Section 20.106 Paragraphs
(1) and (2), Section 20.107, and Subsection 20.110.21 Paragraphs (2), (3) and (6)
shall not apply to any building constructed before April 5, 2012. However, a building
constructed before April 5, 2012, which in whole or in part meets the requirements of
this Section 20.100, shall not be altered so as to increase the degree to which it does
not comply with this Section 20.100.
20-56
20.110.62 Any lot containing a historic structure as listed below, or as may be designated a
Preferably Preserved Significant building by the Cambridge Historical Commission,
shall be exempt from the requirements of 20.110.21. If the applicable requirements of
Section 20.110.21 are not met, the lot shall not be considered a Mixed Use Lot under
the provisions of Subsection 20.110.31 above. However, notwithstanding any other
provisions of Subsection 20.110.31, the Planning Board may grant a special permit to
increase the allowed FAR in the BA-2 Districts, but not to exceed 1.75, for any
combination of permitted uses upon finding that the increased FAR would (a) facilitate
the preservation of the historic structure through economic reuse, (b) preserve the
essential historically significant elements of the structures architecture and setting, (c)
introduce uses that are respectful of the structures historic character, and (d) advance
the stated purpose of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District and the purpose of
the standards applicable in the BA-2 Districts.
Lots Containing Identified Historic Structures. The following street address numbers
on Massachusetts Avenue shall designate lots containing historic structures for the
purpose of this Subsection 20.110.62: 1675, 1676, 1679, 1684,1686, 1696, 1705,

planning concern. Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 19.43.1  Applicability of
Large Project Review Procedure, in the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District the
Large Project Review Procedure shall apply to any development proposal containing
more than two thousand (2,000) square feet of Gross Floor Area but less than fifty
thousand (50,000) square feet, unless such development is exempt by virtue of the
provisions of Section 19.45.
20.200 PROSPECT STREET OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.201 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Prospect Street Overlay
District which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this
Section 20.200. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to a
single area described generally as Prospect Street and certain abutting portions of the
neighborhood around it.
20.202 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.200 to augment base zoning regulations
in the District in order to create a more harmonious and consistent image for the area
along Prospect Street and adjacent areas, to encourage good building design and site
development which enhances the pedestrian amenities along the street, to ensure that
20-57
future development and redevelopment is compatible with the character of the abutting
neighborhoods, to encourage the retention of existing buildings of historic value and of
uses which serve the abutting neighborhoods.
20.203 Applicability. The Prospect Street Overlay District shall be an overlay district on the
zoning map established by Section 3.20.
20.203.1 The buildings and land uses within said district shall be controlled by the pertinent
regulations of the base zoning district, except as they may be modified by the
requirements of this Section 20.200 which shall apply in addition to regulations
imposed by the base zoning districts.
20.204 Dimensional Standards in the Prospect Street Overlay District.
20.204.1 Modifications to the Definition of Gross Floor Area. Notwithstanding the definition of
Gross Floor Area contained in Article 2.000 - Definitions, the following shall not be
included as part of the gross floor area of any building in the Overlay District:

Open Space is not required under the applicable base zoning district for some or all
permitted uses, a minimum of 15% Green Area Open Space shall be required. This
Green Area Open Space may serve to help meet the requirement for Private Open
Space in any applicable base zoning district provided all dimensional standards for
Private Open Space are met. Notwithstanding the definition of Green Area Open
Space in Article 2.000, Definitions, a paved expansion of three (3) feet wide or less of
the adjacent public sidewalk devoted exclusively to pedestrian use, as permitted in
Section 20.204.32, may serve to help meet this Green Area Open Space
requirement.

building, or building in a local historic district or neighborhood conservation district,
on an abutting lot, shall consist of a minimum twenty-five (25) percent clear glass
in total for the facade, with clear glass increased to fifty (50) percent on the ground
floor where retail and office uses are established. The maximum amount of clear
glass permitted shall be seventy-five (75) percent of the facade. Reflective and
opaque glass shall be prohibited.
c. Where the façade of the ground floor is required to have a minimum of 50% clear
glass, that glass shall be distributed on the façade such that at least seventy-five
percent of the requirement is located below the midpoint between the finished
floor and the underside of the joists above.
d. For the purposes of this Section 20.206.1, the area of the façade of any given
floor shall be measured vertically from the finished interior floor to the underside of
the structural joist of the floor above.
20.206.2 Landscape. Front yards of buildings shall be landscaped to enhance the pedestrian
experience along Prospect Street. To the extent practicable, shade trees should be
incorporated along the sidewalk. The following standard shall apply:
For any new development or redevelopment on a lot, an existing or new tree shall be
required, on the lot within ten (10) feet of the public sidewalk or in the public sidewalk,
for each twenty-five (25) feet of lot frontage along Prospect Street.
20.207 Divergence from Standards
Divergence from the standards specified in Sections 20.204 - 20.206 may be allowed
by issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board. The Board shall grant such
a permit upon its determination that the development proposed will better serve the
objectives of this Section 20.200 than if the standards were followed and that the
criteria specified in Section 10.43 will be satisfied.
The Board shall be guided in its determination by Prospect Street Design Guidelines
and other such guidelines as may be established for the Prospect Street Overlay
District. This Section 20.207 is intended for variations from the standards, which may
be appropriate in specific locations and circumstances and where careful design detail
is a controlling factor.
20.208 Area of Special Planning Concern
The Prospect Street Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning
concern. Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 19.43.1  Applicability of Large
Project Review Procedure, in the Prospect Street Overlay District the Large Project
Review Procedure shall apply to any development proposal containing Gross Floor
20-60
Area of two thousand (2,000) square feet or more but less than fifty thousand (50,000)
square feet, unless such development is exempt by virtue of the provisions of Section
19.45.
For parcels that fall within both the Prospect Street Overlay District and the Central
Square Overlay District, this Large Project Review Consultation shall be conducted by
the Central Square Advisory Committee.
Before issuance of any special permit for development proposed within the Prospect
Street Overlay District that is subject to the Large Project Review Procedure or any
special permit required in this Section 20.200, Section 11.10 - Townhouse
Development, Section 4.26  Multifamily Special Permit, and Section 19.20 - Project
Review, the Planning Board shall determine that the proposal is consist with the
Prospect Street Design Guidelines.
20.209 Prospect Street Design Guidelines
New buildings and redevelopment of old buildings should contribute to improving the
character of Prospect Street. While it is recognized that not every project will meet
every guideline, it is expected that new development in the Prospect Street Overlay
District should be broadly consistent with the following principles:
1. Street-level facades should include active uses such as residential units and
entrances, shops, restaurant, cafes, exhibition space or display windows, or
commercial lobbies and front doors.
2. Blank walls should be avoided along the street. Transparent materials and
interior lighting should be used to maximize visibility of street level uses.
3. Principal building entrances should be located facing Prospect Street, where
appropriate.
4. Buildings should create a consistent street edge, with setbacks used generally
for stoops, porches, and front gardens in residential development or for café
seating, benches, or small open spaces in commercial development.
5. Awnings and canopies are encouraged to provide shelter and to enliven the
ground floor facade.
6. Where appropriate, buildings should be designed with individual units and front
doors facing the street, including units on the lower levels of multi-family
buildings.
7. Buildings should reflect a rhythm and variation appropriate to the urban context.
Facades should be articulated as several smaller masses using different
materials or colors, vertical breaks, bays, porches, stoops, and other architectural
elements.
8. Variations in height and architectural elements such as parapets, cornices and
other details are encouraged to create interesting and varied rooflines and to
clearly express the tops of buildings.
9. Where possible, windows should be located facing the street to increase safety.
10. Loading activities should be located on side streets or service alleys, where
possible.
20-61
11. Buildings should be designed to use natural resources and energy resources
efficiently in construction, maintenance, and long-term operation of the building.
12. Rooftop mechanical equipment should be sited and shielded to limit visual and
noise impacts.
13. Storage of trash should be sited and shielded to contain noise and visual clutter.
14. Lighting fixtures in surface parking lots should be designed to minimizing light
spillover onto adjacent properties.

established in the applicable base zoning district shall continue to apply to any lot in
the Central Square Overlay District unless specifically modified by the following
provisions:
20-65

The maximum FAR on any lot in an Office 3 District may be increased to 3.75
upon issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board provided a minimum of
twenty (20) percent of the total gross floor area authorized is devoted to affordable
housing as defined in Section 11.201. The affordable housing shall conform to
the standards of Section 11.204 except that lodging housing or single room

20.304.4 Waiver of Setback and Open Space Requirements.
1. Yard Setbacks. Upon issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board the yard
requirements of a base zoning district may be waived except where such yard abuts
a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay District. However, in waiving or
reducing a front yard setback, the Planning Board shall take into account the width of
the adjacent public sidewalk and may limit the reduction of the setback in order to
provide additional sidewalk width within the front yard setback where appropriate,
taking into account applicable City standards and expected pedestrian traffic on the
street.
2. Private Open Space. Open Space shall be provided as required in the Base Zoning
District, however the Planning Board may allow, by Special Permit, the reduction of
required Open Space, and permit such Open Space to be located at levels other than
at grade if the applicant can demonstrate that the urban design objectives as set forth
in the Central Square Overlay District can be met.
20.304.5 Use Limitations and Restrictions. In addition to the use regulations applicable in each
base zoning district the following use restrictions and limitations shall apply in the
Central Square Overlay District:

Massachusetts Avenue and/or Main Street and which is on a lot which shares a
common lot line with Massachusetts Avenue or Main Street shall consist of
Gross Floor Area devoted to any one or combination of uses permitted in the
applicable base zoning district [except that such gross floor area in buildings
abutting Massachusetts Avenue and/or Main Street between Inman and Pleasant

shall be at the mean grade of the abutting Massachusetts Avenue and/or
Main Street at the property line except that residential uses may be located
no higher than four (4) feet above the mean grade of the abutting street at
the property line.
b. The use shall have a minimum depth of twenty (20) feet.
c. Where other than residential uses are established, the ground (first) floor

strengthens the established historical character of existing buildings and
store fronts in Central Square.
b. The extent to which the particulars of the building or storefront design is
varied from the formula or standard design of the chain in order to reflect the
unique character and conditions of Central Square generally or the specific
location in particular.
20-68
c. The extent to which the standard elements of the enterprise as they define
it as a Formula Business are modified to respect and provide unique

20.304.6 Parking and Loading Requirements. The provisions set forth in Article 6.000 shall
apply except as modified by the provisions set below.
1. Maximum Parking. Where any of the following listed uses are established in the
Central Square Overlay District as of August 1, 2016, the accessory off-street parking
for such uses shall be limited by the maximum rates set forth below. For uses not
listed below, any maximum rate set forth in Article 6.000 shall apply. Exceeding the
maximum allowed parking shall require a waiver of maximum parking under the

minimum required parking ratio shall be 0.50 space per dwelling unit.
(b) Where the minimum number of parking spaces derived from the requirements of
Article 6.000 is greater than the maximum number of parking spaces derived
from Paragraph 1 above, the minimum required number of parking spaces shall
be reduced to the greatest number that conforms to the maximum requirements
derived from Paragraph 1 above.
3. Waiver of Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Central Square Overlay
District which meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and
loading requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and Loading
Requirements and the minimum requirements set forth in Paragraph 2 above.
(a) The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence on or
before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National Register or
contributing building; or
(b) The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure identified in
(1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided:
20-69
(i) The total development authorized on the site is reduced to ninety (90)
percent of the maximum permitted on the lot; or a cash contribution is made
to the Central Square Improvement Fund to be established by the City of
Cambridge in an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the cost of construction
of the parking spaces not provided, said contribution to be used by the City of
Cambridge for one or more of the following improvements in the Central
Square Overlay District:
(1) Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;
(2) Programming, events, and infrastructure that contribute to the Cultural
District established in Central Square;

The Central Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make comments
on any proposal for the expenditure of such cash contributions. The funds
shall not be used for ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by
the City of Cambridge. The value of the cash contribution shall be
determined by the Community Development Department assuming
equivalent structured parking spaces and using generally accepted cost
estimation methods customarily used by architects and engineers or using
actual construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction
in Cambridge.
(ii) The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a development
pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the retention of existing
structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a specific finding shall be
made that this objective has been met).
(iii) The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from parking and
loading requirements will result in a building design that is more appropriate
to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and that it is in conformance
with the objectives and criteria contained in Central Square Development
Guidelines.
(iv) No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as
to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing
building; and
(v) No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered
so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years
preceding the application.
4. Location of Parking. For any new development in the Central Square Overlay District
that requires a special permit from the Planning Board, notwithstanding anything to
20-70
the contrary in Article 6.000, the accessory parking may be provided on-site or within
existing parking facilities elsewhere in the Central Square Overlay District, subject to
Planning Board Approval. In general, new development shall use below-grade
structured parking instead of existing surface parking lots; however, the Planning
Board may approve the use of existing surface parking in special circumstances,
such as temporary parking for a phased development or special permits for smallscale
retail uses in existing buildings.
20.305 Standards for Issuance of Special Permits. In addition to the general standards for the
issuance of a special permit found in Section 10.40 of the Zoning Ordinance, the
special permit granting authority shall in addition make the following findings:
1. The proposed development is consistent with the goals and objectives of the
Central Square Action Plan:
 encourage responsible and orderly development;
 strengthen the retail base to more completely serve the needs of the
neighborhoods;
 preserve the Squares cultural diversity;
 create active people oriented spaces;
 improve the physical, and visual environment;
 provide retail establishments that serve people of diverse economic and
social groups who live in the surrounding neighborhoods;
 encourage the development of new mixed income housing; and
promote compatible retail adjacent to residential uses.
2. The building and site designs are consistent with Urban Design Plan for
Central Square as outlined in the Central Square Action Plan and the Central
Square Development Guidelines;
3. The building and site designs adequately screen the parking provided and are
sensitive to the contributing buildings in the vicinity;
4. No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing
building; and
5. No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered so
as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years preceding the
application.
20.306 Signs

20.307 Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income Subdistrict
20.307.1 Establishment and Scope.
There is hereby established within the Central Square Overlay District (and including
the rear portions of certain split lots that are partially located with the Central Square
Overlay District), the Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income Subdistrict which shall
be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.307.
These regulations are intended to provide incentives for residential development and
provide a transition between the character, uses and scale of Kendall Square, as well
as the adjacent Cambridgeport Revitalization Development District, and provide a
transition to the abutting residential districts behind Bishop Allen Drive. The subdistrict
is within the Citys Central Square (C2) Study area and adoption of this Section 20.307
follows extensive planning efforts to encourage residential and ground-floor retail uses
and transit-oriented development. The Central Square Study expands on past zoning
changes in industrial and commercial zones to encourage housing by offering greater
density to incentivize the creation of buffer zones for existing residential
neighborhoods adjacent to Central Square. The Mass and Main Residential Mixed
Income Subdistrict will also enable the City to respond to the 2014 Central Square
Customer Survey by supporting vibrant ground-floor retail and active retail uses at this
key intersection in Central Square, adjacent to mass transit. It is the intent of this
Section that these regulations will apply to a single area located at the intersection of
Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue and bounded and described in Section
20.307.2 below. The Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income Subdistrict will further
the objectives of the Central Square Study findings and other planning studies
completed by the City for the Central Square area by encouraging housing and
requiring both low- and moderate-income affordable housing in amounts above those
required by the Citys inclusionary housing requirements in Section 11.200.
20.307.2 Boundaries of the District.
The Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income Subdistrict shall be bounded as shown
on Map 20.307 and shall include two zones: the Mass Ave Residential Zone and the
Bishop Allen Drive Residential Support Zone. The Mass and Main Residential Mixed
Income Subdistrict includes lots located within the Business B and Business A base
zoning districts, with portions of some lots located within the Residence C-1 district
(and not included in the Central Square Overlay District) included in this subdistrict for
purposes of clarity with respect to the treatment of these split lots.
The Mass Ave Residential Zone consists of the Mass Ave Height Area and the
Columbia/Douglass Street Height Area and affects lots or portions of lots as shown on:

Assessors Plat #4710 and Map 91, Lot 23.
20.307.3 Applicability.
Except as otherwise noted herein, the provisions of this Section 20.307 shall apply to
both zones within the subdistrict.
For developers electing to conform to the provisions of this Section 20.307, any such
project shall be referred to herein as a Residential Mixed Income Project and,
notwithstanding any other provisions of the Ordinance, the use, dimensional, open
space, parking, loading and inclusionary housing requirements applicable to a
Residential Mixed Income Project shall be as set forth in this Section 20.307.
Divergence from the standards established in this Section may be allowed only by
issuance of a Special Permit by the Planning Board as specifically allowed pursuant to
applicable special permit provisions set forth elsewhere in the Ordinance, including the
provisions of Section 10.40. Further, the Planning Board may grant any applicable
special permit for a Residential Mixed Income Project that would ordinarily be granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeal. The Board may grant such a special permit upon its
determination that the development proposed will better serve the objectives of this
Section 20.307 and that the criteria specified in Section 10.43 specific and all other
criteria applicable to the special permit will be satisfied. A Residential Mixed Income
Project may contain more than one building constructed as part of a common scheme
of development or phased development program.
20.307.4 Review Process.

20-74
requirements for non-residential uses in the Business B zoning district shall apply to all
Residential Mixed Income Projects within the Business B district.
20.307.6.4 Private Open Space. Open space requirements in the Mass and Main Residential

2. said other lot is within four hundred (400) feet of the lot on which the use
being served is located.
d. A Residential Mixed Income Project shall provide, at a minimum, one (1) parking
space for every 100 residential units that shall be dedicated for use by a
carsharing organization (such as ZipCar or other similar program) (each such
parking space will be referred to herein as a Carsharing Space). Each
Carsharing Space within a Residential Mixed Income Project shall allow the
required number of residential parking spaces to be reduced by five (5) spaces,
but in no event may there be a total reduction of more than 0.17 spaces per
dwelling unit resulting from the application of this Paragraph (d).
e. Loading bays, drives, and a maneuvering space for a Residential Mixed Income
Project may be located entirely on the lot or adjacent easement areas with
immediate and direct ingress to the building intended to be served.
20-75
f. Any tandem parking spaces for two vehicles shall count as two parking spaces
within the Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income Subdistrict if such spaces are
accessory to a Residential Mixed Income Project, provided that such tandem
parking spaces may not account for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
required parking.
g. For purposes of Section 6.104.1, the applicable distance for Long-Term Bicycle
Parking shall be measured from the lot line of the lot on which the Long-Term
Bicycle Parking is located to the lot line of the lot on which the building or project
intended to be served is located.
20.307.8 Affordable Housing and Unit Mix Requirements for Residential Mixed Income Projects
20.307.8.1 Additional Inclusionary Housing Requirements. The provisions of Section 11.200 in
effect as of the date of adoption of this Section 20.307 shall apply to a Residential
Mixed Income Project. However, notwithstanding anything in Section 11.200, the FAR
of a Residential Mixed Income Project shall not exceed 6.5. Additionally, a Residential
Mixed Income Project shall be subject to the following requirements that may exceed
the requirements of Section 11.200:
a. A minimum of seventeen percent (17%) of the total number of units in a
Residential Mixed Income Project shall be Affordable Units for low and moderate
income households meeting the requirements of Section 11.200 for such

Middle Income Unit shall mean a unit for which the rent (including utilities) does not
exceed thirty (30) percent of the income of the renting household or for which the
mortgage payment (including insurance, utilities and real estate taxes) does not
exceed thirty (30) percent of the income of the purchasing household or other
standards as may be established pursuant to any city, state or federal housing
program designed to assist middle income households, for which the applicable
eligible household shall be an Eligible Middle Income Household.
Eligible Middle Income Household shall mean any household whose total income
does not exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the median income of
households in the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area adjusted for family
size, or such other equivalent income standard as may be determined by the Board of
Trustees of the Affordable housing Trust as defined in Section 11.201.
20-76
In no event shall the combined total number of Affordable Units for low and moderate
income households together with the Middle Income Units required in Section
20.307.8.1 above be fewer than twenty percent (20%) of the total number of units in a
Residential Mixed Income Project.
20.307.9 Local Retail and Street Activation.
In order to effectuate the goals of promoting a vibrant retail environment and streetlevel
activation, any proposed development within the Mass Ave Residential Zone with
building frontage along Massachusetts Avenue or Main Street shall include a plan (the
Retail Plan) for encouraging local, independent retail and active street-level uses
meeting the requirements of this Section 20.307.9, which Retail Plan shall be
submitted for review and approval by the Community Development Department prior
to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a Residential Mixed Income Project.
The owner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Retail Plan for
any Residential Mixed Income Project meets the goals of this Section 20.307.9 and,
taken in its entirety, is reflective of the economic and cultural diversity of the Central
Square neighborhood.
20.307.9.1 No banks or financial institutions shall be permitted on the ground floor level within the
Mass Ave Residential Zone.
20.307.9.2 The ground floor space in any such building frontage along Massachusetts Avenue or
Main Street and extending 30 feet into such building (the Building Frontage) shall be
devoted to retail uses, except for spaces required for accessory uses and other
building functions serving the other floors of such building which are typically located
at the ground level, including without limitation lobby space, building security,
access/egress, mailrooms, mechanical spaces and bicycle parking, which spaces
shall be limited to thirty percent (30%) of the total Building Frontage.
20.307.9.3 A minimum of 25% of the retail space required pursuant to Section 20.307.9.2 above
shall consist of Independent and Local Retailers. Independent and Local Retailers
shall include any retail operator which does not own or operate more than 10 retail
locations in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with the same name and retail
concept, such determination to be made as of the date of execution of a lease or
commencement of ownership of or other right to occupy such retail space.
20.307.9.4 The Retail Plan shall include a proposal for a seasonal public market concept/space
(the Public Market).

Zone.
20-77
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.000, any nonconforming parking structure
located in whole or in part within the Bishop Allen Drive Residential Support Zone and
which existed at the time of adoption of this Section 20.307 may be continued,
provided that it primarily serves a use permitted in the Mass and Main Residential
Mixed Income Subdistrict.
20.307.11 Sustainable Design Requirements for Residential Mixed Income Projects.
Residential Mixed Income Projects in the Mass and Main Residential Mixed Income
Subdistrict shall comply with the provisions of Section 22.20 of the Ordinance,
provided, however, that any new construction that is part of a Residential Mixed
Income Project shall be designed to a minimum standard of LEED Gold. In connection
with the submission requirements of Section 22.24.2.a., the developer of such
buildings shall submit a Statement of Energy Design Intent produced through the
EnergyStar Target Finder tool, or comparable method.
20.307.12 Design Guidelines Applicable to Residential Mixed Income Projects.
In reviewing any Residential Mixed Income Project subject to a Project Review Special
Permit under Article 19.000, the Planning Board shall look to the Central Square
Design Guidelines dated February 2013 (updated May 2013) for guidance and
direction in assessing the projects conformance with the applicable project review
criteria set forth in this Ordinance, provided that in the event of any conflict between
such Design Guidelines and this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall
govern. For a Residential Mixed Income Project proposing a building height exceeding
those contemplated in the Central Square Design Guidelines, the Planning Board shall
give consideration to the following supplemental guidelines:
a. Consider the variety of vantage points from which tall buildings will be seen,
especially from significant public spaces and nearby low-scale residential
neighborhoods, as well as city skyline views.
b. Tall buildings should be articulated to avoid a monolithic appearance, and should
emphasize slender, vertically-oriented proportions.
c. Avoid broad slab volumes that make the building appear bulky and visually
dominant. Point towers expressing vertical volumes are preferred.
d. Locate and shape tower elements to minimize shadows on existing or proposed
public open space and streets.
e. Configure towers to maximize sky views from public open space and enhance
visual connections through sites.
f. Consider variation in forms that present different profiles to different vantage
points.
g. If appropriate, step down tall buildings where they interface with adjoining historic
buildings.
20-78
h. Minimize impacts on the environmental performance and amenity of adjoining
residential buildings.
i. Consider the appearance of the building top both by day and night, while
demonstrating responsible use of lighting and energy consistent with sustainability
requirements.
j. Design buildings to minimize negative wind impacts on streets and public spaces.
20.307.13 Letter of Commitment
The Letter of Commitment dated May 18, 2015, signed by Stephen J. Cusma on
behalf of the proponent of the Mass and Main Zoning Petition referred to therein as
Normandy/Twining, (Letter) shall be binding upon any developer and/or owner of a
Residential Mixed Income Project as defined herein. The issuance of any building
permit or certificate of occupancy for a Residential Mixed Income Project shall be
conditioned upon certification by the Community Development Department and all
other relevant City departments to the Superintendent of Buildings evidencing that
such Residential Mixed Income Project is proceeding in accordance and in compliance
with all provisions of the aforementioned Letter.
20.400 PATHWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.401 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Pathway Overlay District,
which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this Section
20.400. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to those areas of
the city now or formerly railroad rights of way and which are anticipated to be used
now or in the future as bicycle and pedestrian commuting and recreational corridors.
20.401.1 The Pathway Overlay District shall be established on the Zoning Map of the City of
Cambridge under the provisions of Section 3.20.
20.402 General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.400 to modify existing base
district zoning regulations to ensure that (1) the unique opportunities presented by
railroad corridors to accommodate recreational bicycle and pedestrian paths are not
lost should their railroad function be abandoned, and that (2) the development
potential provided by virtue of the provisions of the base zoning district regulations
remains available for use beyond the limits of the Overlay District as the ownership of
the rights of way may change in the future.
20.403 General Provisions. Any portion of a lot encompassed by the Pathway Overlay District
shall consist entirely of any combination of Green Area, Permeable, or Public Open
Space or any railroad use in existence within the District on or before January 1, 2005
or any other railroad use permitted by the applicable base zoning district. The use,
dimensional and other provisions of the applicable base zoning district shall continue
to apply, but their application to a lot or portion of a lot in the Pathway Overlay District
are required to be consistent with this Section 20.403.
20-79
20.403.1 Reduction in the Required Open Space. The required area of Open Space may be
reduced after the issuance of a special permit from the Planning Board to allow
activities and uses, including vehicular access drives and accessory parking spaces,
permitted in the base district but in no case shall the construction of a building be
permitted. In granting such reduction the Planning Board shall find that the use or
activity proposed will not impair the future opportunity to construct pedestrian and
bicycle paths within the Pathway Overlay District nor otherwise derogate from the
intent and purpose of the Overlay district.
20.403.2 Additional Permitted FAR. Where a fee or easement property interest is conveyed to
the City of Cambridge (in a form acceptable to the City and recorded in the Registry of
Deeds) for any portion of land within the Pathway Overlay District, for use by the City
in the future to construction of a bicycle or pedestrian pathway, the applicable FAR on
that portion of land conveyed shall be equal to twice the FAR otherwise permitted on
the property as-of-right or by special permit in the applicable base zoning district or
Overlay district.
20.500 LESLEY PORTER OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.501 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Lesley Porter Overlay
District which shall be governed by regulations and procedures specified in this
Section. The District encompasses property constituting Lesley Universitys Porter
Square campus and has a Business C District base zoning designation.
20.502 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to augment existing zoning regulations to
respond to issues associated with institutional uses and unique planning opportunities
immediately adjacent to Porter Squares MBTA station. These regulations are
intended to allow for the establishment of an emerging art district associated with the
University, to enhance the vitality of Massachusetts Avenue by encouraging ground
floor uses that will serve the needs of abutting neighborhood residents and enhance
the established streetscape, to create a more harmonious and consistent character for
the development along Massachusetts Avenue and where such development faces or
abuts low density residential districts, and to encourage the retention and appropriate
reuse of buildings of historic value.
20.503 Applicability. The Lesley Porter Overlay District shall be an Overlay District on the
Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge established in Section 3.20.
20.503.1 The buildings and land uses within this district shall be controlled by the pertinent
regulations of the applicable base Business C zoning district and the Massachusetts
Avenue Overlay District, Section 20.100, except as modified by the requirements of
this Section 20.500. Where regulations differ among the several applicable zoning
districts, the provisions of this Section 20.500 shall apply.
20.503.11 The following terms shall apply in the Lesley Porter Overlay District.
1. Lots located westerly of Massachusetts Avenue shall be known as the Mt Vernon
Lots.
20-80
2. Lots located easterly of Massachusetts Avenue and north of Roseland Street shall
be known as the University Hall Lot.
3. Lots located easterly of Massachusetts Avenue and south of Roseland Street shall
be known as the Church Lot.
20.504 Overlay District Requirements
20.504.1 Floor Area Ratio Limitations.
1. Institutional Uses.
Not withstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 5.000 or elsewhere in this
Ordinance, the maximum FAR permitted in the Lesley Porter Overlay District
shall be 2.5 for those lots located easterly of Massachusetts Avenue and 2.0 for
those lots located westerly of Massachusetts Avenue for all educational
institutional uses set forth in Article 4.33.b (1) as further limited in Section 4.56 c
(4) and (6), after the granting of a Special Permit from the Planning Board,
subject to the following conditions and limitations:
a. Notwithstanding the definition of Lot in Article 2.000, a development project in
this Lesley Porter Overlay District may consist of non-contiguous lots and lots
separated by streets, which lots are held in common ownership. In
calculating the gross floor area (GFA) permitted for a development consisting
of educational institutional uses, the area of noncontiguous lots held in
common ownership within the Overlay District may be combined. For those
lots located easterly of Massachusetts Avenue, the resulting permitted Gross
Floor Area may be located on the individual University Hall or Church Lots or
transferred in part from the University Hall Lot to the Church Lot in an amount
not to exceed 25,000 square feet. All transferred Gross Floor Area shall be
located below grade.
b. Any Special Permit issued by the Planning Board in the Lesley Porter
Overlay District for increased FAR as permitted in this Section 20.504.1 (1)
shall result in a prohibition on dormitory uses on the Mt Vernon and
University Hall Lots.
c. Where, in seeking a special permit under the provisions of this Section
20.504.1, a development project is determined to be subject to the provisions
of Section 19.20  Project Review Special Permit, that project shall be
required to submit a Traffic Study as required in Section 19.24,
notwithstanding any other provision of Section 19.20.
2. Retail Uses
For a building abutting Massachusetts Avenue on the University Hall Lot or the
Mt. Vernon Lots that is occupied by retail uses set forth in Section 4.35 that are
located on the ground (first) floor of that building, which building is otherwise at
least 50% occupied by institutional uses, those retail uses shall be exempt from
20-81
the requirements of FAR and shall not be counted as Gross Floor Area. In no
event, however, shall this retail FAR exemption exceed 25,000 square feet of
gross floor area in any single building.
The retail enterprises receiving such FAR exemption shall be open to the general
public during normal business hours and are expected to provide goods and
services of interest to the general public not affiliated with any educational
institutional occupant of such building. The institution shall report to Planning
Board on the leasing activity in such exempt retail space in its annual Town
Gown Report presentation to the Board for five years after initial occupancy of
the last exempt Gross Floor Area.
20.504.2 Height.
1. Height shall be that permitted in the base Business C zoning district and,
notwithstanding other provisions in the Zoning Ordinance, shall be measured from
mean grade measured at the perimeter of the lot.
However, the height of any historic structure (including any building determined to
be a Preferably Preserved Significant Building by the Cambridge Historical
Commission under the provisions of Ordinance No. 965, designated as a landmark
pursuant to Chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code or the subject of a
Preservation Easement granted to the Cambridge Historical Commission) shall be
exempted from the provisions of Sections 5.33.2 and 5.43. All other new
construction within the Overlay District, however, shall be subject to these sections.
2. For the Mt Vernon Lots located westerly of Massachusetts Avenue, the maximum
height shall be limited to 45 for the lot located north of Mount Vernon Street and forty
(40) feet for the lot located south of Mount Vernon Street and shall be measured
from grade as provided for in Paragraph 1 above. The 35 foot transition height limit
required in Sections 5.33.2 and 5.43 shall continue to apply.
20.504.3 Setbacks, yards
1. Setbacks, except as otherwise provided in Section 20.504.3 (2) below, shall be the
same as required in the base zoning district (Business C) for all new construction
provided, however, that historic structures (as defined above) shall not be subject to
the yard requirements of Sections 5.41 and 5.42, including if all or a portion of such
structures is relocated on the same lot in the Overlay District.
2. Church Lot Setbacks.
a. There shall be a required setback of twenty (20) feet from the side lot line of the
Church Lot perpendicular to Roseland Street.
20-82
b. There shall be required a 7.5 foot front yard setback along the Frost Terrace front
lot line. Such setback shall not be subject to the surface parking restrictions of
Section 6.44.1 or the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District, Section 20.100.
c. In granting a special permit for development on the Church Lot the Planning
Board shall pay particular attention to the design details of the building wall facing
this lot line and the landscape treatment of the yard provided, as required in Section
20.505 (9) below. In general building walls should not remain uninterrupted for more
than thirty (30) feet, with changes in the plane of building wall of up to four (4) feet
encouraged.
20.504.4 Parking and Loading
Parking and loading requirements for any educational institutional use contained in the
Overlay District may be waived by the granting of a Special Permit from the Planning
Board except that any new Gross Floor Area in a building authorized by Special Permit in
the Lesley Porter Overlay District that results in the elimination of existing parking spaces
on the lots located westerly of Massachusetts Avenue or in the surface parking lot along
Roseland Street on the University Hall Lot shall not be permitted unless replacement
parking is provided.
Above ground parking structures shall not be permitted in the Overlay District with the
possible exception of the area on the University Hall Lot bordered by Roseland Street,
the MBTA railroad right of way, and a line parallel to and 250 feet easterly of the easterly
street line of Massachusetts Avenue, but only after a determination by the Planning
Board that the parking structure will be architecturally and visually well integrated within
the overall development. In order to make such a determination the Planning Board must
find the following:
1. The parking structure shall contain a principal use other than parking.
2. Portions of the structure containing parking that can be viewed from a public way shall
be architecturally treated so as to not appear to be a parking facility.
3. The portion of the structure where parking is located does not have an adverse effect
on the architectural character of the proposed building.
4. Portions of the parking structure are located below grade where feasible.
20.504.5 Open Space Requirements
The following Open Space requirements shall apply to those lots or portions of lots
located easterly of Massachusetts Avenue. The required Open Space may be any
combination of Green Area, Permeable, Public, Private or Publicly Beneficial Open
Space.
1. For the Church Lot in the Business C District located south of Roseland Street there
shall be a minimum ratio of Open Space to Lot Area of ten (10) percent. For purposes of
calculating Open Space under this provision the following requirements shall apply:
a. Open Space shall be located along the Massachusetts Avenue frontage and
have a depth of at least twenty (20) feet and shall have a minimum area of 3,000
contiguous square feet;
20-83
b. Area that is covered by a portion of a building but is open on three (3) sides with
a height of at least twelve (12) feet may be included;
c. Area that is ten (10) feet or more in any direction may be included.
2. For that portion of the University Hall Lot bordered by Roseland Street, the MBTA
railroad right of way, and a line parallel to and 250 feet easterly of the easterly street line
of Massachusetts Avenue there shall be a minimum ratio of Open Space of twenty-five
(25) percent and contain a minimum of 5,000 contiguous square feet of Open Space.
20.504.51 Special Church Lot and University Hall Lot Provisions.
Where a special permit is required for any development on the Church Lot under the
provisions of the Lesley Porter Overlay District, the applicant shall be required to submit
as part of that application a plan for providing a portion of the Open Space required in
Section 20.504.5 (2) above on the University Hall Lot, particularly focused along the
Roseland Street edge. The plan should also include proposed improved pedestrian
connections throughout the lot.
The plan as approved by the Planning Board shall be implemented simultaneously with
the construction authorized by the special permit for the development on the Church Lot.
20.505 Special Permit Criteria
In granting a Special Permit under this Section 20.500, in addition to the other criteria
specified in Section 10.40, the Planning Board shall take into consideration the following
and make appropriate findings related thereto:
1. Contribute to the vitality of Porter Square by concentrating academic activities
that will provide publicly accessible uses including arts libraries, galleries and a
wide range of activities and classes and that will have positive spillover effects on
the retail environment of the Square.
2. Contribute to Porter Squares vitality, identity and sense of place by removing
existing on-grade parking lots and constructing new structures that spatially
define and enrich Massachusetts Avenue and incorporate active ground floor
uses and buffering them from the activity and noise along Massachusetts
Avenue.
3. Minimize adverse impacts on abutting low-density housing by appropriately
designing and programming new structures location on the lot, massing, scale,
use and operations.
4. Preserve, reuse and highlight historic structures as integral, publicly accessible
parts of the overlay district.
5. Provide retail activity that serves local residents and Lesley community needs,
strengthens the corridors existing retail base and provides a more dynamic,
mixed-use image.
20-84
6. Minimize vehicular traffic and demand for on street parking in the residential
neighborhood by concentrating activity near the T station, maximizing a mix of
uses that reinforce each other, and enhance the pedestrian environment.
7. The Open Space along the easterly side of Massachusetts Avenue south of
Roseland Street, described in Section 20.504.5 (1), should be inviting and
provide places for rest and gathering with an appropriate public art focus.
8. The Open Space along Roseland Street described in Section 20.504.5 (2) should
reflect an urban campus character, which would include an entry forecourt
along the axis of neighboring Frost Street. There shall also be a well-defined
walkway through this area that provides pedestrian connections from Roseland
Street to Massachusetts Avenue.
9. Where proposed construction abuts existing residential development, special
attention should be paid to proposed setbacks, location of open space features,
and building design to ensure reasonable compatibility between the scale and
extent of new construction and the scale and character of the existing pattern of
residential development. Use of variable height and variable setback planes,
reduction in the length of continuous building walls, amount of landscaping, etc.
should be employed to achieve these objectives.
10. The Board shall consider the impact of the development on residential neighbors
as it may affect privacy. Location and size of windows, screening elements,
decks, entries and other aspect of the design shall be reviewed to maintain
reasonable levels of privacy for abutters. The Board shall also consider the
nature of the uses contained in the buildings constructed.
11. Inclusion of physical improvements to the public right of way along
Massachusetts Avenue that enhance its quality as a pedestrian environment,
retail shopping district and place for meeting and congregating for neighborhood
residents and visitors.
12. The adequacy of the proposed construction mitigation plan, as set forth in
Section 18.20 of the Zoning Ordinance.
20.506 Consistency with Letter of Commitment
Prior to the issuance of any building permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any
construction authorized by special permit under the provisions of this Section 20.500, the
Community Development Department shall certify to the Inspectional Services
Department that all provisions of the Letter of Commitment dated June 22, 2009 by
Lesley University are continuing to be met.
20.600 BASEMENT HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.610 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Basement Housing Overlay
District which shall be governed by the Regulations and procedures specified in this
Section 20.600. The purpose of this Section 20.600 is to allow for the creation of studio
20-85
or one-bedroom apartment units in appropriate unused basement level space of certain
existing multifamily residential buildings that have one or more existing basement level
apartment units. Given the increasing expense of unsubsidized rental housing in
Cambridge, the shortage of reasonably priced, affordable studio and one bedroom units,
and the difficulty this poses for local workers, students and the elderly, it is in the public
interest to permit the creation of additional units under circumstances which promote the
maintenance and improvement of older buildings, including improved stormwater and
wastewater management, and which provide additional housing without building new
structures or increasing the size of existing structures. The corridor along Massachusetts
Avenue between Harvard Square and Porter Square contains a significant number of
buildings wholly or partially on lots with a base district among the Residence C family of
use categories (Res. C, C-1, C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, C-3B) which because of
their age, location, current existence of one or more basement units, and proximity to
public transit options, present an ideal set of circumstances for the City to encourage the
creation of basement units and thereby explore the desirability and viability of possible
expansion of similar development elsewhere in the City.
20.620 Applicability. The regulations of this Section 20.600 shall apply within the Basement
Housing Overlay District to existing structures designed and built for residential use,
which also meet all of the following standards:
a. the structure is located wholly or partially within a Residence C, C-1, C-1A, C-2A,
C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, or C-3B base zoning district;
b. the structure is currently occupied by at least thirty (30) dwelling units;
c. the structure was built before 1930 and its footprint or foundation has not been
expanded or altered after the effective date of this Section 20.600 except as may
be required and approved as a condition to the grant of a special permit
hereunder;
d. the structure currently contains at least one dwelling unit located entirely at the
basement level.
Portions of those structures that meet the applicability requirements set forth above that
are not located within a Residence C family zoning district would be treated for all
dimensional and use requirements as if wholly located within a Residence C family
zoning district.
20.630 Standards. Where it is proposed to create additional dwelling units by converting existing
Gross Floor Area, which is not presently occupied by dwelling units, into dwelling units at
the basement level of the existing structure, the dimensional and parking standards
generally applicable in any base zoning district shall apply. However, where some or all
of those requirements cannot be met, the Planning Board may waive some or all of the
dimensional and parking standards generally applicable in the base district upon
issuance of a special permit, subject to the following limitations:
a. Where the Floor Area Ratio of the existing structure exceeds the maximum Floor
Area Ratio allowed in the base zoning district, the Gross Floor Area of the
existing structure shall not be increased.
b. Where the existing structure or lot does not conform to the height, yard, or private
open space requirements generally applicable in the district, the Planning Board
may approve those dimensional characteristics of the existing building or lot.
However, no nonconforming dimensional element or aspect of the existing
structure shall be extended or increased, with the exception that the permitted lot
area per dwelling unit may be decreased, and incursions into setback areas may
be approved by the Planning Board only for the purpose of providing or altering
window wells or egress stairs as may be deemed advisable in response to safety
and flooding concerns.
c. The number of dwelling units in the existing structure shall not be increased by
more than ten (10) units or fifteen percent (15%) of the number of dwelling units
in the existing building, whichever is fewer.
20-86
d. Newly created dwelling units shall be restricted to studio or one-bedroom
apartments only.
e. The Planning Board may reduce or waive the number of accessory off-street
motor vehicle parking spaces required by Article 6.000 upon making a finding
that such reduction will not result in substantial adverse impacts to on-street
parking, based on information provided by the Applicant regarding the availability
of alternate transportation options or other factors that would result in a reduced
demand for parking. As a condition of a special permit, the Planning Board may
require measures to minimize parking demand generated by the building. The
requirements of Article 6.000 may not otherwise be waived.
f. At least one additional secure long-term bicycle storage space shall be created
on the lot for each new dwelling unit created under the provisions of this Section.
Such bicycle parking spaces shall conform to the design standards of Section
6.49, and the City of Cambridge Bicycle Parking Guide, published spring 2008 or
later.
20.640 Conditions for Grant of Special Permit. Prior to granting a special permit pursuant to this
Section the Planning Board shall determine that the proposed conversion of basement
space to dwelling units complies with the General Special Permit Criteria set forth in
Section 10.43 as well as with the following requirements:
a. Each new unit converted from existing basement space shall comply with all
building, health, and accessibility codes applicable to residential dwelling units in
the basement of structures. A special permit granted pursuant to this Section
shall be conditioned upon full compliance with all building and sanitary code
requirements applicable to basement unitsto be approved by the Commissioner
of Inspectional Services at the time of application for a building permit. As a
condition of the special permit, the Planning Board may require reasonable
measures as are deemed necessary for the adequate privacy and security of the
occupants.
b. Buildings must contain, or install, full separation between storm water and
sanitary sewer lines from the building to the connection in the street regardless of
whether the street in which the building is connected currently is separated.
c. Adequate, properly installed, backflow prevention devices that comply with all
building code and other applicable requirements must be installed for all newly
created units along with any additional measures determined to be advisable by
the City Engineer.
d. An application for a special permit pursuant to this Section shall include a report
on historical occurrences and future likelihood of basement flooding in the area of
the proposed conversion, prepared by a registered professional engineer, with a
functional scope determined by the City Engineer to be appropriate to the
location of the project. In general, the report shall assess the likelihood of
flooding in the basement units by way of sewer system backups or overland
flooding and identify proposed mitigation to prevent any such flooding. The
Applicant shall obtain approval of the report and proposed mitigation, if any, from
the City Engineer prior to submitting a special permit application. As a condition
of the special permit, the Planning Board may require preventive measures to
safeguard against future flooding in the proposed basement-level units as
recommended by the City Engineer.
20.650 Affordability. The Inclusionary Housing requirements of Section 11.200 shall apply to any
new dwelling units that exceed the threshold for an Inclusionary Project as set forth in
Section 11.201. Any project which receives a special permit pursuant to this Section, but
does not exceed the threshold for an Inclusionary Project, shall provide no less than one
Affordable Unit, as defined in section 11.201 and subject to the Standards for
Construction and Occupancy of Affordable Units set forth in Section 11.204.
20-87
20.660 Notwithstanding the base district in which any part of the structure is located, the entirety
of any structure that meets the applicability requirements of Section 20.620 and that is in
the Basement Housing Overlay District shall be eligible for the special permit created by
this Section 20.600. Where any proposed dwelling units in that structure are to be located
in any portion of the structure that is in a base zone in which the use would not otherwise
be allowed, or would not be allowed without separate approval under Article 8, those
dwelling units shall be eligible to be allowed pursuant to a Special Permit under this
Section 20.600 and upon the grant of that Special Permit shall be allowed without need
for approval under Article 8 or the grant of any variance or additional zoning approvals.
20.700 deleted (see Section 11.800)
20.800 CAMBRIDGE HIGHLANDS OVERLAY DISTRICT
20.801 Purpose. It is the purpose of the Cambridge Highlands Overlay District to modify the
base zoning requirements applicable in the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood with the
intent of supporting the unique character of that district, which is predominantly modestsized
single-family and two-family homes. Stricter controls are applied to development
on larger lots so that they might better fit the established character of the neighborhood.
20.802 Establishment and Applicability. There is hereby established on the Zoning Map of the
City of Cambridge the Cambridge Highlands Overlay District. Except as set forth in this
Section, the requirements applicable in the base zoning district shall apply within the
Cambridge Highlands Overlay District.
20.803 Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit. The permitted number of dwelling units on a lot within the
Cambridge Highlands Overlay District shall be calculated as follows. A minimum lot area
per dwelling unit of two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet shall apply to the first
five thousand (5,000) square feet of lot area. For those portions of any lot exceeding five
thousand (5,000) square feet, the minimum lot area of each permitted dwelling unit shall
be five thousand (5,000) square feet. However, for any lot in existence as of May 5, 2014
that is subsequently subdivided into two or more lots, the total number of units on the
subdivided lots, in total, shall at no time exceed that permitted on the lot before the
subdivision occurred. Unless otherwise permitted by special permit from the Board of
Zoning Appeal, the dwelling units permitted on each subdivided lot shall be in the same
ratio as that lots area is to the area of the unsubdivided lot. Nothing in this Section shall
prohibit the subdivision of a Townhouse Development conforming at the time of its
construction, as permitted in Section 11.10. Where the base zoning sets forth a more
restrictive standard, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
20.804 Townhouse and Multifamily Special Permit Applicability. A special permit pursuant to the
Procedure for Townhouses and Multifamily Dwellings set forth in Section 10.47 of the
zoning Ordinance shall be required for any development resulting in a total of three (3) or
more units on a lot that is wholly or partially within the Cambridge Highlands Overlay
District.

21.10 TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS (TDR)  GENERAL PROVISIONS
21. 11 Purpose. It is the intent of this Article 21.000 to establish regulations by which Gross Floor
Area (GFA) permitted on one lot or lots, as determined by the zoning district applicable to that
lot [the Donating Lot(s)], may be transferred and used on another lot or lots [the Receiving
Lot(s)] in the same or different zoning district in order to (i) introduce a level of flexibility into
the development of designated areas in the city in ways that construction on one lot at a time
cannot accomplish, (ii) allow multiple owners to coordinate development on small lots that may
not be contiguous, (iii) facilitate the implementation of urban design and other planning
objectives, particularly in contexts where there may be many, small lots and multiple property
owners, and (iv) to allow development to respond to market forces and infrastructure patterns
in ways that further public transportation and urban design objectives. The restrictions that
otherwise apply in the Zoning Ordinance restricting development to a single lot in single
ownership shall be modified by the regulations contained in this Article 21.000.
21.12 Establishment and Scope. The Transfer of Development Rights may be secured through the
provisions of a (1) a Development Rights Transfer Overlay District designated from time to
time on the Zoning Map or (2) through the provisions of an Overlay District, having multiple
regulatory objectives or through the provisions of a Special District. The Transfer of
Development Rights shall be regulated by the general provisions of this Section 21.10 and by
specific provisions established for each individual district.
21.13 Procedure. The transfer of GFA from a Donating Lot to a Receiving Lot shall be permitted by
special permit from the Planning Board and shall be subject to further provisions set forth
below in Section 21.13.1. The transfer shall be permitted between contiguous and noncontiguous
lots that may be held in common or separate ownership, notwithstanding any
definition of lot or owner set forth in Article 2.000 of this Ordinance or elsewhere in the
Ordinance.
21.13.1 Special Permit Procedures.
21.13.11 Required Information. In applying for a special permit to permit the transfer of GFA from one
or more Donating Lots to one or more Receiving Lots, the following information shall be
provided:
1. The location of all Donating Lots and all Receiving Lots.
2. Enumeration of the GFA to be transferred, GFA to be retained on the Donating Lot, and
the total GFA to be accommodated on the Receiving Lot; the calculations by which the
proposed GFA on all sites has been determined.
3. Schematic development plans showing the proposed development on both the Donating
and the Receiving lots.
4. A narrative describing the plans compliance with all requirements of this Section 21.10
and the specific Transfer of Development Rights provisions of other applicable sections
of the Zoning Ordinance, consistency with any applicable design guidelines and area
plan, and with the Citywide Urban Design Objectives, Section 19.30.
5. The schedule by which necessary demolition will take place and authorized construction
will commence and be completed. Where it is proposed to occupy transferred GFA
before a Donating Lot has been brought into compliance with the requirements of the
special permit, the legal instruments proposed by which the requirements applicable to it
will be met.
6. The status of leaseholds for tenants in any GFA on a Donating Lots in structures that are
required to be demolished or converted to residential uses, and the mechanisms by
which those leaseholds will be terminated and the site brought into compliance with the
requirements of the special permit.
21.13.12 Special Permit Conditions. The Planning Board shall establish in its Decision granting a
special permit under the provisions of this Section 21.10 conditions that address at a
minimum, the following:
1. The sequence by which construction and demolition are to occur on both the Donating and
Receiving Lots;
2. The binding commitments to be executed if occupancy of new GFA on the Receiving Lot is to
occur before demolition of GFA transferred out from the Donating lot or before new on the
Donating Lot.
3. The legal instruments by which a proposed park or other public amenity is to be made
available to the general public, where applicable.
4. The process by which final development plans are to be approved by the Planning Board.
21.14 Reservation of Gross Floor Area by Owners of Donating Lots. To provide flexibility over time
in the utilization of GFA available to be transferred, the Planning Board may issue a special
permit to permit the reservation of GFA from a Donating Lot to be applied at a later date to a
Receiving Lot through a second special permit process. The reservation may be for any
length of time acceptable to the Planning Board.
The Board, in granting the special permit, shall approve the permanent development plan for
the Donating Lot.
Substantial Use of such special permit, as required in Section 10.46 of the Zoning Ordinance,
shall be that date at which it is filed with the Registry of Deeds for Middlesex County.
The Planning Board may establish such conditions as it deems appropriate to ensure that
development on the donating lot is consistent with the conditions of the special permit until the
development rights are fully utilized on a future receiving lot.
21.15 Application for a Building Permit. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any construction on
any Donating or Receiving Lot linked through the issuance of a single special permit, the
Superintendent of Buildings shall determine, based on information provided with the
application (including a certification from the Community Development Department that all
conditions of the special permit are met), that all Donating and Receiving Lots continue to be
in conformance with the conditions of the special permit, the provisions of this Section 21.10,
and the applicable base zoning districts. Among the information to be provided are the
following:
1. An identification of all lots subject to the requirements of a single special permit.
2. A list of all building permits issued for those lots since the granting of the authorizing
special permit.
3. The GFA existing and authorized on each lot at the time of the application.
4. An enumeration of the GFA authorized on each lot by the Special Permit.
21.16 Dimensional Limitations. Except as may be provided elsewhere in the Ordinance in the
individual Transfer of Development Rights Districts and Provisions, all development on both
Donating and Receiving Lots shall be subject to the dimensional limitations of the applicable
base district with the exception of the FAR limitation. On Receiving Lots, Gross Floor Area
may be increased above the FAR limit normally applicable to the extent of GFA transferred
from Donating Lots by special permit.
21.20 EASTERN CAMBRIDGE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS TRANSFER DISTRICT
(TDD and TRD)
21.21 Purpose. It is the intent of this Section 20.30 to (1) reduce the density of development close to
the existing residential neighborhoods and (2) encourage housing construction compatible with
the existing residential neighborhoods through the transfer of existing or potential development
to other locations. It is also intended to facilitate the construction of additional residential,
office, research and development, retail, and manufacturing uses in areas of eastern
Cambridge that are close to transit services, and on sites now fully developed that can more
effectively serve the citys Urban Design Objectives, as set forth in Section 19.30 of the
Ordinance, with additional building construction. For the purposes of this Section 20.30,
residential use shall be as defined as uses set forth in Section 4.31 a-h
21.22 Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Eastern Cambridge Development
Rights Transfer Districts which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified
in this Section 20.30. These regulations shall apply to areas described below or as they may
be otherwise identified on the Zoning Map, which shall be designated as Eastern Cambridge
Development Rights Transfer Donating District (TDD) or Eastern Cambridge Development
Rights Transfer Receiving District (TRD) on the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge
established in Section 3.20.
21.23 Boundaries of the Districts.
The boundaries of the districts shall be as described below.

feet distant from the easterly sideline of Portland Street and Cardinal Medeiros Avenue, and
(b) that portion of the Industry B zone located south of Main Street and bounded by the
centerlines of Albany Street; Massachusetts Avenue; Windsor Street; a line southerly of,
parallel to, and one hundred and fifty feet distant from the southerly sideline of Main Street; a
line easterly of, parallel to and one hundred and fifty feet distant from the southwesterly
extension of the centerline of Portland Street north of Main Street; and then Main Street to the
point of beginning . The Receiving District shall be that area where GFA from a Donating Lot is
used for development. A Receiving Lot shall be a lot in the Receiving District to which GFA is
moved.
21.24 Procedure. The transfer of GFA from the Donating District to the Receiving District shall be
permitted by special permit from the Planning Board and shall be subject to further provisions set
forth below in Section 20.36. The transfer shall be permitted between non-contiguous lots that
may be held in separate ownership, notwithstanding any definition of lot set forth in Article 2.000
of this Ordinance.
21.25 Limitations, Requirements, and Conditions Applicable to Lots in the Sending District

Non-Residential Structures to Residential Use, where it is proposed to reuse a nonresidential
structure for residential use, or.
(2) The GFA resulting from an FAR of 0.75 in Residence C-1 base district or 1.25 in any
non-residential base district.
21.25.21 Residual Residential Gross Floor Area on a Donating Lot Available for Transfer to a Lot in the
Receiving District.
The residential GFA permitted on a lot in any residential or non-residential zoning district as
determined by Section 20.34.2 above may be transferred to any receiving lot provided the
future residential development potential on the Donating Lot is not reduced below an FAR of
0.75.
21.25.3 Restrictions on the Donating Lot after Transfer is Authorized.
(1) All non-residential GFA existing or permitted under the zoning district regulations
applicable on the Donating Lot, whichever is greater, must be transferred, held for future
transfer, or abandoned. No non-residential development potential shall remain on the Donating
Lot and no use variance may be granted to reestablish non-residential uses after the transfer
of GFA has occurred. Any active non-residential use shall be discontinued.
(2) Development on the Donating Lot is limited to residential use or a public park. Where
residential development is proposed to be established, the future residential development shall
not have an FAR of less than 0.75. All existing gross floor area not redeveloped to residential
use shall be demolished where housing is to be established on the site. The entire site shall
be cleared if it is to be developed as a public park.
(3) No building or structure determined to be a Preferably Preserved Significant Building by the
Cambridge Historical Commission, as provided in Ordinance No. 965 of the Ordinances of the

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraphs (1)  (3) above, or other provisions of this
Section 20.30, the remaining residential GFA on a Donating Lot may contain any office or
retail use permitted in the applicable base district up to ten (10) percent of the permitted
residential GFA.
21.26 Dimensional and Use Limitations on the Receiving Lot.
The GFA transferred from any Donating Lot to a Receiving Lot shall be subject to the following
provisions:
(1) The transferred GFA shall not be subject to any FAR or GFA limitations applicable to
the receiving lot, including lots which already exceed permitted FAR limits.
(2) Transferred Non-residential GFA may be used for any use permitted on the Receiving
Lot. However, where any non-residential use is limited to a maximum percentage of total
development on the Receiving Lot or Development Parcel, the transferred GFA shall be
subject to that limitation unless the transferred GFA is in addition to, and not a substitute
for, the GFA and use limitations otherwise applicable on the Receiving Lot or
Development Parcel.
(3) Residential GFA transferred, as permitted in Section 20.34.21 above, shall only be
used for residential uses on the receiving lot.
(4) All other dimensional limitations applicable to the receiving lot shall apply to the
transferred GFA.
21.30 SPECIAL DISTRICTS 8, 8A, 9 and 10
Transfer of Development Rights shall be permitted in Special Districts 8, 8A, 9 and 10 for the
purpose of creating open space facilities, pursuant to the general provisions of Section 21.10
above and the following specific requirements.
21.31 Transfer of Development Rights and/or Additional Height to secure Publicly Accessible Open
Space.
The Planning Board may permit the transfer of all of the gross floor area permitted as of right
or by special permit on one or more Donating Lots located in Special District 8, Section 17.81,
or Special Districts 8A, 9 and 10, Sections 17.82, 17.90 and 17.100, to one or more Receiving
Lots located in Special District 8 and may permit in conjunction with that transfer an increase
in the permitted height on the Receiving Lot for the purpose of creating an open space facility
of approximately fifty-nine thousand (59,000) square feet and such other additions to that
space or the creation of other such open space facilities as may be offered that are accessible
to the general public and designed and intended to be used for active and/or passive
recreation. The special permit shall be granted subject to the following requirements:
1. One open space parcel containing an area of approximately fifty-nine thousand (59,000)
square feet, as shown on Lots # 48 and 57 on Assessor's Plat # 95, shall be a Donating
Lot and must be secured as an open space as required in this Section 21.30 before any
other lot may be considered a Donating Lot; other open space parcels within the Special
District 8 or Special Districts 8A, 9 and 10 may also be Donating Lots.
2. The FAR on the Receiving Lot does not exceed 2.5 for nonresidential uses or 3.0 FAR
for residential and dormitory use.
3. The Receiving Lot for the one hundred three thousand, two hundred fifty (103,250)
gross square feet or more of floor area to be transferred is located in Special District 8.
4. The maximum height of any structure on the Receiving Lot may be increased subject to
the following limitations:
a. Sixty (60) feet in that area lying between Sidney Street and a line, which line is
parallel to, southeasterly of and one hundred (100) feet distant from Sidney
Street;
b. Ninety (90) feet in that area lying between the parallel line described in
Paragraph (a) above and Albany Street;
c. One hundred (100) feet in that area lying southeasterly of Albany Street.
5. The donating site for an open space contribution of approximately fifty-nine thousand
(59,000) square feet is located at 82 Pacific Street as shown on lots # 48 and 57, on
Assessor's Plat # 95.
6. Open space facilities shall be under the control of, and be programmed and maintained
by the City of Cambridge or its designated agent. Transfer of open space facilities to the
City shall be by fee simple conveyance, easement, lease (see Paragraph 8 below) or other
legal mechanism, and shall be made as a condition precedent to the issuance of the first
building permit for a project on a Receiving Lot which utilizes development rights granted
by Special Permit for that project. Special Permits granted under this Section 21.30 shall
run with the land.
7. The site is physically suitable for the recreational uses proposed and certified by the
City to meet environmental standards such as they are applied to other such open spaces
in the City at the time of transfer to the City of Cambridge.
8. If the development rights transferred by the Special Permit to a Receiving Lot are not
fully utilized or applied in the construction of a project, the remaining development rights
shall remain available for use or application, on a phase by phase basis, on the receiving
lot. If development rights are applied by a landowner, on a phase by phase basis, the
donating lot (from which the development rights derive) shall be leased, on a completely
net basis, by the owner of the donating lot to the City of Cambridge, or its designated
agent, until such time as the receiving lot has fully utilized or applied the development
rights derived from the donating lot. When those development rights are fully utilized or
applied, which shall be determined by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any
building making use of such rights, fee simple title to the donating lot shall be conveyed to
the City of Cambridge or its designated agent; in its decision the Planning Board shall
determine if fee simple title shall be conveyed in phases as development rights are utilized
or applied or when the entire amount of development rights is fully utilized. If development
rights are applied or utilized on a phase by phase basis, and if, because of an amendment
or other change in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge, the owner of the
receiving lot is unable to receive the full benefits of those development rights (in the same
manner and to the same extent as if the Zoning Ordinance had not been amended or
otherwise changed), the lease of the donating lot to the City of Cambridge shall terminate
automatically upon the effective date of that amendment or other change in the Zoning
Ordinance.
Any special permit issued under the provisions of this Section 21.30 shall be in force and
effect for the length of lease of property for open space purposes as required in this
Section 21.30. For the purposes of Section 10.46, the use authorized by any special
permit issued under this Section 21.30 shall be deemed to have commenced with the
granting of the lease of land for open space purposes as defined in this Paragraph 8.
21.32 Special Permit Conditions. In granting a special permit under this Section 17.81.5 the Planning
Board shall consider the following:
1. The proposed open space is consistent with the objectives of this Section 21.30 to
create a private open space or recreational facility addressing the unmet needs of the
adjacent residential neighborhood and those of the new residents of the district and, if one
is adopted, is consistent with a plan for the distribution and use of open space in the
District.
2. If less than one acre, the open space is clearly an element of a plan to be implemented
incrementally created through the issuance of additional special permits, or is clearly
acceptable as an independent facility.
1. If it is intended to be a part of a larger facility, the open space is useable on its
own, as an independent facility, if intended future special permits are not sought
or granted.
21.40 ALEWIFE OVERLAY DISTRICTS 1-6
21.41 Purpose. It is the intent of this Section 21.40 (i) to reduce the density of development adjacent
to the existing residential neighborhood of the Cambridge Highlands; (ii) to encourage greater
development density closer to public transit and to facilitate infrastructure improvements that
will make those transit services more widely available in the Alewife Overlay Districts; (iii) to
facilitate a more orderly development pattern within the Alewife Overlay Districts, including
increasing the opportunities for installation of new circulation pathways for pedestrian, bicycles
and vehicles; creation of new public or private open space facilities; and development of new
pedestrian connections from the Quadrangle to the Triangle; (iv) to make additional land
surface available for better stormwater management and increased permeability; and (v) to
encourage a more attractive pattern of new buildings consistent with the urban design
objectives set forth in the Concord-Alewife Plan.
21.42 Procedure. The procedures set forth in Section 21.10 above shall apply to this Section 21.20.
21.43 Limitations, Requirements, and Conditions Applicable Donating Lots.
21.43.1 Gross Floor Area Available for Transfer from a Donating Lot to a Receiving Lot.
1. Some or all of the Gross Floor area permitted on the Donating Lot, as determined by the
applicable base zoning district regulations, any additional development allowed in Section
20.90 by special permit, and by the provisions of Section 5.28.2 as they apply to existing
development on the site, may be transferred to a Receiving Lot.
2. Where any legally established Gross Floor Area existing on the lot at the time of application
to permit the transfer exceeds that permitted on the lot, that Gross Floor Area shall be
available in whole or in part for transfer to the Receiving Lot.
3. Residential Gross Floor Area transferred from a Donating Lot may only be used for
residential purposes on the Receiving Lot. Non-residential Gross Floor Area transferred from
a Donating Lot may be used for any permitted use on the Receiving Lot.
4. Special Provisions Related to Utility and Railroad Land. As railroad and utility facilities
cannot easily be reused for other purposes while the railroad or utility function is active, special
limitations shall be imposed for the transfer of any development potential on those sites though
the provisions of this Section 21.40. Therefore, Gross Floor Area permitted on a railroad rightof
way, railroad freight terminal, railroad yard and shop (Section 4.32 (c)) or utility transformer
station, substation, gas regulator station (Section 4.32 (g 2) may not be transferred to any
other lot under the provisions of this Section 21.40 unless the Planning Board finds that the
donating lot, after the transfer of GFA, will be substantially improved to the benefit of the
general public, consistent with the objectives of the Concord-Alewife Plan. In making that
finding the Planning Board shall consider the following:
a. Significant portions of the Donating Lot are redeveloped to housing, technical office
uses, or permeable open space as set forth in Section 21.43.2 (1) below.
b. Rights of way or construction of pedestrian and bicycle pathways and roadway
segments, elements of the pedestrian bridge across the railroad right of way from the
Quadrangle to the Triangle, and water retention/detention systems are provided,
consistent with the Plan.
c. The additional GFA on the Receiving Lot can be reasonably accommodated in a
positive way with regard to management of the additional traffic created and site and
building design proposed in the context of the surrounding pattern of development.
d. In other demonstrable ways the objectives of the Plan are advanced to an extent
commensurate with the scale of the GFA transfer being requested.
21.43.2 Restrictions on the Use of the Donating Lot after Transfer is Authorized.
1. Where it is proposed to transfer all development allowed on the Donating Lot, the
lot shall be thereafter developed in one of the following ways:
a. As a Public, Green Area, Permeable or Publicly Beneficial Open Space.
b. For any residential use permitted in a Residence C-1 District in a building
or buildings meeting all the dimensional requirements of the Residence
C-1 District. An FAR of 0.75 shall be authorized on the site, in addition
to that authorized for transfer to the Receiving Lot. Such additional
FAR, however, shall not be granted for transfers of GFA that only occur
within the boundaries of a single Overlay District.
c. Any technical office for research and development, laboratory and
research facility, Section 4.34 f, in a building or buildings constructed to
meet all the dimensional requirements of the Office 1 District. An FAR
of 0.75 shall be authorized on the site, in addition to that authorized for
transfer to the Receiving Lot. Such additional FAR, however, shall not
be granted for transfers of GFA that only occur within the boundaries of a
single Overlay District.
i. Where an existing building has a Gross Floor Area at or
below an FAR of 0.75 and is occupied by a Technical office for
research and development use, such building and use shall be
considered to meet the requirements of this Subparagraph c
and the full transfer from the lot of permitted FAR shall be
permitted.
2. Where it is proposed to retain some of the development potential on the Donating
Lot, either in new construction or in existing buildings, the provisions of the
applicable base district and Section 20.90 shall apply to that development.
21.43.3 Dimensional and Use Limitations on the Receiving Lot.
The GFA transferred to a Receiving Lot shall be subject to the following provisions:
1. The transferred GFA shall not be subject to any FAR or GFA limitations applicable to the
Receiving Lot, including lots that already exceed permitted FAR limits.
2. Transferred Non-residential GFA may be used for any use permitted on the Receiving Lot
3. Transferred Residential GFA shall only be used for residential uses on the receiving lot.
4. All other dimensional limitations applicable to the receiving lot shall apply to the transferred
GFA.
5. The total GFA transferred shall not exceed twenty (20%) percent of the GFA otherwise
permitted on the Receiving Lot when the transfer occurs between two or more Overlay
Districts.
21.43.4 Location of Donating and Receiving Lots
21.43.41 Transfer of Development Rights within a Single Overlay District. Transfer of GFA shall be
permitted within the boundaries of a single Overlay District from any Donating Lot to any
Receiving Lot. Where a lot is divided by an Overlay District line, all transferred GFA shall be
located within that portion of the lot located within the Overlay District.
21.43.42 Transfer of Development Rights Between Two or More Overlay Districts. Where it is proposed
to transfer GFA out of one Overlay District into another the following rules shall apply.
1. Overlay Districts 1 and 3 shall contain only Donating Lots. Gross Floor Area from
these Districts may only be transferred to Overlay Districts enumerated in Paragraphs
(2) and (3) below.
2. Overlay Districts 4, 5 and 6 shall contain only Receiving Lots and may receive
transferred GFA only from Overlay Districts 1 and 3.
3. Overlay District 2 shall contain only Receiving Lots and may receive transferred GFA
only from Overlay Districts 1 and 3. However, transferred GFA shall only be permitted
if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that there is in place
a safe and functional pedestrian connection from Overlay District 2 across the railroad
tracts to Overlay District 6; or that the development authorized by a Transfer of
Development Rights Special Permit will provide physical elements or property right
interests that will facilitate the construction of such a pedestrian connection in the
future, to include but not be limited to: fee, easement or other property interest
sufficient to permit the construction of a pedestrian bridge and to permit the general
public access the facility; construction of elements of the bridge on the site or within

22.10 INTENT AND PURPOSE
It is the intent of this Article 22.000 to promote environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient
design and development practices in new construction and renovation of buildings in the city.
Some of the regulations in this Article include design standards that shall be applied to new
construction and renovation projects of a significant size. Other regulations in this Article modify
regulations found elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance in order to encourage the incorporation of
specific design features that will improve the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings.
22.20 GREEN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS
22.21 Statement of Purpose. This Section 22.20 is adopted to ensure that major new projects and
substantially rehabilitated buildings in the City of Cambridge are planned, designed and
constructed in a sustainable way so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts as they are
initially constructed and as they are occupied and operated over the course of their useful lives. It
is the purpose of this Section 22.20 to encourage the reuse of existing buildings and materials; to
encourage the conservation of natural resources and reduction of toxins in new construction and
substantial rehabilitation of existing buildings through selection of recycled and otherwise
environmentally appropriate building materials and methods; to ensure a reduction in the use of
energy in both the initial construction of the project and in its daily operation; and to encourage an
arrangement of buildings and mix of uses, on individual lots and within the city as a whole, that
will foster pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit use in the city. While the provisions of this
section apply to projects of 25,000 square feet or larger, developments of all sizes are
encouraged to incorporate sustainable design principles. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Article 22.00, the requirements of all local, state and/or federal regulations applicable to a project
must be met, particularly the State Building Code, including its energy components.
22.22 Applicability. Any new construction, or any substantial rehabilitation of an existing building for an
existing or new use, that totals 25,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area or more and that (1)
requires the issuance of a special permit under any provision of this Zoning Ordinance (including
but not limited to special permits required in Article 13.000  Planned Unit Development Districts,
Section 19.20  Project Review Special Permit, and Section 5.28.2  Conversion of Non-
Residential Structures to Residential Use) or (2) is subject to the provisions of Section 19.50 
Building and Site Plan Requirements, shall be subject to the requirements of this Section 22.20.

requirements of Section 22.23 above.
22.30 GREEN ROOFS
22.31 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to remove potential impediments to the development of
green roof systems on new and existing buildings by clarifying that such systems should not
count against a buildings Gross Floor Area, and by providing for limited access and enjoyment of
green roofs by occupants of a building.
22.32 Functional Green Roof Area shall be defined as area atop a roof surface on a building, open to
the sky and air, which is surfaced with soil and living plant materials for the purpose of retaining
rainwater and absorbing heat from sunlight. The depth of soil and planted material shall be at
least two (2) inches to be considered Functional Green Roof Area. For the purposes of
maintaining the plant material, Functional Green Roof Area may be accessible by means of a roof
entrance.
22.33 Floor Area Exemptions for Functional Green Roof Area.
22.33.1 Spaces meeting the definition of Functional Green Roof Area as defined in Subsection 22.32
above, which are to be accessed only for maintenance purposes and are not intended to be used
by building occupants or others, shall be exempt from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of a
building.
22.33.2 Spaces meeting the definition of Functional Green Roof Area as defined in Subsection 22.32
above, which are intended to be accessed for use by occupants of the building or others, and
which are located above the third floor of the building, may be exempted from the calculation of
Gross Floor Area of a building only after the granting of a special permit by the Planning Board.
The proponent seeking such a special permit must demonstrate that the Functional Green Roof
Area is designed such that the vegetation will withstand the foot traffic associated with its
anticipated use. The Planning Board shall also consider the potential visual, noise and privacy
impacts of the anticipated use on neighbors. Unless such a special permit is granted, any
Functional Green Roof Area located above the third floor of a building that is intended to be
accessed for use by building occupants or others shall be counted as Gross Floor Area.
22.34 Floor Area Exemptions for Patios or Decks Adjacent to Functional Green Roof Area
22.34.1 In non-residential zoning districts and in Residence C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, and C-3B
zoning districts, where a rooftop surface above the third floor includes Functional Green Roof
Area as defined in Section 22.32 above, adjacent open-air outdoor space intended for use by
building occupants or other persons that does not meet the definition of Functional Green Roof
Area, such as a patio or deck, shall be exempted from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of the
building, provided that the total space exempted in such a manner shall not exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the amount of Functional Green Roof Area on the building and that all such
usable outdoor space shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from all outer roof edges.
22.34.2 In residential zoning districts not listed in Section 22.34.1 above, where a rooftop surface above
the third floor includes Functional Green Roof Area as defined in Section 22.32 above, adjacent
open-air outdoor space intended for use by building occupants or other persons that does not
meet the definition of Functional Green Roof Area, such as a patio or deck, may be exempted
from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of the building only after the granting of a special permit
by the Planning Board. The total space exempted in such a manner shall not exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the amount of Functional Green Roof Area on the building and all such usable
outdoor space shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from all outer roof edges. In granting the
special permit, the Planning Board shall consider the location and orientation of the patio or deck
in relation to adjacent properties and potential visual, noise and privacy impacts of the anticipated
use on abutters.
22.40 EXTERIOR WALLS AND INSULATION
22.41 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to remove potential impediments to the construction of
exterior walls with additional insulation or wall-based mechanical systems that can improve the
energy-efficiency of a building, by exempting the additional gross floor area created by such
features from the calculation of a buildings total Gross Floor Area.
22.42 Double-Skin Facades
22.42.1 A Double-Skin Façade shall be defined as a multilayer exterior wall system comprising a solid
outer wall, a solid inner wall, and a ventilated intermediate air space, intended to improve
insulation and manage solar heat gain as an element of a building-wide mechanical system for
heating and cooling a building.
22.42.2 Floor Area Exemption for Double-Skin Façades. Within an exterior wall system that meets the
definition of a Double-Skin Façade as defined in Section 22.42.1 above, the area occupied by the
intermediate air space shall be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area on a lot, up to a
depth of one (1) foot, provided the space is not to be accessed except for maintenance purposes.
22.43 Exterior Insulation
22.43.1 Floor Area Exemption for Added Exterior Insulation. Where the thickness of a solid, nonremovable
exterior wall of a building is greater than six (6) inches, such wall being comprised
entirely of structural material, insulating material and interior and exterior finishes, any Gross
Floor Area that is further than six (6) inches from the innermost solid plane of the exterior wall
may be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of a building.
22.43.2 Yard Exceptions for Added Exterior Insulation. Existing conforming or pre-existing nonconforming
buildings or buildings that received a building permit prior to August 2, 2010 that
cannot add insulation exterior to the exterior structural wall of the building without intruding into a
required setback may encroach or further encroach into the required yard setback through the
addition of insulation external to the exterior structural wall of the building, provided that the
additional insulation does not increase the thickness of the exterior wall by more than four (4)
inches and that the resulting outermost plane of each exterior wall is no closer than seven feet,
two inches (7-2) to the nearest property line.
22.50 OVERHANGS AND SUN-SHADING DEVICES
22.51 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to remove potential impediments to the addition of
passive solar shading devices intended to reduce the impact of solar heat gain on a building or
lot, by exempting areas underneath such devices from the calculation of Gross Floor Area under
certain circumstances.
22.52 Floor Area Exemption for Sun-Shading Devices. Areas directly underneath a building overhang,
eave, awning or other sun-shading device shall be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor
Area for a lot, provided that the overhang, eave, awning or other sun-shading device extends no
more than three (3) feet from the exterior wall plane of the section of the building beneath it, and
provided that the ground surface directly beneath the overhang, eave, awning or other sunshading
device meets the definition of Permeable Open Space as defined in Article 2 of this
Zoning Ordinance.
22.53 Floor Area Exemption for Pergolas, Arbors and Trellises. Ground space directly underneath an
outdoor pergola, arbor or trellis structure shall be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor
Area of a lot, provided that the structure is at least 80% open to the air across all horizontal or
vertical surfaces, and that any parallel structural support members with a cross-section of greater
than one (1) inch by two (2) inches are separated from each other by at least three (3) feet on
center. These features may be freestanding or attached to a building.
22.60 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS
22.61 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to define solar energy systems within the zoning
ordinance, to provide a mechanism for publicly registering such systems so that nearby
developers can be aware of their existence, and to provide limited zoning protections for such
systems in some instances where developers of neighboring properties are seeking a special
permit or variance.
22.62.1 Solar energy systems are viewed as potentially valuable contributors to meeting the Citys
objective of encouraging sustainable development and energy conservation. However, the
complex nature of urban development in the city limits the extent to which the citys zoning
regulations can be employed to guarantee long-term access to sunlight on a wide geographic
basis. Therefore, the following provisions are intended to provide limited support for such systems
and to raise awareness of their contribution to the objectives of this Article 22.000 on the part of
the general public and property owners.
22.62 A Solar Energy System shall be defined as a device or combination of equipment that converts
radiant energy from the sun into heat or electricity that can be used for the purpose of heating
indoor spaces, producing hot water, or powering electrical devices.
22.63 A Registered Solar Energy System shall be defined as a Solar Energy System for which a
building permit has been issued, provided that at least one year has passed since the issuance of
such permit, and whose sun-exposed elements are at a height no lower than five (5) feet below
the maximum height allowed within the base zoning district in which it is located. Such systems
shall be recorded on a public registry of Solar Energy Systems that shall be maintained by the
Citys Inspectional Services Department and made available to property owners by request.
22.64 Protection of Registered Solar Energy Systems. The impacts of a proposed development seeking
a special permit or variance on a Registered Solar Energy System shall be considered by the
Board of Zoning Appeal or the Planning Board, whichever is applicable, in making its
determination, as described in Article 10, Subsection 10.32 and Article 19, Subsection 19.33 of
this Zoning Ordinance. No protection shall be provided by this Zoning Ordinance to a Solar
Energy System that does not meet the definition of a Registered Solar Energy System.
22.70 WIND TURBINE SYSTEMS
22.71 Purpose. It is the intent of this Section 22.70 to permit the limited use of wind turbines throughout
the city (a) for the purpose of small scale generation of electricity for on-site consumption as an
accessory use to other activities located on the same lot, (b) for the purpose of researching,
testing, evaluating, or demonstration of the efficacy in an urban setting of such instruments as a
means by which renewable sources of energy might be employed to generate electricity at a
larger scale for both a domestic and commercial purposes, and (c) in appropriate locations in non
residential districts for the generation of electricity for commercial sale as a principal use. These
provisions are intended to ensure that such facilities are well designed, carefully sited, and
operated in a manner that will not pose a nuisance or hazard to the general public or nearby
neighbors.
22.72 Wind Turbine Systems Permitted by Special Permit.
A Wind Turbine System may generally be permitted anywhere in the city after the granting of a
special permit from the Planning Board, subject to the conditions and limitations described in this
Subsection 22.72. In special cases, there is a limited provision for the permitting of Wind Turbine
Systems as-of-right, without the granting of a special permit, as described in Subsection 22.73
below.
22.72.1 Dimensional Limitations.
1. Height. There shall be no maximum height limit for a Wind Turbine, but the permitted height of a
Wind Turbine shall be specifically approved by the Planning Board.
2. Setbacks. There shall be no required minimum yard setbacks for a Wind Turbine, but the
permitted placement of a Wind Turbine with respect to public street lines and adjacent lot lines
shall be specifically approved by the Planning Board. All equipment and structures accessory to
the Wind Turbine shall be subject to the yard requirements of the applicable zoning district unless
waived by the Planning Board.
22.72.2 Application Material.
At a minimum the special permit application shall contain the following material:
1. Plans of the site showing the location of the Wind Turbine System and its relationship to other
uses and buildings on the site, including elevations of Wind Turbines and other features on
the site; plans, descriptions, illustrations and/or photographs describing the surrounding uses
and physical context in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of the proposal on those
surrounding activities; illustration of the laydown options for maintenance of the equipment;
any proposed screening and landscaping.
2. A detailed description of the Wind Turbine System including number, size, materials, noise
rating, operational plan, maintenance schedule.
3. A narrative discussion of the extent to which the operation of the proposed Wind Turbine
System will generate continuous shadows, intermittent shadows (a.k.a. flicker), and/or noise
that may be detected from adjacent properties and from the public street.
4. Photo simulations or other representations, from at least two vantage points (one of which
should be from a public street), illustrating the proposal in its physical context.
5. A detailed estimate of the cost of removal of the Wind Turbine System.
22.72.3 Standards for Granting of the Special Permit.
In addition to the limitations requirements described in Section 22.74 below and the criteria
established in Section 10.43 of the Zoning Ordinance for the granting of a special permit, the
Planning Board shall consider the following specific criteria.
1. The visual impact of the Wind Turbine System on the abutting properties and the
neighborhood. In recognition of the fact that a Wind Turbine of any significant size will
introduce a physical structure and form not typical of most residential and commercial
neighborhoods in the city, the Planning Board shall consider the following when assessing
whether a proposal has any unreasonable negative impacts on neighborhood character or
adjacent uses:
a. the size, scale and bulk of the proposed Wind Turbine System in relationship to the scale
of typical buildings and other elements in the neighborhood;
b. the visibility and impact of the proposed Wind Turbine System from important view
corridors and viewsheds, with the understanding that reasonable efforts should be made
to make the system visually unobtrusive, although in many cases a system may not be
reasonably expected to be screened from public view;
c. the nature of adjacent uses, including the historical and architectural quality of
surrounding buildings, the consistency of that architectural character over an extended
area, and the extent to which the proposed Wind Turbine System is visually integrated
with that character and with the larger urban landscape; and
d. in the case of building-mounted Wind Turbine Systems, the visual relationship between
the system and the architecture of the building upon which it is installed.
2. The extent, frequency and duration of continuous and intermittent shadows and their
relationship to interior spaces and places people will regularly occupy. Such impacts should
be minimized and directed away from sensitive spaces in residential environments. It shall be
the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that there shall be no significant adverse impact
on adjacent properties.
3. The extent of detectable noise and vibration impact on neighboring uses.
4. Where a Wind Turbine System is proposed in an Open Space District or near an open space
facility, particularly one with a significant natural aspect, the systems impact on any
conservation, historic, or recreational value should be carefully analyzed.
5. Other factors with regard to the operational and visual impacts of the Wind Turbine System
that may suggest that a time limitation should be imposed on the special permit.
22.73 Wind Turbine Systems Permitted As-of-right.
A Wind Turbine System shall be permitted as-of-right, without the granting of a special permit,
only if the conditions and limitations of this Subsection 22.73 and the requirements of Subsection
22.74 below are met. Any proposed Wind Turbine System not meeting all of the conditions and
limitations of this Subsection 22.73 may be permitted only after the granting of a special permit by
the Planning Board, as described in Subsection 22.72 above.
22.73.1 District Limitations.
The Wind Turbine System and all associated monitoring and testing equipment must be located
in a Residence C-3, C-3A, C-3B or Special District 6 zoning district.
22.73.2 Use Limitations.
1. The Wind Turbine System must be accessory to an educational use, Section 4.56 c,
Paragraphs 4-6, dormitory use accessory to such educational use, Section 4.56 c, Paragraph
8, or museum use, Section 4.56 i, Paragraph 2 where such museum has as its core mission
the display, exploration and dissemination of knowledge, scientific principles, and natural
phenomena to the general public.
2. The Wind Turbine System shall only be installed for the purpose of advancing the educational
and instructional purposes of the institution to which it is accessory and shall not be installed
for the specific and principal purpose of generating electricity for sale. However, energy
generated by the Wind Turbine System may be used in the operation of the physical plant of
the institution to which it is accessory.
22.73.3 Dimensional Limitations.
1. The Wind Turbine must be installed on a building and may not be a freestanding structure.
2. Height: The Wind Turbine Height may not extend more than forty (40) feet above the existing
height of the portion of the building upon which it is mounted. Such limitation shall apply
even if the height of the building is non-conforming and already exceeds the height of
structures permitted in the zoning district. The height shall be measured to the highest point
of the turbine, including the height of blades when in the vertical position.
3. Setbacks. The Wind Turbine shall be subject to the following minimum setbacks, which shall
apply regardless of the location of the building upon which the turbine is installed.
a. No portion of the Wind Turbine may be located nearer than two hundred (200)
feet to any structure containing a residential use (exclusive of transient
residential uses, Section 4.31 i) that is neither owned nor under the control of the
institution erecting the turbine.
b. The minimum setback of the Wind Turbine from any public street line or from a
lot line of a lot not in the ownership of the institution to which the Wind Turbine is
accessory shall be a distance equal to the Wind Turbine Height. However, a
Wind Turbine with a height of ten (10) feet or less shall have no required
minimum setback.
22.73.4 Time Limitations
A building permit authorizing the installation of a Wind Turbine System under the provisions of
this Subsection 22.73 shall limit said use to a period not to exceed two years unless, prior to
expiration of said two years, a request in writing is submitted to the Inspectional Services
Department for an extension of the permit for an additional two years. Such extension shall not be
unreasonably withheld and may be granted if the conditions and requirements of this Subsection
22.73 and Subsection 22.74 below continue to be met by the Wind Turbine System and no
nuisance or hazard has been identified during the previous two years of operation. Such building
permit may be extended for additional two year intervals in the same manner.
22.74 General Limitations and Requirements for Wind Turbine Systems
22.74.1 In all cases, a Wind Turbine System shall be subject to the following limitations and requirements:
1. The Wind Turbine System shall be free from any appurtenances with the exception of
equipment necessary to monitor, regulate, secure, and maintain the system and the
electricity it may produce. No sign may be attached to the system with the exception of
unobtrusive manufacturer identification and operational guidance informational signs. No
cellular or mobile phone equipment may be attached to the system.
2. The Wind Turbine System shall not be independently lighted except as may be required by
any local, state or federal regulation.
3. The Wind Turbine System shall be painted in subdued tones of white, black, silver, grey, dark
green, brown, blue or similarly subdued, non-reflective color unless otherwise required by
local, state and/or federal regulations or allowed by the Planning Board.
4. In operation the Wind Turbine System shall meet the requirements of the Cambridge Noise
Ordinance, cumulatively for all equipment installed at a single location. All equipment shall be
rated for noise generation so that it can be evaluated prior to installation.
5. The site shall be capable of accommodating the laydown of the Wind Turbine without
trespass onto city streets or adjacent lots held in a different ownership.
6. The Wind Turbine System shall be designed and located so as to prevent unauthorized
access and otherwise be maintained in a safe operating condition.
7. Abandonment. Given the unique safety considerations associated with Wind Turbines, the
owner shall be obligated to remove the Wind Turbine System if any one of the following
occurs:
a. abandonment of the Wind Turbine System through disuse for a period of one year;
b. non-functioning of the Wind Turbine System for more than 100 days, where
substantial steps have not been initiated to make necessary repairs; or
c. failure to request an extension of a building permit as required in Subsection 22.73.4
above, or a special permit authorized under Subsection 22.72 above, where that
special permit may have been time-limited by the Planning Board.
Upon failure to remove the Wind Turbine System 150 days after any one of these threshold
events occurs, the City of Cambridge shall have the authority to enter the property and
remove the system at the expense of the owner/operator where it finds that the equipment
constitutes a hazard to the general public. At or before issuance of a building permit for the
system, the Permittee shall post a bond or other surety in a form and in an amount
acceptable to the City that shall cover the cost of removal of the system by the City should
that be necessary, such bond amount to be consistent with estimates for removal prepared at
the Permittees expense by a qualified engineer. The surety mechanism shall account for
cost of living adjustments over the expected life of the system.
8. A Wind Turbine System principally used for the express purpose of the commercial selling of
the energy generated shall be permitted only in non-residential zoning districts. In residential
districts, such commercial use is shall not be permitted. However, it is understood that in
those residential districts a portion of the energy generated by the system that is not
immediately consumed on-site may at times be sold back or credited to the local-serving
power utility, consistent with any applicable state or federal law or regulation. Furthermore, a
cooperative system serving multiple adjacent properties shall be permitted in residential
districts and may share the output of the system without being considered a commercial use.
22.74.2 Waiver of Requirements
When granting a special permit for a Wind Turbine System, the Planning Board may grant a

22.75 Definitions
22.75.1 Wind Turbine. A device that converts wind energy to rotational energy that then drives an
electrical generator. A conventional turbine generally consists of a tower or pole, a nacelle body,
and a rotor with multiple blades. Variations may include vertical axis turbines and structural
elements housing and encapsulating the rotating elements of the turbine. It is anticipated that as
testing and experimentation continues the physical form of turbines may become much more
varied.
22.75.2 Wind Turbine System. A combination of equipment designed to be permanently mounted on a
building or freestanding, including Wind Turbines and associated and accessory equipment and
structures, necessary to convert wind energy to electricity.
22.75.3 Wind Turbine Height. The vertical dimension of a Wind Turbine as measured from ground level in
the case of a freestanding turbine, or from the height of the portion of the building upon which it is
mounted in the case of a building-mounted turbine, to the highest point of the Wind Turbine,
including the height of blades when in the vertical position.
