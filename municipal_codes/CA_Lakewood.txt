F. The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month.

The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper apportionment of taxable and non­ taxable charges. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable and non-taxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper valuation of the taxable and non-taxable services.
2926. SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS. For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under Part 2 of this Chapter, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the communication users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the City, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under Part 2 of this Chapter. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the City for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the City, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the City by employees, independent contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in the City on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the City or distributed from a location with the City; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and published within the City or through materials distributed in the City by means other than the United States mail; or if there are activities performed in the City on behalf of the service supplier that are significantly associated with the service supplier's ability to establish and maintain a market in the City for the provision of services that are subject to a tax under this Chapter.

Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share ofboth the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 2931 shall apply.
2. The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of Part 2 of this Chapter. Where a service user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

2929. ACTIONS TO COLLECT. Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of Part 2 of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of Part 2 of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in Part 2 of this Chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person's noncompliance with Part 2 of this Chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees.

Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent.

Likewise, prior to April 1, 2009, any person who pays the tax levied pursuant to Section 2904 of Part 1 of this Chapter with respect to any charge for a telephone users service shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to Section 2924 of Part 2 of this Chapter with respect to that charge. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during the transition period from the prior telephone users' tax to the new communication users' tax (which transition period ends April 1, 2009) and to permit communications service providers, during that transition period to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.

In the event that a final court order should determine that the election enacting this Article II, Chapter 9, Part 2 is invalid for whatever reason, or that any tax imposed under this Article II, Chapter 9, Part 2 is invalid in whole or in part, then the tax imposed under Section 2904 of Part 1of this Chapter (unless repealed) shall automatically continue to apply with respect to any service for which the tax levied pursuant to Section 2924 of Part 2 of this Chapter has been determined to be invalid. Such automatic continuation shall be effective beginning as of the first date of service (or billing date) for which the tax imposed by Section 2924 of Part 2 of this Chapter is not valid. However, in the event of an invalidation, any tax (other than a tax that is ordered refunded by the court or is otherwise refunded by the City) paid by a person with respect to a service and calculated pursuant to Section 2924 of Part 2 of this Chapter shall be deemed to satisfy the tax imposed under Section 2904 of Part 1 of this Chapter on that service, so long as the tax is paid with respect to a service provided no later than six months subsequent to the date on which the final court order is published.
2941.   REMEDIES  CUMULATIVE.
All remedies and penalties prescribed by Part 2 of this Chapter or which are available under any other provision of law or equity, including but not limited to the California False Claims Act (Government Code Section 12650 et seq.) and the California Unfair Practices Act (Business and Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Part 2 of this Chapter."

4238. PUBLIC NUDITY PROHIBITED.
A.	PURPOSE. The City Council, in enacting this Section, has considered the appeals of the great majority of Lakewood residents that the City Council prohibit nudity in public places. The City Council, after reviewing this matter, finds that the appearance of people in the nude in a public place or in a place open to, or visible by, the public is inimical to public order, decency and morality. The prohibition of nudity has been analyzed and regulations of other jurisdictions considered. In Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., (1991) 115 L.Ed.2d 504, the United States Supreme Court held that nude dancing and entertainment is expressive conduct within the outer parameters of the First Amendment, and inasmuch as such expression was within the outer parameters of the First Amendment, an Indiana Statute prohibiting nudity in public places to protect morals and the public order furthered a substantial governmental interest, and its effect on the First Amendment was only an incidental limitation. The Court held that as long as the Statute was narrowly drawn and was not intended to regulate erotic dancing protected under the First Amendment but rather public nudity, the same was a valid police power regulation. As used in this Section, "Open to the Public" has reference to the decision of the California Court of Appeals in Demott v. Board of Public Commissioners, 1981, 122 Cal.App.3d 296, 175
Cal.Rptr. 879.
B.	PUBLIC NUDITY: PROHIBITED. It is unlawful for any person within the City of Lakewood, while in any public park, playground, public right-of-way, or in any other public place or public accommodation, or in any place open to the public or obviously open to public view (with or without payment of an admission fee) to knowingly and intentionally:
1.	Expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum, anal region or pubic hair regions; or
2.	Use any device, costume or covering which gives the appearance or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum, anal region or pubic hair region; or
3.	Expose the nipples and/or areolae of the female breasts except as necessary while breastfeeding an infant under two (2) years of age; or
4. Use any device (commonly known as a pasty or pasties) worn as a cover over the nipples and/or areolae of the female breasts, which device simulates and gives the realistic appearance of nipples and/or areolae.
C.	EXEMPTIONS. The prohibitions of this Section shall not apply to:
1.	Any child under ten (10) years of age; or
2.	Any act prohibited, or the prohibition of which is preempted by any provision of State law; or
3.	Any theater, concert hall, auditorium or similar establishment devoted to theatrical performances. The phrase "theater, concert hall, auditorium or similar establishment devoted to theatrical performances" shall mean a building, playhouse, room, hall or other place having fixed seats so arranged that a body of spectators can have an unobstructed view of the stage upon which theatrical performances or similar forms of artistic expression are presented.
4. Entertainment places for which a permit is required under Section 6402.G. and provided such a permit is obtained and maintained during all times.
(Added by Ord. 94-8)

B.	PUBLIC PLACE. "Public place" shall mean a place in which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, and includes, but is not limited to, any street, highway, sidewalk, parking lot, commercial or business area, theaters, places of amusement, park, or playground.

A.

This protection is necessary to protect children from harmful material as hereinafter provided in this section. The City Council finds that exposure to such material is a matter of parental control or education through school or church or professional facilities designed to educate minors about sexual conduct.

B.	Nothing contained in the aforementioned Paragraph A shall be deemed to prohibit the display of indecent, or harmful, or obscene material, except as prohibited by the Cali{Ornia Penal Code, to persons over eighteen (18) attending an internet access studio. The City Council finds that there is no intent in enacting this section to sensor, prohibit or oversee material legally accessible to adults through the internet.
C.	A proprietor of an internet access studio, or employee or agent thereof, shall only allow a minor to attend said studio where the minor produces a parental consent or control card in the form approved by the City unless said minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian. Failure of any access studio proprietor or manager or employee to require such a card from a minor unless accompanied by a parent or guardian is unlawful. Any minor found on the premises without such a parental access card unless accompanied by a parent or guardian shall be immediately ordered to leave the premises, and failure to do so by any adult employee of the studio is unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to remain in or in the vicinity of an internet access studio when ordered to leave the same by a person in charge or a law enforcement officer.
A proprietor of an internet access studio shall maintain at all times a sign in the form approved by the City on
all doors providing access thereto that minors are not allowed unless accompanied by a parent or guardian or have a parental access card.
D.	The provisions of Paragraph Care inapplicable to any owner or operator of an internet access studio who, as a condition to the granting of a conditional use permit, agrees to the following additional conditions:
1.	A sign shall be posted and maintained at all times on all doors giving access to the studio stating in effect that "no adult materials are allowed to be accessed on the premises."
2.	The proprietor agrees to install and maintain at all times in each computer to which anyone has access software or other device that will filter or block out adult materials as defined in Paragraph A. The type of filter or software adopted shall be in the discretion of the proprietor of the premises subject only to the City's inspection to determine whether applying the most recent state of the art that said filter or device reasonably blocks out the obnoxious material defined in Paragraph A. The City Council finds, determines and orders that any City officer or employee in reviewing the software or device used to block out the undesirable materials shall be without discretion to determine what is obnoxious or obscene, and the sole function of the City Officer or employee shall be to determine whether or not the software or device reasonably blocks out the activity described in Paragraph A. The City Council finds that it is aware that this is a growing state of the art and the device and may not be effective in all cases, but City officers and employees shall require the proprietor to obtain the most reasonable and effective devices available at a reasonable charge.

CHAPTER6
CHARGES  FOR EXTRAORDINARY  LAW ENFORCEMENT  SERVICES
(Added by Ord. 89-4)

4600. PURPOSES. It is the intent of the City Council by the adoption of this Chapter to impose on and collect from the person in charge or responsible for an event that generates extraordinary cost to the City over and above the cost of providing normal law enforcement services and police protection city wide. The events for which charges are imposed are those voluntarily elected by the person responsible for the services, or his or her parent, guardian or the person having custody of a minor, and as hereinafter defined. The purpose of this chapter is to recover the actual cost to the City, over and above the cost to the City in providing police services, and law enforcement services to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The City Council finds that because of the limitations of various State Constitutional provisions, the pre-emption by the State and Federal government of the right of local agencies to impose taxes for the general welfare, it is necessary that persons voluntarily incurring special and extraordinary police services pay to the City the reasonable cost of providing such services.

MUNICIPAL  COLLECTION  OF REFUSE
(Added by Ord. 76-7)

5320. COLLECTION OF REFUSE. Except as authorized by §5322 and this Chapter, no person other than the City or its Contractor shall gather, collect or remove any refuse from a place or premise within the City. (Amended by Ord. 96-3)
	SAME; HOUSEHOLDERS' EXCLUSION. Householders hauling occasional loads of refuse or manure, not containing garbage, from their own premises to a legal point of disposal shall be excepted from the provision of this part.
	SAME; GARDENERS' EXCLUSION. This part shall not apply to the hauling, removal or disposal at a legal point of disposal of grass cuttings, prunings, manure or other trash as a result of gardening or horticulture.
5321. REFUSE. FINDINGS. The City Council finds that an exclusive municipal system for the collection of all refuse is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare; that the periodic collection of refuse from all places in the City benefits all occupants of places and premises in the City; that inasmuch as charges are to be assessed for the collection of refuse, it is necessary that said charges be assessed to the occupants of all premises where refuse is produced or generated, regardless of whether the occupant places such refuse for collection in a manner prescribed in this part or not, and regardless of whether the occupant has any refuse for collection, to the end that all persons will place refuse generated or produced on the premises that they occupy for collection in the manner prescribed in this chapter and to the end that the accumulation or scattering of refuse is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and the cost of removal thereof should be shared by all persons.
	SAME. The City Council further finds as follows:
A.	That while there is some variation in the amount of refuse produced at a single family residential location, or a multiple family residential location, such deviation does not justify the expense of measuring the quantities at such residential locations because the expense of measuring quantities at such residential locations would be greater than the extra cost of hauling additional quantities of refuse from a few residential locations in the City.
B.	The amount of refuse produced at places of business varies greatly. The most equitable method of charging for collecting refuse at these locations is based on the amount of refuse produced or generated, the related basis of size and number of containers required for the collection of refuse, and upon differing schedules and regularity of collection.
5322. EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF COLLECTION. The City Council finds and determines that a governmental function of the City shall be to provide refuse collection to all places and premises within the City. It shall be the duty and responsibility of each occupant or person in charge of any place or premise within the City to provide for refuse disposal in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Chapter. Refuse disposal shall mean placing all refuse within the time and manner required by this Chapter in containers or bins as herein required for disposal by the City or its Contractor. Refuse so placed for disposal shall become the property of the City or its Contractor and no person other than the City or its Contractor shall remove any refuse so placed for disposal. Nothing herein contained however shall prevent the owner or occupier of any place or premise from selling recyclable materials as defined in the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 as amended from time to time to anyone for a valuable consideration. This section is intended to incorporate and comply with the decision of the California Supreme Court in the case of Waste Management of the Desert, Inc. vs. Palm Springs Recycling Center, Inc., filed March 31, 1994, wherein the court adopts the view that the selling of materials for other use or recycling is distinguishable from the discarding of refuse.  (Added by Ord. 96-3)
Nothing herein contained however shall prevent the owner or occupier of any place or premises from contracting for the removal and disposal of recyclable construction and demolition debris, as defined in Section 5314, by those contractors licensed by Article VI of the Lakewood Municipal Code.

CHAPTERS
SMOKING REGULATED  OR PROHIBITED
(Added by Ord. 88-12)
(Parts 1 through 4 Suspended by Section 5550)

PART I LEGISLATIVE  FINDINGS

5500. FINDINGS.  The City Council hereby find s:
A.	Based upon the United States Surgeon General's Report on health consequences of second-hand tobacco smoke the medical community has generally concluded that non-smokers subjected to tobacco smoke are at risk for the development of lung cancer. In addition there are other serious health consequences including respiratory malfunctions and irritation that may result from inhaling tobacco smoke .
B. Non-smokers should have a right to be free from exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke from those who use tobacco.
C.     The California Legislature by the California Indoor Clean Air Act of 1976, California Health and Safety Code
25940 et. seq. has found and declared that tobacco is a hazard to the health of the general public and although the State Legislature by the aforementioned act has adopted some regulations pertaining to smoking in places of public assembly, health facilities , restaurants , retail food establishments , elevators and public conveyances , many other places where the public congregate as well as retail stores, work places and other facilities are without any regulation.
D.  The City Council concurs in the findings of the California Legislature and the United States Surgeon  General and in addition finds that the California Indoor Clean Air Act of 1976, as amended , should be expanded by local regulation not in consistent with the provisions thereof and as authorized by Health and Safety Code 25946 and 25949 .6.
E.     Based on the aforementioned findings, the City Council should adopt a non-smoking policy applicable to all City
owned and maintained facilities and vehicles.
F.	In addition based upon the aforementioned findings , the City Council should by ordinance regulate the smoking of tobacco in any enclosure or building in the City where the public is invited to attend as defined in Chapter 3 of Article IX as churches, educational institutions , public libraries and museums , hospitals , convalescent homes and sanitariums (except where authorized by a medical order), retail sales facilities, cafe, food and restaurant facilities, private clubhouses and commercial recreation buildings, anywhere in the City as well as within all building enclosures in any of the commercial or manufacturing zones of the city . As a minimum the regulation should require the owner, proprietor or manager of the foregoing to adopt a non-smoking policy and to post said premise s with notices or warnings that smoking is either allowed , prohibited or allowed only in designated areas.
G.	The City Council further finds that the regulations herein enacted are not within the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act in that the effect of this Ordinance is to have a beneficial effect on the public health , safety and welfare rather than an adverse effect and therefore this Ordinance is not a project under CEQA.
5501. INTENT. The City Council does not intend by the provisions of this Chapter to allow or permit what  is now prohibited by the California Indoor Clean Air Act of 1976, Section 25940 et. seq. of the California Health and Safety Code . The City Council does intend by this Ordinance to enact additional and more strict regulation than those found in the California Indoor Clean Air Act of 1976 in order to protect the public health , safety and welfare as well as non-smokers who otherwise may be exposed to the deleterious effect of tobacco smoke.

6.	Standards. No permit shall be granted under this section unless it is found that:
(a)	The operation as proposed by the applicant, if permitted would comply with all applicable laws, including but not limited to the City's Zoning, Building, Health Regulations, and Fire Regulations.
(b)	That the applicant, and any other person who will be directly engaged in the management and operation of the place of entertainment, other than the one who participates in the act of entertainment:
(1)	Has not been convicted in a Court of Competent jurisdiction by final judgment of an offense involving the presentation, exhibition or performance of an obscene production, motion picture, play or act, or an offense involving the use of force and violence upon the person of another, or an offense involving misconduct with children.
(c) The applicant and any other person who will directly engage in the management and operation of the place of entertainment has not knowingly made any false, misleading or fraudulent statement of facts in the permit application, or any other document filed with the City in the preceding five years in connection with any license or permit application.
(d) The applicant, where an entertainer, has not been convicted in a Court of competent jurisdiction by a final judgment of an offense involving lewd conduct, or an offense involving the presentation, exhibition or performance of an obscene production, motion picture, play or act or an offense involving use of force and violence upon the person of another, or an offense involving misconduct with children.
(e) That the operation, if permitted, would not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare by reason of noise and traffic interfering with the quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the surrounding neighborhood. This subsection shall be narrowly applied. There must be a finding that from experience as indicated from this or similar uses the amount of noise, traffic and congregation of persons in, to and from said business will substantially interfere with the health or safety or welfare or enjoyment of other persons or businesses in the vicinity. Where the business establishment is in close proximity to residential areas, schools, churches, parks and public buildings, this factor must be given more weight than it would be in a general business district not in close proximity to residential areas, schools, churches, parks and public buildings.  (Amended by Ord 94-8)
(f) That adequate and convenient off-street parking is available to support the proposed entertainment and patrons and customers likely to be attracted thereto in reasonable safety, and without undue congestion, noise and without adversely affecting the peace and quiet and normal enjoyment of the surrounding neighborhood. The City Council finds that the zoning requirements for off-street parking for commercial uses were not enacted or adopted with this type of entertainment and congestion contemplated, and therefore each place of business with the type of entertainment contemplated, the size thereof, and its general location as well as available off-street parking, must be separately considered notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary.
(g) That necessary police manpower is available to police said premises and the entertainment and the method of conducting the same, under reasonable conditions, will not place an unreasonable burden on the Law Enforcement Agency of the City so as to endanger the public peace, health, safety or welfare. If this finding cannot be made, the permit shall be issued under a condition that the permittee arrange for additional law enforcement services as determined reasonably necessary by a written report of the Chief of the law enforcement agency.  (Amended by Ord 94-8)
(h)	All such entertainment shall be presented within a building and no such entertainment shall be visible at any time from any ground, parking lot, sidewalk, street, highway, alley or from any point outside or exterior of such building.
(i)	The building within which said entertainment is provided is of adequate size, design and construction to safely house the patrons and guests likely to be attracted to said premises by reason of said entertainment.

6529.    LIMITATIONS.	All taxes heretofore levied pursuant to this Chapter in addition to the aforementioned limitations, and, in particular, Sections 6504-6507, shall be subject to the following additional limitations:
A.	INTENT. In enacting this ordinance as a revenue measure, the City Council has established and set the aforementioned fees as a reasonable exercise of its power to levy taxes, and based upon a classification that is reasonable. In doing so the City has prepared the aforementioned tax schedule and procedure for levying taxes on the basis of an occurrence of a taxable event within the City, and it is only taxable events within the City that are subject to taxation. In that regard, any fixed place of business is a taxable event within the City. Those persons doing business within the City and having a fixed place of business outside the City also are subject to taxation as provided in the aforementioned schedule on the basis of the occurrence of a taxable event within the City. Such events include, but are not limited by, manufacturing, construction, services, selling, deliveries, and like activities.
 

B.	GROSS  RECEIPTS.
1.	Where the taxable event is selling within the City the percentage of gross receipts subject to taxation shall be apportioned based on the selling activities and taxable events occurring within the City. Where the sale occurs within the City it shall be reported as a taxable event within the City, and subject to taxation.
2.	A business established outside the City but maintaining a branch office or store within the City or doing business within the City through an agent, broker or employee, shall report as gross receipts its total sales and receipts attributable to the local branch office store, agent, broker or employee.
3.	Gross receipts for real estate brokers or agents, travel agents, insurance brokers and bail bond brokers shall mean the total gross commissions of the foregoing having a fixed place of business within the City and, if not, of the sales or taxable events of the foregoing events within the City.
6530. INTER-CITY TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be deemed to levy a business license tax upon the inter-city transportation business of any express corporation, freight forwarder, motor transportation broker, or person or corporation, not having a fixed place of business within the City, and transporting goods, wares or merchandise through the City where both the original point and destination point of such transported property are not within the boundaries of the City.
6531. BOUNDARY LINE BUSINESSES. Any person conducting a business located partially within the City and partially within another City and having its place of address or the principal place of conducting or administering said business in another City, shall nevertheless be subject to taxation under this Chapter. It is the intent of the City Council by this Chapter to require all persons doing business within the City to pay a tax based on a taxable event within the City, and where that event is divided by reason of City boundary lines, or the principal or administrative office of the business or the mailing address of the business is located within another City by the fortuitous geographical setting thereof, but said business is a continuous enterprise crossing the boundary lines of the City of Lakewood and another city, all activities of said business whether actually performed within the City of Lakewood shall be considered for the purpose of taxation under this Chapter business activities within the City of Lakewood. At the same time it is the intent of the City Council to apply the apportionment theory as set forth in Los Angeles vs. Shell, ( 1971), 4 C. (3) 108, and General Motors vs. Los Angeles, (1971), 5 C. (3) 229, wherein gross receipt business license taxes were apportioned based on the taxable events occurring within the City. Therefore in the event any person conducts business for which a tax would be imposed and a tax certificate required by this Chapter, but for the fact that only a portion thereof is located within the City of Lakewood by reason of City boundary lines, said person shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter, and a tax shall be levied and paid all subject to the terms and provisions of this Chapter on said business activities, but shall be apportioned at a percentage thereof ofless than 100% levied and collected based upon the number of taxable events occurring within the City, the frequency of said events, the continuity of said events, and the percentage of income or sales derived from said events. Taxable events as used hereunder include construction, manufacturing, repair, overhaul, storage, delivery, selling, and business administrative offices. The Director of Finance shall determine said apportionment and application of the aforementioned principles and may adopt and promulgate from time to time reasonable guidelines consistent with the aforementioned principles which shall be uniformly applied in all cases. The determination of the Director of Finance for the adoption of any such guidelines shall be subject to review and appeal by and to the City Council in accordance with and subject to the same procedure as set forth in Section 6514.

In case, such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

(15)	days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 6911. RECORDS. It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
6912. REFUNDS.
A.	Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City under this Chapter it may be refunded as provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
B.	An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subparagraph (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.
6913. ACTIONS TO COLLECT. Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
 

6914. VIOLATIONS; MISDEMEANOR. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in this Code.

Because of the erection of many new housing units include multiple family units and the growth of commercial and industrial establishments, the population density of the City of Lakewood is greatly increased with the result that the city sewerage system is no longer adequate in all parts of the City to accomplish the increased volume of sewage generated by such development. Detailed studies and findings of this fact are contained in a Sanitary Sewer System Study prepared by the City Engineer on file in the Office of the Director of Public Works. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a charge to be collected from the owners of such property proposing to discharge, to the public sewer quantities of sewage in excess of the quantity for which the existing sewerage system was designed; and to establish a Fund into which these charges may be deposited and from which money will be available for the city's  sewer reconstruction program.

The sewer reconstruction program shall be carried out basically in accordance with the City of Lakewood's Sewer Reconstruction Plan contained in the report of the City Engineer entitled "Sanitary Sewer System Study," as updated May 10, 1973, and on file in the office of the Director of Public Works. If compliance with the reconstruction plan is impossible or impractical because of peculiar or unforeseen conditions, and the purposes of this Chapter may be accomplished and the public health and safety assured by alternate construction, the City Council may from time to time grant exceptions to the Reconstruction Plan by motion permitting such alternate construction. In addition, the City Engineer shall periodically review the Sewer Reconstruction Plan and report to the City Council any proposed changes in said Plan which may hereafter be adopted and approved by the City Council by motion. 7303. PUBLIC SEWER. "Public sewer" or "City sewerage system" or "City sewers," as used in this Chapter, shall mean a mainline sanitary sewer, dedicated to public use, but excepting therefrom sewers under the jurisdiction of a public entity other than the City of Lakewood.
7304. TRIBUTARY AREA. "Tributary Area" shall mean all that area outside the boundaries of the City of Lakewood that would, as determined by an area study approved by the City Engineer, normally drain or can economically be made to drain sewage into a public sewer within the boundaries of the City of Lakewood.

Any occupancy not contained within the aforementioned classification shall be rated by the City Engineer at a peak flow based upon any aforementioned classified occupancy it most nearly resembles. Until the City Council, based upon further engineering studies, determines excessive peak flow discharge for single family residential property, all single family residential property shall be classified at 600 gallons per day per dwelling unit, provided, however, any single family classification, having in addition to a single family use on each 5,000 square feet of lot area an accessory use discharging sewage to the public sewer, shall be classified for the purpose of this Chapter as a multiple dwelling.
The peak flow to the sanitary sewer for a building containing mixed occupancies shall be determined by adding the
peak flow characteristics of the various occupancies as set forth in the above table.
 

7331. CHARGES. The aforementioned Table of peak flows is based upon the Sanitary System Study prepared by the City Engineer using engineering criteria and mathematical formulae in determining the existing sewer capacity, needed sewer reconstruction by discharge over and above existing sewer capacity, and the cost and scheduling thereof. As the result of said study, the City Council hereby finds and determines that the total cost of reconstruction as set forth in said Sewer Plan will be at the rate of 15 cents per gallon per day of additional peak flow in excess of 600 gallons, which rate shall be modified periodically to reflect any change of lot area per day shall be used in determining the charge to be imposed for the purpose of this Part at the rate of 15 cents per gallon per day.
7332. CHARGES FOR TRIBUTARY AREAS. The applicant for a permit to connect any tributary area to a public sewer shall declare all information necessary, as determined by the City Engineer, to comply with the provisions of this Chapter, and shall pay the rate provided herein, excluding credit specified in Section 5073.3, provided that the City Engineer determines there is sufficient capacity available or can be made available in the public sewers to serve the anticipated development. Any area study to determine capacity shall be made by the City Engineer, or by a registered Engineer under his approval, and the cost thereof shall be borne by the applicant.
If sufficient capacity is not available or cannot be made available in the public sewer, said connection may not be made unless otherwise authorized by the City Council.
7333. SEWER RECONSTRUCTION FUND. The charges collected under this Chapter shall be credited to the Sewer Reconstruction Fund. Monies deposited in the Sewer Reconstruction Fund shall be expended for the purpose of reconstructing the public sewer system as set forth in the Sanitary Sewer System Study on file in the office of the City Engineer, or as hereafter modified or amended by the City Council. All engineering costs, refunds as provided herein, mileage, overhead, incidental and construction costs necessarily incurred in the reconstruction of sewers shall be charged to the Fund, to the extent allowed by law. Reconstruction, as used in this Chapter, shall include the acquisition and construction of public sewers as defined in Section 5071.4 or as authorized and subject to Section 5471 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of California.
7334. REFUND. In the event any person shall have paid the applicable sewer reconstruction charge based on the additional peak flow created by new construction as provided herein, and no portion of said new construction shall have been commenced, and the permit for such construction shall have been canceled or expired, said person shall be entitled, upon written request, to a refund in an amount equal to 100% of the sewer reconstruction charge paid by said person minus 1% of said charge for administrative handling. However, the amount retained shall not exceed $10.00.
7335. CREDIT FOR PRNATE RECONSTRUCTION.  In accordance with the Sanitary Sewer System Study, aforementioned, the City Council hereby finds and determines that there are certain critical areas within the sewerage system which are overloaded, as set forth on Appendix C of that certain report entitled "Sanitary Sewer System Study" of the City Engineer. Where the City Engineer hereafter determines in any such critical area that further construction will result in sewage being disposed in the sewer lines of said area in excess of the capacity available to handle said sewage, to the point that said sewage may back up or overflow, creating a hazard to the public health, the City Engineer shall so certify in writing such a determination and finding to the City Administrator and thereafter no building permit shall be issued for any building or structure within said area until the City Engineer has certified a sufficient capacity is available in said public sewer or can be made available before the building is occupied. If any owner, in order to obtain sufficient capacity for a sewer, shall, with approval of the City Engineer, reconstruct public sewers as herein defined, said owner shall receive as a credit against the payment of any sewer reconstruction charge an amount equal to the cost of such reconstruction not subject to reimbursement as otherwise provided in this Division.

7451. PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN. All facilities of the water system shall be designed and constructed to withstand, with ample safety factors, the physical stresses to which they will be subjected and shall be free from structural and sanitary hazards. All equipment shall be of adequate size and capacity and shall be correlated with available supply from the source facilities and storage to meet the requirements of Section 7451.1 (Flow Requirements).
	TOTAL WATER FLOW REQUIREMENTS. The required total water flow for any given service area under consideration or unit water system shall be the sum of the minimum fire flow plus the maximum daily water flow requirements. The maximum daily water flow requirement shall be either 2 times or 4 times the average daily water flow requirement depending on whether the water system is to be metered or unmetered.
Qt. equals Qf plus 2Qd for metered service.
Qt equals Qf plus 4Qd for unmetered service.
Qt equals the required total water flow in gallons per minute
Qf equals the minimum fire flow water requirement in gallons per minute.
Qd equals the average daily water flow requirement in gallons per minute, which is the sum of residential or domestic water flow requirements plus the commercial, industrial, irrigation or other uses.
	AVERAGE DAILY WATER FLOW REQUIREMENTS, RESIDENTIAL OR DOMESTIC. The average
daily water flow requirement in gallons per minute in the water system described in the application for water utility authorization shall be obtained by multiplying the estimated daily water consumption in gallons per capita, times the total estimated population to be served and dividing by 1440. In no case shall the average daily design flow consumption per capital be less than 100 gallons per day at a normal operating pressure of not less than 35 p.s.i.g. Supporting data shall be submitted with the application for water utility authorization.
	COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, IRRIGATION OR OTHER USES. The average daily flow requirement in gallons per minute in the water system described in the application for water utility authorization shall be determined and supporting data thereon shall be submitted with the application.
	FIRE FLOW REQUIREMENTS. The minimum fire flow water requirement shall be determined by the Fire Chief. The computation shall be based upon a minimum of20 p.s.i.g. residual operating pressure in the street mains from which the flow is measured at the time of measurement. The Fire Chief shall be guided by but may adjust quantities set forth in the following table on the basis oflocation conditions, exposure, congestion and construction of buildings.

7706.  DECISIONS;  LIMITED  EXCEPTIONS;  APPEALS
A.	. Required Findings for Approval. The Director may approve or conditionall y approve any application for a Wireless Facility Permit when the Director finds that:
1.	the proposed wireless facility complies with all applicable construction and installation standards adopted pursuant to Section 7709, or qualifies for a limited exception pursuant to Section 7708(C) ;
2.	the applicant has demonstrated that its proposed wireless facility will be in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations for human exposure to RF emissions;
3.	the applicant has demonstrated a good-faith effort to identify and evaluate more-preferred locations and potentially less-intrusive designs; and

B.	Conditional Approvals; Denials without Prejudice . Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state
law, nothing in this Chapter is intended to limit the Director's ability to conditionally approve or deny without prejudice any application for a Wireless Facility Permit as may be necessary or appropriate to protect and promote the public health , safety and welfare, and to advance the goals or policies in this Chapter or the general plan .
C.	Limited Exceptions  for Personal  Wireless  Service Facilities .   In the  event  that  an  applicant  claims that
strict compliance with the site location guidelines in Section 7708 or the development standards in Section 7709 would effectively prohibit the applicant's ability to provide personal wireless services, the Director may grant a limited exception from such requirements to the extent necessary to prevent an effective prohibition when the Director finds:
1.	the proposed wireless facility qualifies as a "personal wireless service facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C.
§ 332(c)(7)(C)(ii) , as may be amended or superseded;
2.	the applicant has provided the Director with a reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility;
3.	the applicant has provided the Director with a written statement that contains a detailed and fact-specific explanation as to why the proposed wireless facility cannot be deployed in compliance with the applicable provisions in this Section, the Lakewood Municipal Code, the general plan and/or any specific plan;
 

4.	the applicant has provided the Director with a meaningful comparative analysis with the factual reasons why all alternative locations and/or designs identified in the administrative record (whether suggested by the applicant , the City, public comments or any other source) are not technically feasible or potentially available to reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility; and
5.	the applicant has demonstrated to the Director that the proposed location and design is the least non­ compliant configuration that will reasonably achieve the applicant's reasonable and clearly defined technical service objective to be achieved by the proposed wireless facility, which includes without limitation a meaningful comparative analysis into multiple smaller or less intrusive wireless facilities dispersed throughout the intended service area .
D.	Appeals. Any applicant may appeal the Director's written decision to deny an application for a Wireless Facility Permit. The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee must be tendered to the City within 10 days from the Director's written decision, and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds . The City Manager shall be the appellate authority for all appeals from the Director's written decision to deny a Wireless Facility Permit. The City Manager shall review the application de novo; provided , however, that the City Manager's decision shall be limited to only whether the application should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in this Section and any other applicable laws. The City Manager shall issue a written decision that contains the reasons for the decision, and such decision shall not be subject to any further administrative appeals .

Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
	GOVERNING BODY. Governing body is the City Council of the City of Lakewood.
	HARDSHIP. Hardship as related in the Variance Procedure, of this Regulation means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. Said variance shall be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship.  All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
	HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
	LEVEE. Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
	LEVEE SYSTEM. Levee system means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.
 

	LOWEST FLOOR. Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition).
A.	An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:
1.	The wet floodproofing standard in Section 8034.1.C.
2.	The anchoring standards in Section 8034.1.A.
3.	The construction materials and methods standards in Section 8034.1.B.
4.	The standards for utilities in Section 8034.2.
B.	For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition).  This prohibition  includes below-grade garages and storage areas.
	MANUFACTURED HOME. Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.  The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
	MEAN SEA LEVEL. Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
	NEW CONSTRUCTION. New Construction, for floodplain management purposes, means new freestanding structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
	OBSTRUCTION. Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
	ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD. One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood- see "Base Flood."
	PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE. Public safety and nuisance as related in the Variance Procedure, of this Regulation means that the granting of a variance shall not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin.
	RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:
A.	Built on a single chassis;
B.	400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
C.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
D.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
	REMEDY A VIOLATION. Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the Regulation or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.
	RIVERINE. Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.
	SHEET FLOW AREA. Sheet flow area - see Area of Shallow Flooding.
	SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the FIRM for Lakewood as Zones A and AR.
 

	START OF CONSTRUCTION. Start of construction includes proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
	STRUCTURE. Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
	VARIANCE. Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this Regulation which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Regulation.
	VIOLATION. Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this Regulation. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this Regulation is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 8031.42 WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
8031.43 WATERCOURSE. Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
8032. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The following general provisions are applicable to the flood plain management regulations:
	BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated July 6, 1998 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this ordinance and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this Regulation and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study and FIRM are on file in the office of the City Clerk and the Community Development Department located at Lakewood City Hall, 5050 Clark Avenue, Lakewood, California.
	COMPLIANCE. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the term of this Regulation and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall  constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
	INTERPRETATION. In the interpretation and application of this Regulation, all provisions  shall be:
A.	Considered as minimum requirements;
B.	Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
C.	Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
	WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. The degree offlood protection required by this Regulation is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Lakewood, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any food damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
 

8033. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.

	STANDARDS  OF CONSTRUCTION.    In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
A.	ANCHORING.
1.	All new construction shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2.         All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 8034.1.C. l.c.
B.	CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS.   All new construction shall be constructed:
1.	With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
2.	Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
3.	With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
4.	Within Zone AR (with base flood depth) so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from the proposed structures.
c.	ELEVATION AND FLOODPROOFING.    (See definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," and "new
construction.")
1.	New residential construction, including manufactured homes, shall meet the standards of Section 8034 and shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated as follows:
(a)	In the AR (with base flood depth) zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(b)	In the AR Zone, elevated using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is 3 feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(c)	New manufactured homes shall be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement and be elevated so that either:
(1)	The lowest floor of the manufactured home meets the elevation requirements provided in (a) or (b) above; or
(2) The manufactured home chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are not less than 36 inches in height above grade.
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by a City building inspector to be properly elevated.  Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
2.	New nonresidential construction shall either be elevated to conform with Section 8034.1.C. l or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities:
(a)	Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under Section 8034.1.C.l so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(b)	Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(c)	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this Section 8034.1.C.2 are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
 

3.	All new construction with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater.  Designs for meeting this requirement shall exceed the following minimum criteria:
(a)	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
(b)	Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
4. A flood Zone A designation has been given by FEMA to the San Gabriel River - a manmade, concrete-lined flood control channel owned and maintained by Los Angeles County. There are currently no buildings or structures, as defined by these regulations, located within Zone A. Further, no buildings or structures, as defined in these regulations, shall be constructed in Zone A. The only improvements that shall be permitted in said Zone A shall be those necessary for the continued maintenance of the flood control channel.

1.	Infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and
2.	Discharge from the systems into flood waters.
B.	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.
8035.  VARIANCE PROCEDURE.   Variance from the provisions of this Ordinance shall be as follows:
	NATURE OF VARIANCE. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the Regulation are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this Regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property  owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
The City Council hereby finds and determines that a variance should be granted only where the physical characteristics of a parcel or property are so unusual that complying with the requirements of these Regulations would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. Because of the need to protect this City and its property owners from flooding, and, therefore, granting a variance only in an unusual case, the following criteria shall be applied in determining whether a variance from the terms and provisions of this Regulation should be granted.
	VARIAN CE HEARING BOARD. The Planning and Environment Commission of the City of Lakewood shall hear all applications for a variance from the terms and provisions of this Regulation. The application shall be on a form approved by the Director of Community Development and accompanied by a Floodplain Management Regulation Variance fee established by the City Council. The Planning and Environment Commission shall consider the application at a public hearing held on notice in the same time and manner required for public hearings before the Planning and Environment Commission for variances from the terms and provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
	CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES. In passing upon requests for variances, the Planning and Environment Commission shall, in addition, consider the following:
A.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this Regulation. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, the Planning and Environment Commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the Planning and Environment Commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
B.	Variances shall only be issued upon a:
1.	Showing of good and sufficient case;
2.	Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" as defined in 8031.22; and
3. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in 8031.32, cause fraud or victimization (as defined in 8031.20) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
 

C.	The following additional relevant factors:
1.	Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2.	Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3.	Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
4.	Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5.	Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
6.	Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated  development;
7.     Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
8.	Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
9.	Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate ofrise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
10.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
D.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the Director of Community Development and shall include notification that:
1.	The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage, and
2.	Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Los Angeles County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
E.	In the granting of any variance, the Planning and Environment Commission may impose such additional conditions necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
8036.  APPEALS.  The Planning and Environment Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Regulation.
8037. APPEAL TO THE CITY COUNCIL. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning and Environment Commission pertaining to any matter referred to it under this Ordinance may appeal said decision to the City Council for a public hearing pursuant to the same fee requirements, time requirements and notice requirements provided in the Zoning Ordinance for appeals to the City Council from the decision of the Planning and Environment Commission.

CHAPTERS UNDERGROUND  UTILITY  DISTRICTS
(Added by Ord. 483)

8500. INTENT AND PURPOSES. The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to provide regulations and procedures for the removal of overhead utility facilities and the installation of underground facilities in Underground Utility Districts. The City Council finds that there exists within the City of Lakewood overhead utility facilities which, by reason of the dense growth of this metropolitan area, have become unusually and heavily concentrated. The purpose of this ordinance is to provide a procedure for the undergrounding of said facilities so as to avoid or eliminate an unusually heavy concentration of overhead utility facilities. The undergrounding of these facilities will promote the general health, safety and welfare in that streets, roads and rights of way wherein such overhead facilities are installed are extensively used by the general public and carry a heavy volume of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, in that said roads, streets or rights of way adjoin or pass through residential and business areas of the City, and an unusually heavy concentration of overhead utilities is generally obnoxious and detrimental to the general welfare.
8501. COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CHAPTER; PUBLIC NUISANCE. No person shall violate any provision of this Chapter or fail to comply with any notice or order, if any, issued pursuant to the provisions hereof. Any person violating any of said provisions or failing to comply with any said requirements shall be guilty of misdemeanor as set forth in Section 1200 of the Lakewood Municipal Code. In addition, the City Council hereby finds and determines that this Chapter is necessary to protect the public, health, safety and welfare providing a safe and reasonable procedure for the undergrounding of utility facilities and so as to avoid or eliminate unusual heavy concentration of overhead utility facilities. The City Council finds and determines that pursuant to the provisions of Section 38771 of the Government Code of the State of California, that the failure of any person to construct, provide or continually maintain underground utility facilities for that portion of the service connection on his property where required pursuant to their provisions of this Chapter in any Underground Utility District, hereafter established, is a public nuisance.
8502. DEFINITIONS. Whenever in this Chapter the words or phrases hereinafter in this Section defined are used, they shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the following definitions:
A.	"Commission" shall mean the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California.
B.	"Underground Utility District" or "District" shall mean that area in the City within which poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures are prohibited as such area is described in a resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, whether or not in public road, streets or highways.
C.	"Person" shall mean and include individuals, firms, corporations, partnerships, and their agents and employees.
D.	"Poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures" shall mean poles, towers, supports, wires, conductors, guys, stubs, platforms, crossarms, braces, transformers, insulators, cutouts, switches, communication circuits, appliances, attachments and appurtenances located above ground within a District and used or useful in supplying electric, communication or similar or associated service.
E.	"Utility" shall include all persons or entities supplying electric, communication or similar or associated service by means of electrical materials or devices, whether or not classified as a public utility.
8503. PUBLIC HEARING BY COUNCIL. The Council may from time to time call public hearings to ascertain whether the public necessity, health, safety or welfare requires the removal of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures within designated areas of the City and the underground installation of wires and facilities for supplying electric, communication, or similar or associated services. The City Clerk shall notify all affected property owners as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and utilities concerned by mail of the time and place of such hearings at least ten (10) days prior to the date thereof. Each such hearing shall be open to the public and may be continued from time to time. At each such hearing all persons interested shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The decision of the Council shall be final and conclusive.
8504. REPORT BY CITY ENGINEER. Prior to holding such public hearing, the City Engineer shall consult all affected utilities and shall prepare a report for submission at such hearing containing, among other information, the extent of such utilities' participation and estimates of the total costs to the City and affected property owners. Such report shall also contain an estimate of the time required to complete such underground installation and removal of overhead facilities.
 

8505. COUNCIL MAY DESIGNATE UNDERGROUND UTILITY DISTRICTS BY RESOLUTION. If, after any
such public hearing the Council finds that the public necessity, health, safety or welfare requires such removal and such underground installation within a designated area, the Council shall, by resolution, declare such designated area an Underground Utility District and order such removal and underground installation. Such resolution shall include a description of the area comprising such district and shall fix the time within which such removal and underground installation shall be accomplished and within such affected property owners must be ready to receive underground service. A reasonable time shall be allowed for such removal and underground installation, having due regard for the availability of labor, materials and equipment necessary for such removal and for the installation of such underground facilities as may be occasioned thereby.
8506. UNLAWFUL ACTS. Whenever the Council creates an Underground Utility District and orders the removal of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures therein as provided in Section 8505 hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person or utility to erect, construct, place, keep, maintain, continue, employ or operate poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures in the District after the date when said overhead facilities are required to be removed by such resolution, except as said overhead facilities may be required to furnish service to an owner or occupant of property prior to the performance by such owner or occupant of the underground work necessary for such owner or occupant to continue to receive utility service as provided in Section 8512 hereof, and for such reasonable time required to remove said facilities after said work has been performed, and except as otherwise provided in this Chapter.
8507. NEW CONSTRUCTION. Whenever the City Council creates an Underground Utility District and requires the undergrounding of utilities therein, no building permit shall be issued for and no person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, or move any building or structure unless utilities as herein defined are placed underground in accordance with said resolution and the provisions of this Chapter. This Section shall not prohibit the issuance of building permits for the repair, remodeling or expansion ofbuildings or structures, or uses located on any lot, where the value of said improvement is not in excess of twenty-five percent of the value of all existing structures or improvements, and exterior utility service to date of issuance of building permit is not underground. However, any transformers, not installed to that date, shall be installed within enclosed buildings or placed underground as specified in Section 8509(g).
	SAME; COMMERCIAL AND MANUFACTURING ZONES. No building permit shall be issued for, and no person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter or remove any building or structure on any parcel ofland within an commercial or manufacturing zone whether or not said parcel ofland is located within an Underground Utility District, unless utilities, as defined in this Chapter, are placed underground in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The intent of this Section is to require the undergrounding of utilities in connection with new construction in commercial and manufacturing zones so as to commence the orderly process of providing underground utilities throughout the City. The City Council finds that this Section is in keeping with the intent and purposes of this Chapter, to wit: to eliminate overhead electrical utilities throughout the City and to provide ultimately the undergrounding of utilities within the City. By requiring the undergrounding of such overhead utilities in connection with new construction, the later costly conversion of overhead utilities to underground utilities will be avoided. This Section, therefore, applies to all such new construction and pertains to the undergrounding of utilities on the Lot or Parcel upon which said new construction is located even though the exterior utilities to said parcel may be overhead or utility service on adjoining parcels may be overhead. Excepted, however, from the provisions of this Section are the following:
(a)	The repair, remodeling or expansion of buildings or structures, or uses located on any lot, where the value of said improvement, in the opinion of the City Engineer, is not in excess of twenty-five percent of the value of all existing structures or improvements thereon and exterior utility service to the date of issuance of building permit is not underground. However, any transformers not installed to that date shall be installed within enclosed buildings or placed underground as specified in Section 8509(g).
(b)	The City Engineer may grant special permission on such terms as the City Engineer may deem appropriate, in cases of unusual circumstances or practical hardship, other than the financial cost of the installation of underground utilities, without discrimination as to any person or utility to erect, construct, install, maintain, use or operate poles, overhead wires and associate overhead structures, and for such time as specified by the City Engineer or until said parcel is placed within an Underground Utility District as provided in this Chapter.
 

	SAME. Where utility service is required to be placed underground under Sections 8507 and 8507A, such utility service shall be placed underground within the exterior boundaries of said lot or parcel from the building or structure served thereby to the exterior boundary of said parcel where connection is made to the exterior supplying utility service, or unless excepted under Section 8509. Poles and overhead facilities may be located within the boundaries of such a parcel where within an easement granted to a utility for providing service to more than one lot or parcel. Utility service poles may be placed on the rear of the property to be developed only for the purpose of terminating underground facilities. Appurtenances and associated equipment, such as but not limited to, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, meter cabinets, concealed ducts in an underground system may be placed above ground. The developer or owner is responsible for complying with the requirements of this Section and he shall make the necessary arrangements with utility companies for the installation of such facilities.
8508. EXCEPTION, EMERGENCY OR UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Chapter, overhead facilities may be installed and maintained for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, without authority of the City Council in order to provide emergency service. The City Engineer may deem appropriate, in cases of unusual circumstances without discrimination as to any person or utility, to erect, construct, install, maintain, use or operate poles, overhead wires and associated overhead wires and associated overhead structures.
8509. OTHER EXCEPTIONS. This Chapter and any resolution adopted pursuant to Section 8505 hereof shall, unless otherwise provided in such resolution, not apply to the following types of facilities:
A.	Any municipal facilities or equipment installed under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
B.	Poles or electroliers used exclusively for street lighting.
C.

Having each subdivision prepared for future connection to the City's Cable Television Franchise system will provide a relatively inexpensive option to future residential dwellers. (Added by Ord. 86-7)
 

9224. SURVEY PROCEDURE AND PRACTICE. The procedure and practice for all survey work done for preparation of a final tract or parcel map shall conform to the standards and details set forth in Chapter 15, Division 3, of the Business and Professions Code, the Land Surveyor's Act. The allowable error or closure on any portion of a final tract or parcel map shall be 1/10,000.
In the event that the County Engineer, County Road Commissioners, the State Highway Engineer, or City Engineer
shall have established the centerline of any highway, street, or alley shown on a final tract or parcel map, the map shall show such centerline, together with a reference to a field book or map showing such centerline and the monuments which determine its position.  If determined by ties, the fact shall be stated upon the final tract or parcel map.
9225. MONUMENTS. Each final tract and parcel map for which a survey is required shall show durable monuments found or set at or near each boundary corner and at intermediate points, approximately one thousand (1000) feet apart, or at such lesser distances as may be made necessary by topography or culture to insure accuracy in the re-establishment of any point or line without unreasonable difficulty. The precise position and character of each monument shall be shown on the map. Such durable monument shall be not less substantial than an iron pipe of a two inch outside diameter, not less than two and one-half feet in length, with plug and tack, and set at least two feet into the ground or of such other character and stability as may be approved by the City Engineer. For the purposes of this Chapter, a lead and tack set in permanent concrete or masonry shall be considered as a durable monument. The approximate elevation of the top of each such monument with respect to the surface of the ground shall be shown on said map.
A.	Whenever necessary, in the opinion of the City Engineer, centerline monuments shall be set to mark intersections of streets or intersections of streets with the map boundary or to mark either the beginning and end of curves or the points of intersection of tangents thereof or other intermediate points.
Each such monument shall be not less durable and substantial than:
1.	In asphaltic concrete or cement pavement, a lead and tack.
2.	In unsurfaced graveled or oiled surfaces, a two inch iron pipe set not less than twelve inches below the surface, or at such depth as may be approved by the City Engineer.
3.	In bituminous macadam pavements, a spike not less than six inches long.
For each centerline monument set, the engineer or surveyor under whose supervision the survey has been made shall furnish to the City Engineer a set of notes, clearly showing the ties between the monument and a sufficient number (normally four) of durable, distinctive reference points or monuments.
Such reference points or monuments may be leads and tacks in sidewalks, or two inch by two inch stakes set back
of the curbline and below the surface of the ground, or a substitute therefore which appears to be not likely to be disturbed.
Each set of notes submitted shall conform in all respects to the standardized office records of the City Engineer. All such notes shall be indexed and filed by the City Engineer as a part of the permanent public records of this office.
B.	All monuments found or set as required herein shall be permanently and visibly marked or tagged with the registration or license number of the engineer or surveyor under whose supervision the survey was made.
C. All boundary monuments along at least one boundary line shall be set prior to filing the final map or parcel map. Interior street centerline monuments and the remainder of the boundary lines shall be set subsequent to filing of the final map (or parcel map). The final tract or parcel map shall show which monuments are in place, and which are to be set. Prior to certification of the final tract or parcel map by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall submit a written agreement in which he agrees that monuments deferred will be set within a specified time and that the notes required in Subsection B above will be furnished within a specified time.
D.    All monuments shall be subject to inspection and approval by the City Engineer.
9226. FEE FOR PARK OR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. It is found that collecting a fee in lieu ofland dedication for parks and recreational purposes would better serve the parks and recreational needs of the City for the following reasons:
A.	The City is near development capacity. Further, there are virtually no remaining vacant parcels large enough to accommodate a subdivision and provide for a park of consequential size.
B.	The City has existing parks and recreational areas. However, in view of further residential growth and the subsequent demand on those parks and recreational areas, it is deemed necessary to collect a fee in lieu of land dedication. The purpose of such fee shall be for the upgrading and maintenance of those existing parks and recreational lands and/or for the purpose of purchasing and developing additional land for park or recreational use when feasible.
 

	FEE REQUIRED. As a condition of approval of a final tract or parcel map, the subdivider shall pay a fee for the purpose of upgrading and maintaining existing parks and recreational areas and/or for the purpose of purchasing and developing additional land for park or recreational use. The upgrading and maintenance of existing park or recreational facilities and/or the purchase and development of any new such facilities shall be in accordance with the Recreation Element of the General Plan of the City adopted by the City Council on June 27, 1967, or any amended portion or part thereof, subject to and limited by the following:
A.	The provisions of this section shall apply to all subdivisions except those subdivisions excluded by Section 66477 of the Subdivision Map Act.
B.	The standards for determining the amount of fee to be paid are:
1.	Based upon the standards of the General Plan, it is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that four (4) acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within the City, be devoted to park and recreational purposes. Therefore, based upon such standards, and where the General Plan requires or provides for park and recreational facilities bearing a reasonable relationship to the proposed subdivision, fees shall be paid therefore in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
2.	The City Council finds and determines that the requirements of subsection (1) are satisfied in part by cooperative arrangements between the City and the County or School Districts, making available 2.8 acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within the City for park and recreational purposes and that the remainder of the required four acres shall be supplied by the purchase and development of vacant land for park and recreational use, when feasible, through the application of this section.
3.	Population density, for the purpose of this section, shall be determined in accordance with the 1980 Census of population on housing, which for the City of Lakewood is 2.9 persons per dwelling.
The basis for determining the total number of dwelling units shall be the number of such units permitted
by the City on the property included in the subdivision at the time the final tract or parcel map is filed for approval.
C.	The amount of fee to be paid shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated through the application of the following formula:
Square Feet Of Park Land Required























Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the time of the filing of the final map by an appraisal of the land to be subdivided. The appraisal shall be performed at the expense of the subdivider, by a City approved qualified State licensed real estate appraiser, and shall be submitted with the application for the tentative tract or tentative parcel map. Further, said appraisal shall have been done within the six (6) months preceding the public hearing of the tentative tract map or the six (6) months preceding the effective date of the Director of Community Development's decision regarding a tentative parcel map.
In the case of a tract map, the City Council shall consider all reports, studies, and appraisals considered by the
Planning Environment Commission and all and any additional or new evidence produced at the hearing before the City Council.  The decision of the City Council shall be final.
 

D.	When private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, such area shall be credited against the requirement of payment of fees provided the following standards are met:
1.	That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the Zoning and Building regulations shall not be included in the computation of each private open space; and
2.	That private ownership and maintenance of open space is adequately provided for by recorded written document; and
3.	That the use of private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City Council; and
4.	That proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location of private open land spaces;
5.	That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the Recreation Element of the General Plan and are approved by the Advisory Agency or City Council.
E.	Where fees are required for the purpose of upgrading existing parks and recreational areas and/or for the purpose of purchasing and developing additional land for park and recreational use, the same shall be paid to the City upon the final inspection or the date certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs last. The City may require said fees to be paid on a pro-rata basis for each dwelling when it receives its final inspection or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs last.  (Amended by Ord. 88-2)
F.	The fees received under this Section shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to serve the subdivision for which received and the amount of the fee shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision.
9227. DEDICATIONS.  Dedications shall be required from a subdivider in accordance with the following:
A.	DRAINAGE FACILITIES. Ifan artificial drainage facility is necessary for the general use of lot owners in the subdivision and for adequate drainage needs, subdivider shall dedicate an adequate right-of-way for such drainage channel.
B.	EASEMENT CERTIFICATE. Any final tract or parcel map of a subdivision presented to the City for acceptance of easements and recordation shall have written thereon, in addition to or as a part of any other certificate required, a certificate signed by the owner, and by all persons claiming any interest other than a right-of-way, easement, or other interest, none of which can ripen into a fee, in the land included within the subdivision shown on the map, in substantially the following form:
"We hereby certify that except as shown on a copy of this map on file in the office of the Director of Public
Works, we know of no easement or structure existing within the easements hereby offered for dedication to the public, other than publicly owned water lines, sewers or storm drainage; that we will grant no right or interest within the boundaries of said easements offered to the public, except where such right or interest is expressly made subject to the said easements."
C.	MAP SHOWING STRUCTURES REQUIRED.  Any final tract or parcel map of a subdivision presented to the City for acceptance of easements and recordation shall be accompanied by an additional copy on which is delineated all structures existing within the easements, except publicly owned storm drains, water lines, sewers, and other sanitary facilities, whether such structures are on recorded easements or not.
D.	NATURAL WATERCOURSES. In the event that a subdivision or any part thereof is transversed by any major watercourse, channel, stream, or creek, the subdivider shall dedicate an adequate right-of-way for storm drainage purposes, if, in the opinion of the Advisory Agency, such dedication is necessary. In the event that the natural watercourse does not lie entirely within such dedication, the subdivider may either construct an adequate channel within such dedication or delineate the course of said watercourse upon the final tract or parcel map.
E.	PRNATE STREET. Except as set out hereinafter, all parcels ofland intended for public use in a subdivision shown on the final tract or parcel map thereof, shall be offered for dedication for public use. Provided, however, that with the approval of the City Council or the Advisory Agency in the case of a parcel map, any street, highway, or way which is intended to be kept physically closed to public travel or posted as a private street at all times, may be shown as a private street, but in any such case, the final tract or parcel map shall contain a conditional offer of dedication which may be accepted by the City Council or the Advisory Agency in the case of a parcel map at such time as the street shall have ceased to remain so physically closed or posted and shall have been opened to public travel for a period of three months or more. Any such private street shall be shown on such map by heavy dashed lines. Sufficient data shall be shown on each private street to define its boundaries, as is required for a public street and also sufficient mathematical data to show clearly the portion of each lot within such street. The design and improvement of any such private street shall be subject to all of the requirements prescribed by this Chapter for public streets.
 

F.	RIGHTS-OF-WAY UNDER CONDEMNATION. In the event that an easement for any right-of-way required under the provisions of this Chapter in connection with any proposed subdivision is in the process of condemnation by the City at the time of the filing of any final tract or parcel map of a subdivision, the subdivider, in lieu of offering such right-of-way for dedication, may show such right-of-way upon the final tract or parcel map thereof as a private right-of-way, and prior to the approval of such final tract or parcel map shall file with the Director of Public Works a deed granting such easement to the City on condition that such condemnation proceedings are abandoned, together with a contract and bond as provided by Sections in this Chapter relative thereto.
In the event that such condemnation proceedings shall be completed, such deed, contract, and bond shall be
returned to the subdivider. In the event that such condemnation proceedings are abandoned, such deed, contract, and bond shall be delivered by the Director of Public Works to the City Council for acceptance.
G.	SEWERS AND STORM DRAINS. If, in the opinion of the Advisory Agency, either sewers or storm drains, or both, are necessary for the general use of lot owners in the subdivision, and such sewers or storm drains, or both, are not to be installed in the streets of such subdivision, the subdivider shall show upon the maps and dedicate necessary easements for such sewers or storm drains, or both.
9228. IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT AND SECURITY. The City, in approving any map, shall require the owner or subdivider to enter into a suitable agreement and to post an improvement security in the amount recommended by the City Engineer and/or the Director of Public Works, guaranteeing the installation of such improvements as shall be required of the subdivider under the provisions of this Ordinance.

1.	100% of the cost of improvement guaranteeing faithful performance, plus
2.	50% of the cost of improvements for labor and materials,  securing payment to the contractor, his subcontractor, and to persons furnishing labor, materials, or equipment.
3.	An amount estimated to be necessary for the guarantee and warranty of the work for a period of one year following completion and acceptance against defective work, labor, or materials.

2.	Service Stations.
(a)	Purpose . The City Council hereby finds that the erection , construction , or maintenance of service stations in commercial zones, unless subject to site plan review and control provided in this Subsection, can adversely affect the development of surrounding areas for residential , business , or industrial purposes or other uses . The City Council finds that the number of service stations concentrated at thoroughfare intersections , if not controlled , will have an adverse effect on the flow of traffic and will create problems of ingress and egress detrimental to surrounding properties and the general community . The City Council further finds and determines that the construction and maintenance of service stations without regulation and control will be detrimental to the public health , safety, and welfare in that the same tend to be unsightl y, noise-producing , emit and produce oil, gas, grease, and obnoxious odors and substances , tend to be places where car parts , tires, junk and material and debris accumulate , and generally impair or depreciate the benefits of occupancy and use of surrounding and adjoining properties , producing degeneration of property in such areas, with attendant conditions of deterioration affecting the public health , safety, comfort, and general welfare. In addition, the City Council further finds that abandoned service stations are more frequent than other vacant properties , in that they are built and constructed for one use only and may not be readily transformed into another use and that abandoned , unoccupied service stations create blight , become a place for the dumping and depositing of junk , trash, and debris, and generally deteriorate surrounding properties . It is the purpose of this Subsection to prevent those and other harmful effects and to promote the public convenience and welfare , conserve the value ofbuildings, and encourage the most appropriate use ofland within the City ofLakewood by requiring service station site plan review and control as hereinafter set forth . The City Council further finds and determines that restrooms at service stations are necessary to maintain the health , safety, comfort and welfare of the community, and those persons using the Cities, Highwa ys and Roadway . (Amended by Ord. 87-7)
(b)	Principles . In overcoming the aforementioned deleterious effect of service stations, the following principles should be adhered to whenever possible:

(3)	Garage and mechanical repair should only be incidental to the service station and should not become a primary use .

(5) The siting and architectural character of service station should blend with the existing or proposed character of the surrounding area .

D.	STORMWATER POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS. The Site for every Planning Priority Project shall be designed in conformance with the City of Lakewood's "Low Impact Development (LID) Best Management Practices (BMP) Design Manual" to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use.
1.	Street and road construction of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious surface shall follow the "City of Lakewood's Green Street Policy and Guidelines".
2.	The remainder of Planning Priority Projects shall prepare a LID Plan to comply with the following:
(a)	Retain stormwater runoffonsite for the Stormwater Quality Design Volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:
(1)	The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or
(2)   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour rain event, whichever is greater.
(b) Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in order NO. R4-2012- 0175.
(c)	When, as determined by the Approving Agency, 100 percent onsite retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially or fully, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID Plan. The technical infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to:
(1)	The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite;
(2)   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade;
(3)	Locations within  100 feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water;
(4)	Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern;
(5)   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;
(6) Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/ or nature of the project would create  significant difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement.
(d)	Ifpartial or complete onsite retention is technically infeasible, the project Site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in the Municipal NPDES Permit.
(1)	Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite infiltration may be available to the project Site.
(2) The project Site should contact the Approving Agency to determine eligibility. Alternative compliance options are further specified in CASQA's Post-Construction BMP Handbook.
(e)	The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per the Municipal NPDES Permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:
(1)	0.2 inches per hour, or
(2) The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.
(f)	A Multi-Phased Project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by:
(1)	Designing a system acceptable to the Approving Agency to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire Site during the first phase, and
(2) Implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of Development or Redevelopment of the Site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, "Multi-Phased Project" shall mean  any Planning Priority Project implemented over more than one phase and the Site ofa Multi-Phased Project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the Development or Redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether Developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such Development  or Redevelopment.

PART 22
ELIGIBLE  FACILITIES  REQUESTS  FOR WIRELESS  COMMUNICATION  FACILITIES
(Added by Ord. 2017-5)

9700. LEGISLATIVE INTENT
A.	. Background . Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of2012, Pub. L. 112-96, codified as 47 U.S .C. § 1455(a) ("Section 6409"), generally requires that State and local governments "may not deny, and shall approve" requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission  equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") regulations  interpret this statute and establish procedural rules for local review, which generally preempt certain subjective land-use regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential "deemed granted" remedy when the State or local government fails to approve or deny the request within 60 days after submittal (accounting for any tolling periods) . Moreover, whereas Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, codified as 47 U.S .C . § 332, applies to only  "personal wireless service facilities" (e.g., cellular telephone towers and equipment), Section 6409  applies to all "wireless" facilities licensed or authorized by the FCC (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, microwave backhaul, etc.).
B.	Findings . The City Council finds that the overlap between wireless deployments covered under Section 6409 and other wireless deployments , combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments , creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values. The City Council further finds that a separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with Section 6409 contained in a Part  devoted to Section 6409 will mitigate such potential confusion, streamline local review and preserve the city's land-use authority to the maximum extent possible .
C.	Intent. The City of Lakewood intends this Part to establish reasonable and uniform standards and procedures in a manner that protects and promotes the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with and subject to federal and California state law, for wireless facilities collocations and modifications pursuant to Section 6409, and related FCC regulations codified in 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.40001 et seq. This Section is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: (1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any personal wireless service provider's ability to provide personal wireless services; (2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity's ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service, subject to any competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory rules, regulations or other legal requirements for rights-of-way management; (3) unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such wireless facilities comply with the FCC's regulations concerning such emissions; (5) prohibit any collocation or modification that the City may not deny under federal or California state law; or (6) impose and unfair, unreasonable , discriminatory or anticompetitive fees that exceed the reasonable cost to provide the services for which the fee is charged; or
(7) otherwise authorize the City to preempt any applicable federal or California state law.
9701. DEFINITIONS. The abbreviations, phrases, terms and words used in this Part will have the meanings assigned to them in this Section 9701, or, as may be appropriate, in Lakewood Municipal Code Section 9302 (Definitions) as may be amended from time to time, unless context indicates otherwise .

In the event that any definition assigned to any phrase, term or word in this Section conflicts with any federal or state-mandated definition, the federal or state-mandated definition will control.
A.	.   "approval authority" means the commission, board or official responsible for review of permit  applications and vested with  the authority  to approve or  deny  such applications . The approval  authority  for a project located or proposed to be located on private property that requires a Section 6409 Approval  refers to the Development  Review  Board  or,  on  appeal,  the  Planning  and  Environment  Commission .  The approval authority for a project located or proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way that requires a Section 6409 Approval refers to the Director of Public Works or, on appeal, the City Manager.
 

B.	"base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § l.4000l(b)(l) , as may be amended , which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower. The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private , broadcast , and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section, supports or houses equipment described in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(1)(i)-(ii) that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process , or under another State or local regulatory review process , even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment described in 47 C.F.R. § l.4000l(b)(l)(i)-(ii) .
C.	"collocation"means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended , which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes . As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition effectively means "to add"and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site.
D.	"CPCN" means a "Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity" granted by the CPUC or its duly
appointed successor agency pursuant to California Public Utilities Code §§ 1001 et seq., as may be amended .

amended , which defines that term as any tower or base station as defined in this section, provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section .
I.		"existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R . § l.4000l(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the FCC's Section 6409 regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process , or under another State or local regulatory review process , provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built , but was lawfully constructed , is existing for purposes of this definition .
J.	"FCC " means the Federal Communications Commission or its duly appointed successor agency.
K.	"RF" means "radio frequency" or electromagnetic waves generally between 30 kHz and 300 GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum range .
L.	"Section 6409" means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of2012, Pub . L.
No . 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), as may be amended .
M.	"site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F .R. § l.4000l(b)(6) , as may be amended , which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-of-wa y, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground .
 

N.	.   "substantial  change" means  the  same  as defined  by  the  FCC  in  47  C.F.R.  §  l.4000l(b)(7),  as  may  be amended, which defines that term differently  based on the particular  wireless facility type (tower or base station) and location (in or outside the public right-of-way) . For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC's criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the wireless facility type and location .
1.	For towers outside the public rights-of-way , a substantial change occurs when:
(a)	the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater); or
(b)	the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of
the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or
(c)	the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or
(d)	the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation or deployment outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.
2.	For towers in the public rights-of-way  and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:
(a)	the proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10% or 10 feet (whichever is greater); or

(c)	the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or
(d)	the proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent (10%) larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or
(e)	the proposed collocation or modification involves excavation or deployment outside the area in
proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground .
3.	In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:
(a)	the proposed collocation or modification  would defeat the existing concealment  elements of the support structure as reasonably  determined by the approval authority; or
(b)	the proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section .
0. "tower" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § l.4000l(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees and lattice towers .
P.	"transmission equipment" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § l.4000l(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including , but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.
Q.	"wireless" means any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum .
9702. APPLICABILITY This Part applies to all requests for approval to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted pursuant to Section 6409. However, the applicant may voluntarily elect to seek approval pursuant to Part 21 for projects on private property , or approval pursuant to Lakewood Municipal Code Article VII Chapter 7 for wireless facilities in the public right-of-way .
 

9703.   PRIOR APPROVALS  REQUIRED
A.	Section 6409 Approval. Any request to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for approval under Section 6409 shall require an amendment to the underlying use permit for the tower or base station (each amendment a "Section 6409 Approval") subject to the approval authority's approval, conditional approval or denial without prejudice pursuant to the standards and procedures contained in this Part.
B.	Other Permits and Regulatory Approvals. No collocation or modification approved pursuant to this Part may occur unless the applicant also obtains all other permits and regulatory approvals as may be required by any other federal, state or local government agencies, which includes without  limitation other any permits and/or regulatory approvals issued by other departments or divisions within the City . Furthermore, any Section 6409 Approval granted under this Part shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions and/or legal requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory  approvals .
9704. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
A.	.   Application Required. The approval authority shall not approve any request for a collocation or modification submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409 except upon a duly filed application  consistent with  this Section 9704 and any other written rules the Director may establish from time to time in any publicly-stated format.
B.	Application Content. All applicants for a Section 6409 Approval shall submit all the content, information
and materials required by the Director for the application . The City Council authorizes the Director to develop, publish and from time-to-time update or amend permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials that the Director finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing any application governed under this Part. The City Council further authorizes the Director to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants , as the Director deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process . All such permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts, rules and regulations must be in written form and made available on the City's website and/or in-person at the City department responsible for approving the application to provide applicants with prior notice .
C.	Procedures  for  a  Duly  Filed  Application .    Any  application  for  a  Section  6409  Approval  will  not  be
considered duly filed unless submitted in accordance with the procedures in this Section 9704(C) .
1.	Public Right-of-Way Application Pre-Submittal Conference . Before application submittal for any proposed modification to a wireless facility located in the public rights-of-way, the applicant shall schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the Director. A pre-submittal  conference will not be required for an application to modify a wireless facility on private property . The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion  that  includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and review process, including whether the project qualifies for approval pursuant to Section 6409 or not; any latent issues in connection with the existing wireless tower or base station, including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination with other City departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues . To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to  bring any draft applications or other materials so that City  staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable . The Director, in the Director's discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under Section 9704(C)(2) and/or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any applicant who (i) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre-submittal conference and (ii) shows to the Director's satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates information  already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to the City's review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will be limited to the project discussed at the pre-submittal conference and will not be extended to any other project.
 

2.	Application Submittal.  Applications for a Section 6409 Approval must be submitted in accordance with
the following procedures:
(a)	Public Right-of-Way Applications. All applications for wireless facilities proposed to be located in the public right-of-way shall be submitted to the City at a pre-scheduled appointment with the Director. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to other applicants . Any application received without an appointment or a pre-submittal conference, whether delivered in-person, by mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the Director at a pre-submittal conference .
(b)	Private Property Applications . All applications for wireless facilities proposed to be located on
private property must be submitted in-person to the Department of Community Development during business hours .
3.	Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal process that requires an appointment, applicants shall submit a written request to the Director. The Director shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received and, if applicable, confirms that the applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement.
D.	Applications  Deemed  Withdrawn .   To promote  efficient review  and timely decisions, any application
governed under this Section will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the Director within 90 calendar days after the Director deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Director may, in the Director's discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional one year when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to grant the extension . Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant's reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension .
9705. DECISIONS
A.	.    Application  Review .    The  following  application  review  procedures  apply  based  on  the  location  of  the  proposed  project:
1.	Private Property . The Development Review Board shall review a complete and duly filed application for a Section 6409 Approval for any project proposed to be located on private property and, as the approval authority, may act on such application without prior notice or a public hearing .
2. Public Rights-of-Way. The Director shall administratively review a complete and duly filed application for a Section 6409 Approval for any project proposed to be located in the public rights-of-way and, as the approval authority, may act on such application without prior notice or a public hearing .
B.	Decision Notices .  Within five working days after the approval authority acts on an application for a Section
6409 Approval or before the FCC shot clock expires (whichever occurs first), the approval authority shall send a written notice to the applicant. In the event that the approval authority denies the application, the written notice to the applicant shall contain (1) the reasons for the decision; (2) a statement that the denial will be without prejudice; and (3) instructions for how and when to file an appeal.
C.	Required Findings for Approval. The approval authority may approve or conditionally approve any application for a Section 6409 Approval when the approval authority finds that the proposed project:
1.	involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and
