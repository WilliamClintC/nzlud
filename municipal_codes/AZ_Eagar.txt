EAGAR, ARIZONA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Town of Eagar, Arizona 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 10, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Eagar Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1987, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by "tens" (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an Ordinance Disposition Table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. Beginning with Supplement No. 10, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through 
Ordinance 2017-01, passed February 7, 2017.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, Town Manager, can be added between 2.04, Town Council, and Chapter 2.08, Town Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the Index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 10, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the town, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the Index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject Index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 10, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "Reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us to get the Supplement to you more quickly. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

Neither the existence of other remedies identified in the ordinance nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the town to recover monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the grantee, or judicial enforcement of the grantee's obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate, or any other judicial remedy at law or in equity. 
E.

(Res. 91-18 (part), 1991) 
8.10.020 - Application of wildcat dumping ordinance. 
    Unless specific provisions provide for imposition of a criminal penalty, violation of this chapter shall constitute a civil violation. Nothing in this chapter is designed to restrict or alter the application of any state or federal criminal or civil ordinances, statutes or regulations which may also apply to situations covered by this chapter. 
(Res. 91-18 (part), 1991) 
8.10.030 - Definitions. 
    In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: 
A.  "Wildcat dump or dumping" means the knowing disposal of garbage other than by methods approved in this title. 
B.  "Garbage" means household waste, furniture, construction material, abandoned vehicles, barrels, containers, raw sewage, plants, tree branches, grass cuttings, farming materials, or other material whether its source be commercial or private. 
C.  "Dispose or disposal" means to place, deposit or allow to be placed or deposited garbage on private or public property owned by a person other than the owner or possessor of the material being disposed of. 
D.  "Designated enforcement person" includes the county sanitarian, any city, state or county law enforcement officer, or any specially designated employee of a private landfill corporation which has been so empowered by the Apache County board of supervisors. 
(Res. 91-18 (part), 1991) 
8.10.040 - Disposal, general. 
A.  No person shall dispose of any garbage or other objectional waste, except at an approved municipal sanitary landfill. 
B.  Carcasses of large dead animals shall be buried or cremated, or disposed of at designated locations within a sanitary landfill, unless satisfactory arrangements have been made for disposal be it rendering or other approved methods. 
C.  Manure shall be disposed of by sanitary landfill, composting, incineration or used as fertilizer in such a manner as not to create insect breeding or a nuisance. 
(Res. 91-18 (part), 1991) 
8.10.050 - Wildcat dumping. 
A.  It shall be unlawful for any individual, partnership, business or corporation to engage in wildcat dumping as defined in this chapter. 
B.  Any designated law enforcement person may monitor and enforce this chapter against wildcat dumping in the manner prescribed herein. 
C.  When any designated law enforcement person has reasonable cause to believe from information furnished to him or from investigation made by him that any person is engaging or has engaged in wildcat dumping contrary to this chapter, he shall forthwith serve upon such person either personally, or by registered mail, a cease and desist order requiring the person upon receipt of the order, forthwith, to cease and desist from such acts. The cease and desist order shall also direct the person to completely remove and properly dispose of any improperly disposed of material within forty-eight hours of receipt of the order. 
D.  If the person upon whom a cease and desist order has been served feels that he is not liable for the alleged wildcat dumping, he may, within forty-eight hours of receiving a cease and desist order, request a hearing by way of a written petition before the county justice of the peace having venue over the matter. 
E.  Upon the failure or refusal of a person to comply with a cease and desist order within forty-eight hours, if a person to whom the order is directed does not request a hearing, the designated law enforcement person may file a civil citation in any county justice court having venue over the matter. 
F.  Upon a citation or petition for hearing being filed by either party in a justice court, the court shall set a hearing and shall notify the parties by first class mail of the date and time of such hearing. 
G.  At the hearing, the court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if the person alleged to be responsible for the wildcat dumping is indeed liable therefor. If the accused person fails to appear, a hearing shall be held in his absence. The court shall give both parties an opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses before rendering its decision. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused party is liable for the alleged dumping, it shall order that person to remove the improperly disposed of garbage at his or her own expense, and to properly dispose of it in the manner prescribed in this chapter. Failure to comply with the court's orders will be deemed to be contempt of court and the party found to be in contempt may be subject to incarceration or fines up to the maximum jurisdiction amount for justice courts. 
H.  It is not a defense to the charge of wildcat dumping that the garbage or refuse disposed of, while admittedly belonging to the suspected person, was not dumped or deposited by that person. Evidence of ownership found in the illegally dumped material creates a presumption that the owner thereof wrongfully deposited the garbage or refuse where it was found. 
I.  Any judgement of the justice court may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in A.R.S. Section 22-261 et seq.

Chapter 13.36 - WATER AND SEWER LINE EXTENSIONS 
Sections: 

13.36.010 - Costs-Agreements. 
A.  All costs of extension of water and/or sewer lines in excess of the fifty feet given with the hookup fee will be the responsibility of the developer or subdivider or individual property owner. These extensions may be installed by contractors, individuals or developers. 
B.  The material and installation must conform to town requirements and will be inspected prior to covering. Where materials are not available on a timely basis from other sources, minor assistance may be given by the town on a replacement basis within thirty days. 
C.  Lines will be placed only on town rights-of-way and will be of a size to be determined by the town which will be adequate to serve any future development beyond the current service required. In the case of water lines, no line will be less than six inches since fire hydrants cannot be attached to smaller lines and be considered as legal fire hydrants. Fire hydrants will be required where hydrant coverage is not available within six hundred feet. 
D.  When the line extensions in this section are accomplished, the town may enter into a line extension agreement with the subdivider, developer or individual (referred to in this section as "line extender"), which will enable him to recover cost for a period of five years from the date the town accepts the lines into its system for maintenance. The line extender will be required to file documentation with the town establishing the per-foot cost of the line. 
E.  Anyone having property immediately adjacent to the line and desiring to connect to it will be required to pay a proportionate share of the established cost based on the property frontage on the line. If the line can serve both sides of the street, the cost will be divided between both sides. If it can service only one side, the full cost will be borne by the side being served. If the street is paved, lines crossing the street will be placed under the pavement without breaking the paved surface. The cost of this installation will be borne by the service requester. If drilling under the pavement is prohibitive, other arrangements may be negotiated on an individual basis at the time of the service request. The required payment will be made to the town prior to service connection. The town, in turn, will pass the payment to the line extender less a twenty-five-dollar service charge. Payments will never accumulate to exceed the total cost of the line as previously established by the line extender. The payment required from the new service will be determined by the following formula: 
P = F x C / 2 
    Where: 
P =  Payment required from new service requested. 
F =  front footage of new service property adjacent to line. 
C =  Cost per foot of line as established by line extender with the town. 
2 =  This division is made when line serves both sides of the street. If only one side is served, this division will not be made. 
    Where a lateral line is requested, and serviced property is not adjacent to the line, no charge will be made under this section provided: 
1.  The serviced property is removed far enough from the line to allow a sale of adjacent property of a depth and width commensurate with other parcels along the line; 
2.  Easement is provided for requested lateral line of sufficient width and location to be suitable for a town road or street.

Title 16 - FLOODPLAIN DAMAGE PREVENTION* 
Chapters: 
Chapter 16.04 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Sections: 

16.04.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    In A.R.S. Section 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the town of Eagar to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. Section 48-3603 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town council of Eagar, Arizona, does ordain as set forth in this title. 
(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.04.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the town of Eagar are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.04.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; I. Maintain eligibility for disaster relief. 
(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.04.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

    "Hardship" as related to Chapter 16.24 of this title, meaning the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Eagar Town council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

    Sheet Flow Area. See "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood boundary and floodway map or flood insurance rate map as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
    "Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this title. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this title is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
Chapter 16.24 - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 
Sections: 

16.24.010 - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the Eagar Town council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.24.020 - Appeal board. 
A.  The floodplain board of the Eagar Town council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this title. 
B.  The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title. 
C.  In passing upon such applications, the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this title, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and 
3.  The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Apache County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 2007-4 Exh. A (part), 2007) 
16.24.030 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of Chapters 16.16 and 16.20 of this title have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
3.  Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in Chapter 16.08 of this title in the definition of "Functionally Dependent Use"; and 
4.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(Ord. 101 §3, 1982) 
17.04.040 - Procedure for obtaining approval of a subdivision. 
A.  The following steps or procedure must be followed in order to obtain approval of a subdivision. 
    Step 1. Notification of Town Planner of Proposed Development. Any person wishing to subdivide land within the town shall notify the town planner in writing of such intention. The town planner shall furnish information pertaining to the general plan of streets, parks, floodplains, drainage (if available), and zoning, and the extent of improvements which the subdivider will be required to construct along with other requirements affecting the land to be subdivided. This notification shall be made at least fourteen days prior to the submission of the tentative plat and shall include the general intent, location and nature of the proposed subdivision or development. The notification shall also include one-half of the per lot fee as established by resolution of the council. 
    Step 2. Submission to Advisory Agents, Utilities and Cable TV. The subdivider shall submit copies of the tentative plat to advisory agents, utilities and cable television companies. It is the subdivider's responsibility to meet or discuss the tentative plats with these agents, utilities and furnish the commission with reports or recommendations from these individuals. The reports or recommendations shall be provided to the town planner no later than one week prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the commission. 
    Step 3. Prepare Tentative Plat. The subdivider shall prepare a tentative plat of the subdivision and shall submit eight copies of the plat to the commission. The subdivider shall also submit a like number of drainage study/reports, and any other material or information required by the commission or Arizona state law. 
    Note: Where a subdivider owns or controls more land than he wishes to develop immediately, the commission may require that a tentative plat of the whole area be submitted, in which case, the subdivider shall indicate on the tentative plat the portion to be developed first and the portion to be held for future development. Whenever final approval has been obtained on any part of an approved tentative plat, approval of the remaining part of such tentative plat shall remain in effect for a period of one year and may be extended for another year by submission of the plat to the commission and obtaining approval from such commission. 
    Step 4. Planning and Zoning Commission "Approval" of Tentative Plat. 
a.  The commission may obtain recommendations from: (1) the town planner, town attorney, town fire chief and town engineer with respect to the tentative plat; and shall obtain recommendations from: (2) the utility companies with respect to easements for utilities; (3) the health officer with respect to water supply and sewage disposal in the event that the subdivision is not to be served by a public water supply and a public sewage disposal system. The commission shall then review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications, or may table for further study but not more than thirty days or the next regularly scheduled meeting and shall report their action to the council within forty-five days. 
b.  Approval or denial of the plat shall be based upon compliance or noncompliance with the general plan and zoning ordinance, and with the standards and conditions of approval as set forth in this chapter, and may be modified or extended by the council. Failure to act within ninety days shall be deemed approval for the tentative plat. 
c.  Action by and of the commission shall be written on the face of or on a form supplied by the commission and attached to three copies of the plat, one of which shall be retained in the files of the town clerk, one to the town planner, and one of which shall be submitted to the council. 
d.  Approval of the tentative plat by the commission constitutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. If the tentative plat is disapproved, the commission shall express its reasons therefor to the subdivider on the face of the copy of the plat, or approved form attached to the plat, which is returned to the subdivider. 
e.  The drainage report/study and requirements of groundwater active management area as defined by Arizona Revised Statutes shall be presented to the commission at the same time as the tentative plat. This report shall be provided to the town planner one week prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the commission. 
    Step 5. Final Plat Preparation and Presentation of Fee Balance. 
a.  After the tentative plat has been approved, the subdivider shall then prepare and submit one mylar or line tracing, one permanently reproducible copy, and three prints of the final plat of the subdivision to the commission. A written request for approval of the final plat shall also be submitted with the final plat, together with all necessary approvals from all other governing bodies and utility companies. 
b.  The permanently reproducible copy shall be filed in the office of the town clerk or town planner along with a checking fee charged according to rates adopted by the council by resolution. 
    Step 6. Planning and Zoning Commission Approval of Final Plat. 
a.  The commission shall obtain the recommendation of the town planner, town engineer, town attorney, police chief and town fire chief, with respect to the final plat and shall review, approve, disapprove, or approve the plat with modifications. Recommendations from the health officer shall also be obtained whenever all or part of the subdivision will not be served by a public water and sewer system. Approval of the final plat shall be based upon compliance or noncompliance with the tentative plat, and with all other standards and conditions which the town has adopted with respect to subdivisions. The council shall be informed of the action taken by the commission. 
b.  Minutes of the commission shall show the action taken. If approved, the chairman, or authorized representative, shall sign the plat and shall indicate the date of approval. 
    Step 7. Assurance of Performance Must Be Given. 
a.  The subdivider shall then post a performance bond or other approved assurance with the town clerk in an amount which is at least equal to the cost of constructing all required improvements as determined by the town engineer and/or town planner. Purpose of the bond or other assurance will be to guarantee that the improvements will be installed and paid for without cost to the town within two years from the date of approval. 
b.  The assurance shall be approved as to form and sufficiency by the town attorney before final approval and recording of the plat. 
    Step 8. Council Approval of Final Plat and Assurance. 
a.  The final plat and assurance shall then be submitted by the town planner to the council for its approval or disapproval. Final approval is conditional to staking all lots, blocks, and other areas of the subdivision and installing all survey monuments that may be required. All staking and monument installations shall be completed before recording the final plat and such shall be certified on the plat by the engineer or land surveyor. All field measurements of lot lengths and other dimensions shall have an accuracy of one-half feet per one hundred feet. 
b.  In lieu of installation of monuments as required above, such survey monuments as may be required may be installed upon completion of the street improvements, providing a suitable guarantee is posted. 
    Step 9. Recording Plat. Upon approval of the final plat and acceptance of the bond or other assurance by the council, the town clerk shall cause the approved final plat tracing bearing all required signatures and approvals to then be recorded with the county recorder. Approval of the final plat by the commission shall not be deemed as the acceptance of the dedication of any street, public way, or ground by the town. Such dedication shall occur only upon approval by the council, once dedicated streets have been brought to town standards, and the recording of the approved plat.

17.04.050 - Land divisions, combination or recombination. 
A.  In the minor divisions of land in terms of A.R.S. Section 9-463.02 and Section 17.04.020 of this chapter, land or lands that are proposed to be divided, combined or recombined (this includes approved platted subdivisions when such lots in a subdivision are being combined or recombined) for purposes of sale or lease into three or fewer lots or parcels do not result in a "subdivision" or "subdivided lands" as defined in A.R.S. Section 9-463. Each lot or parcel shall comply with minimum applicable town zoning requirements and have legal frontage. Proposed minor land divisions that have legal frontage on a town street/road right-of-way (ROW) that has not been accepted into the town's road system and maintained by the town may be considered for approval with the following conditions being met: 
1.  The undeveloped street/road ROW may be used by the property owner (applicant) as a driveway to the applicant's property if: 
a.  The applicant purchases and posts signs where identified by the public works director on the undeveloped street/road ROW stating the following: "THIS ROAD IS USED AS A PRIVATE DRIVEWAY AND IS NOT TOWN MAINTAINED. THE DRIVEWAY MAY NOT BE ACCESSIBLE DURING SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK". The minimum size of the signs shall be nine square feet (3×3); the colors black lettering on yellow background. 
b.  The applicant and/or their successor will be responsible for the maintenance and/or replacement of the signs for any reason that may cause the signs to be damaged or unreadable. 
2.  A document provided by the town and signed by the applicant agreeing to the following provision will be recorded with the Apache County Recorders Office (with the applicant paying the recording fees) and attached to the deeds of all newly created parcels informing current and future property owners of their associated responsibilities for any and all maintenance of the driveway over town right-of-way to their property(ies) to include any and all signage. This document shall also state the following: "at the time of execution of this document the town has no plans in the foreseeable future to do any road improvements to the street/road within this ROW, described as  (Identify the road/street ROW)  and will only construct/upgrade a street/road at a time when the town deems it is in the best interest of the town and it is financially feasible. Nothing in the Code or this agreement will preclude current or future property owners from participating with the town in the future to bring the street/road within the identified ROW that fronts their property to town standards. If at any time the property owner(s) on their own improve the street/road within the ROW to town standards, the town would at that time consider accepting the street/road for maintenance into the town's road system. The property owner shall indemnify and hold harmless the town from any and all claims and lawsuits including attorneys fees and costs that shall arise out of the use of the street/road ROW for its intended purpose. This document is no longer in effect once this section of the street/road within the ROW has been brought up to town standards and it is accepted into the town's road system. If the property served by this driveway is sold while this agreement is in effect the prior owner remains liable for the maintenance and the liability until a new document is recorded wherein the new owner of record agrees to the preceding stipulations for maintenance and liability. 
3.  Any lot proposed to be created through the minor division of a parcel shall not be sold until a recorded deed and survey map showing the (split) division has been approved by the community development department as complying with all applicable provisions of this section. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a process to divide, combine or recombine land into, three or fewer lots, tracts, parcels, sites or divisions with a level of review to ensure the division, combination or recombination of land complies with zoning ordinances, zoning map and does not constitute a subdivision as defined by A.R.S. Section 9-463.02. This section is not intended to prohibit or prevent the division, combination or recombination of land as authorized and permitted by the Arizona Revised Statutes and the town of Eagar zoning and subdivision ordinance. 
C.  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all divisions, combinations or recombinations of land not considered a subdivision located within the incorporated boundary of the town of Eagar. 
D.  Application. A minor land division, combination or recombination application shall be filed with the community development department on a form provided by the community development department. 
1.  Submittal and Fee. 
a.  Prior to the recordation of a deed dividing land into three or fewer parcels of land, or combining or recombining three or two parcels of land into one parcel, for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership, the owner shall submit a minor land division, combination or recombination application to the community development department. 
b.  The processing fee is set by the town of Eagar Council by resolution. If application is made after the deed is recorded, the processing fee will be doubled. 
2.  Survey Map. A registered land surveyor (R.L.S.) shall prepare the legal descriptions and map. The map shall be of a format acceptable to the county recorder (see A.R.S. Section 11-481) and shall include: 
a.  A north arrow; 
b.  The boundaries of the section (or portion thereof) within which the minor land division lies; 
c.  The boundary lines of the minor land division and the lots within it, including their bearings and distances; 
d.  Location and width of all easements within and bordering the minor land division; 
e.  Width of easements and town accepted roads bordering the property. 
E.  Review Criteria. The deed and survey map shall conform to the requirements of all the applicable town zoning code. In addition: 
1.  The design, shape, size, and orientation of the tracts should be appropriate for the use, which the division is intended, and to the character of the area in which they are located. 
2.  If a new street is created in the division of lots, parcels or lands, then by law is a subdivision and must conform to Section 17.04.040. 
F.  Administrative Review. To approve a minor land division, combination or recombination (including approved platted subdivisions when such lots are being combined or recombined) the community development department must find the following conditions exist: 
1.  Ownership of property being split, combined or recombined is demonstrated through a deed or other acceptable documents showing ownership and legal access to the parcel. 
2.  The newly created parcels or parcel when combined or recombined shall meet minimum development standards required by the town zoning code. 
G.  Action by the Town Community Development Department. Upon receipt of the submitted documents, the town community development department shall review them to determine their completeness. If the application is complete, it shall be date stamped showing the working day it arrived complete. If the submitted documents and information are found to be incomplete or insufficient, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiencies and informed the application will not be formally accepted for processing until the missing items are submitted. Upon receipt of the completed application, the town planning and zoning department shall: 
1.  Distribute the submitted application for review and comment to the appropriate departments as deemed necessary by the community development director; 
2.  Review the submitted survey map and supplemental information to determine compliance with these ordinances and prepare its report, which shall include comments received from other departments; 
3.  Based on the above findings, the community development director may then approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application within fifteen working days from the date a completed application was filed unless the applicant consents to an extension of the review period in writing; 
4.  Where the resulting parcel(s) do not meet the review criteria and the survey has been recorded, the town may have a notice of code violation recorded with Apache County Recorder's Office. Nothing herein shall be construed to create a right or expectation of such approval and no building or use permit may be issued by the town until the parcel has met the review criteria. It shall be the responsibility of the landowner to remedy all deficiencies. 
H.  Approval. If the community development director approves the application, he or she shall enter the following certification on the approved record of survey: 
I, ____________ , Community Development Director of the town of Eagar, certify that this plat creates a minor land division and or the combining or recombining of lots subject to and approved in accordance with the town of Eagar Subdivision Ordinance.

A.  Streets. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to any comprehensive or master plan adopted by the town, with due consideration to their relation to existing and other planned streets, to topographical conditions, to surface drainage, to public convenience and safety, and proposed uses of the land abutting or to be served by such street. Where not otherwise shown on a master plan, arrangement and other features of streets shall be as follows: 
1.  Provide for appropriate continuing of existing principal streets in surrounding areas where essential for circulation and access to community facilities; 
2.  Conform to a plan for a neighborhood approved or adopted by the commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to principal streets impracticable; 
3.  Minor streets shall be arranged, where practicable, so as to discourage their use by through traffic; 
4.  Avoid street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred thirty-five feet or more than ten feet; 
5.  When centerlines of connecting streets deflect from each other at any point by more than ten degrees, connect the same by a curve with a radius of not less than one hundred fifty feet; 
6.  Have all streets intersecting an arterial street at approximately a ninety-degree angle; intersections of collector and minor streets shall not vary from ninety degrees by more than fifteen degrees; 
7.  Have property lines at street intersections rounded with a radius of twenty-five feet, or of greater radius where necessary to maintain sight distance; 
8.  Avoid half streets, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with these standards, where dedication of the other half will be practicable when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is found adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted within tract. 
9.  Include no cul-de-sac streets (dead-end streets) longer than six hundred feet, and provide a turn-around area at the closed end of fifty feet radius, with returns of the same radius. 
10.  Provide tangent sections not less than one hundred feet long between reverse curves; 
11.  Provide names of streets consistent with natural alignment and extension of existing streets. New street names shall not duplicate in whole or in part, or be confused with existing names; 
12.  Avoid street grades in excess of four percent where possible. Where steeper grades are unavoidable, special treatment will be required subject to town approval; 
13.  Maximum grade shall not be more than three percent for a minimum of one hundred feet each side of intersections measured from the right-of-way line; 
14.  Longitudinal grades shall be such that the streets furnish a drainage system for the immediate vicinity and the subdivision, and the drainage system shall be so arranged that no unnatural concentration of water be discharged from the subdivision in such a way that adjoining property is damaged; 
15.  Inverted crowns, or similar street designs, that would cause traveled roadway to function as a drainage channel shall not be permitted. 
B.  Right-of-Way Widths. Provide cleared street right-of-way widths as show below. Additional width may be required if special utility installations or major drainage is used in conjunction with the right-of-way.

a.  All work under this section shall conform to "Urban Drainage Design Manual, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22," as published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
b.  Evaluating the Effects of Development. 
i.  The drainage report shall include sufficient pre- and post-development topographic information to demonstrate the effect of development. In addition to showing the developer's property, these maps shall also show enough of the property, which is adjacent to the developer's property to give a clear picture of what exists on the adjacent property that will affect drainage and will be affected by drainage on the property being developed. Information about adjacent property, such as significant differences in elevation, walls, drainage structures, buildings with their floor elevations, etc., shall be provided. The report shall address how the proposed development will affect and be protected from the one-hundred-year floodplain (if applicable). 
ii.  The amount and type of runoff flows that would exit the developer's property prior to its development and after its development must be calculated and depicted for the one-hundred-year storm event to demonstrate the effects of development. Retention or detention shall be provided to limit peak flows to pre-development peaks or off-site improvements shall be accomplished for the one-hundred-year storm, which provide capability of conveying the increased peaks to an adequate outlet. If, as the result of development, drainage flows will be reduced by facilities such as retention or detention basins, the effect of these facilities on flows exiting the property shall be described and depicted on an appropriate map or on calculation sheets. 
c.  Stormwater Detention Basins. 
i.  Stormwater detention systems must provide peak rates of outlet flow from the developed property onto downstream property, which are no greater than the peak rates of runoff flow from the same property under natural conditions with no development. Off-site drainage improvements may be required as an alternative to convey the one-hundred-year flow to an adequate outlet. 
ii.  No detention basin shall retain standing water longer than thirty-six hours if the basin has not been designed and constructed to be a permanent body of water with appropriate health, safety and water quality measures for such a body of water. 
d.  Stormwater Retention Basins. 
i.  A retention basin is needed where a detention system would not be appropriate. 
ii.  Water stored in a retention basin must be disposed of by infiltration into the soil, injection wells (also called dry wells), or pumping systems. An engineer who has selected one or more of these methods must demonstrate with the appropriate technical data that his design will insure that water will not pond in the basin longer than thirty-six hours. 
e.  Detention and Retention Basin Locations. 
i.  Parking lots shall not be used for detention or retention. 
ii.  No part of a retention or detention basin shall be constructed in a public street right-of-way or public utility easement.

i.  Detention and retention basins: peak post-development at or below pre-development for one-hundred-year storm events. 
ii.  All improvements: one-hundred-year storm. 
iii.  Culverts: minimum ten-year storm.* 
*  Capable of carrying enough of peak flow or runoff of a twenty-five-year frequency storm so that the portion of the flow over the road does not exceed six inches deep. 
iv.  Streets shall be designed based on a ten-year storm. All street flows shall be designed such that the entire subdivision drains to the streets, except where individual lots drain directly to a detention basin. Streets shall be designed such that a sufficient number of catch basins are utilized to meet the following criteria: 
(A)  Residential street with two lanes of traffic; the gutter flow shall at no time exceed six feet; 
(B)  In streets with two lanes of traffic in each direction, the gutter flows shall not exceed ten feet. 
3.  Sewage collection system, including sewer mains, manholes and house connection sewers extended to property lines. 
4.  Water distribution system, including eight-inch minimum water mains, valves, fire hydrants, service lines extended to property lines. 
5.  Electrical distribution system and telephone system located at underground, except that such lines may be located above ground when the subdivider can show the commission that underground lines are not feasible. 
6.  Permanent survey monuments shall be installed at all street intersections and property corners, in accordance with standards and specifications as adopted by the town. 
7.  Street name signs, in accordance with standards and specifications as adopted by the town, at all street intersections. 
8.  Fire hydrants shall be installed no more than one thousand two hundred feet apart, in town of Eagar right-of-way, so that no residence is more than six hundred linear feet from a fire hydrant, and in accordance with standards and specifications as adopted by the town and approved by the commission. 
9.  Mail Delivery. The subdivision shall have at least one multimail delivery box for each street or block. No single home delivery will be allowed. 
D.  Cost of Improvements. Cost of on-site improvements which are required under the provisions of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. Cost of off-site improvements which may be necessary to service the proposed subdivision may be shared between the subdivider and the town, according to the following: 
1.  The developer shall pay for all costs of construction required by the town for construction of collector and arterial streets in or on the perimeter of the subdivision. 
2.  The town shall pay the difference in cost of pipe, fittings and valves when water mains are required by the town to be larger than eight-inch minimum diameter or larger than that required to serve the subdivision. 
3.  The town shall pay the difference in cost of pipe and fittings when sewer mains are required by the town to be larger than eight-inch minimum diameter or larger than that required to serve the subdivision.

Chapter 18.56 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
Sections: 

18.56.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious locations and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
B.  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, and findings incorporated in the cases of city of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1961), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the council finds: 
1.  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral sex occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
4.  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of sexually oriented businesses. 
6.  At least fifty communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
7.  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States six hundred in 1982, two thousand two hundred in 1983, four thousand six hundred in 1984, eight thousand five hundred fifty-five in 1985 and two hundred fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-eight through December 31, 1992. 
8.  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty-three thousand six hundred thirteen cases reported in 1982 and forty-five thousand two hundred through November of 1990. 
9.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990. 
10.  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
11.  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
12.  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
13.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
14.  The findings noted in subsections B.1 through B.13 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
15.  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics, which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
16.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurance that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
17.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
18.  Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce in the incidences of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witness or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
19.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
20.  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witness to such activity. 
21.  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
22.  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct, which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
23.  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

b.  The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest residential unit, platted residentially zoned properties, and unplatted residentially zoned properties. 
c.  The separation distance from other towers described in the inventory of existing sites submitted pursuant to Section 18.72.040C. shall be shown on a plot plan or map. The applicant shall also identify the type of construction of the existing tower(s) and the owner/operator of the existing tower(s), if known. 
d.  Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if applicable). 
e.  Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the community development director an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the town of Eagar or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and type of each tower. The community development director may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the town, provided, however that the community development director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
f.  A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials and the type of security fencing. 
g.  Finished color of the tower and, if applicable, the method of camouflage and illumination. 
h.  A description of compliance with Sections 18.72.040C., D., E., F., G., J., K., L., and M., 18.72.070B.1.d., 18.72.070B.5. and all applicable federal, state or local laws.

m.  Evidence of the submittal of Form 7460 to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
2.  Factors Considered in Granting Conditional Use Permits for Towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of conditional use permit applications pursuant to Chapter 18.84 of the zoning ordinance, the planning and zoning commission shall consider the following factors in determining factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit: 
a.  Height of the proposed tower; 
b.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
d.  Surrounding topography; 
e.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
f.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
g.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
h.  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as discussed in Section 18.72.070B.3. of this chapter. 
3.  Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or Alternative Technology. An applicant shall submit information requested by the commission related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna should consist of any of the following: 
a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area meeting the applicant's engineering requirements. 
b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing tower or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e.  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs significantly exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
f.  The application demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable micro-cell network using multiple low-powered transmitters and/or receivers attached to a wire line system, is unsuitable. 
4.  Setbacks: The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers: 
a.  Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least one hundred percent of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line, but may be reduced by the commission, if a certified engineer in the state of Arizona certifies that if the tower fails it will fall within a specified radius. In the case of amateur radio tower installations, the commission, through the conditional use permit process, considering such factors as topography and height of surrounding vegetation may further reduce these minimum setback requirements. 
b.  Accessory buildings and/or structures must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
5.  Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all towers: 
a.  Separation from all residentially zoned properties shall be a minimum of two hundred feet, but may be reduced by the commission if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby. 
i.  The tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designed areas. 
b.  Separation Distances Between Towers. 
i.  Separation distances between towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower and preexisting towers. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation distances for all zoning districts shall be two thousand five hundred feet. 
ii.  The approving authority may reduce separation distances between the towers if multiple towers are to be placed on a single lot or if it is deemed in the community's best interest (i.e., the creation of a "tower farm"). 
6.  Security Fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided however, that the commission may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. All fencing shall be properly maintained. 
7.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the commission may waive such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
a.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buff of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property used for residences. The standard buff shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. All plant materials shall be properly maintained. 
b.  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived. 
c.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural tree growth around the property may be sufficient buffer.

18.84.010 - Purpose of provisions. 
A.  Each district in the town contains designated permitted uses available as a matter of right. In addition to the designated uses in each district, there are conditional uses, neither absolutely permitted as a right nor prohibited by law, which may be compatible within the district. These are privileges, in a sense, which must be applied for and approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
B.  It is the intent of this chapter to provide a set of procedures and standards for conditional uses of land or structures which, because of their unique characteristics relative to locational features, design, size, operation, circulation and public interest or service, require special consideration in relation to the welfare of adjacent properties and the community as a whole. It is the purpose of the regulations and standards set forth in this chapter to: 
1.  Allow, on one hand, practical latitude for utilization of land and structures, but at the same time maintain adequate provision for the protection of the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community and adjacent properties; and 
2.  Provide machinery for periodic review of conditional use permits to provide for further conditions to more adequately assure conformity of such uses to the public welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.84.020 - General criteria. 
    The commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application for a conditional use permit. In permitting a new conditional use or the alteration of an existing conditional use, the commission may impose, in addition to those standards and requirements expressly specified by this title additional conditions which it finds necessary to avoid a detrimental environmental impact and to otherwise protect the best interest of the surrounding area or the community as a whole. These conditions may include but are not limited to the following: 
A.  Limiting the manner in which the use is conducted including restricting the time a certain activity may take place and restraints to minimize such environmental effects as noise, vibration, air pollution, glare and odor; 
B.  Establishing special yard, open space, lot area or dimensional requirements; 
C.  Limiting the height, size or location of a building or other structure or use; 
D.  Designating the size, number and location and nature of vehicle access points; 
E.  Designating the size, location, screening, drainage, surfacing or other improvements of a parking area or loading area; 
F.  Limiting or otherwise designating the number, size, location, height and lighting of signs; 
G.  Limiting the intensity of outdoor lighting and require its shielding; 
H.  Requiring diking, screening, landscaping or another facility to protect adjacent or nearby property and designate standards for its installation and maintenance; 
I.  Designating the size, height, location of screening and materials for a fence; 
J.  Protecting and preserving existing trees, vegetation, water resources, wildlife habitat or another significant natural resource.

18.84.030 - Locational criteria. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter are designed to provide siting criteria for the conditional uses specified in this title and guidelines for the imposition of additional conditions not specifically provided for in this chapter, to the end that such uses will: 
1.  Be consistent with the intent and purpose of the district in which it is proposed to locate such use, meet the requirements of the general plan with regard to providing benefit to the general welfare of the public, and fill a probable need of the public which can best be met by a conditional use at this time and in this place; 
2.  Comply with the requirements of the district within which the conditional use is proposed and in accordance with conditions attached to such use under the authority of this title. 
B.  Conditional uses shall be located subject to the following specific standards: 
1.  Buffering, screening or other means shall be used where necessary to protect the privacy and safety of neighboring properties; 
2.  Solid waste landfills and transfer stations, natural gas storage, sewage treatment plants and electrical generating facilities shall not be in or adjacent to established residential areas; 
3.  Solid waste landfills, transfer stations, natural gas storage, sewage treatment plants and electrical generating facilities will not provide access from local residential or collector streets. Recycling centers, water reservoirs, telephone communication and switching facilities, runoff detention facilities and town or county maintenance facilities shall not provide access from local residential streets; 
4.  The site layout promotes energy conservation and user convenience as well as operation efficiency; 
5.  The site layout conforms to the established street and circulation pattern; 
6.  Noise levels and lights from the facility will not interfere with adjacent land uses.

(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.88.090 - Building design guidelines. 
A.  Building and Topography. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  Building should respect the natural topography of the site. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations: 
a.  Step a building foundation to follow the slope (fifteen percent or greater) of the site when feasible. 
i.  In general, an exposed foundation should not exceed three feet in height. 

B.  Primary Building Entrance. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  The primary entrance of a structure should orient to a street, major sidewalk, pedestrian way, plaza courtyard or other public space. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations: 
a.  Design the main entrance to be clearly identifiable. 
i.  Provide a sheltering element such as a stoop, porch, awning, gable, arcade, or portico to signify the primary entrance to a building. 
b.  Orient the primary entrance of a building to face a street, plaza or pedestrian way. 
i.  Focusing an entrance toward a parking lot without also addressing the street is not recommended. 
ii.  Consider using a "double-fronted" design where entrance to parking and to the street is encouraged. That is, provide a door to the street and another to the parking lot. 


C.  Street Level Interest. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  When a building is located close to a street or walkway, it should be designed to provide interest to pedestrians. For example, commercial buildings with storefronts are of interest to passerby, while porches, courtyards and decorative wall surfaces add interest to multifamily housing designs. These features encourage pedestrian activity and should be used whenever feasible. 
b.  The overall mass of a building should appear to be in scale with existing buildings. This will help new structures fit in with the Eagar context. At the same time, newer structures may be larger than seen before; they should simply be articulated in their form to compliment existing structures. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations: 
a.  Develop the street level of a building to provide visual interest to pedestrians. 
i.  Provide visual interest with: A display window providing views to activities in the building, or a display case with exhibits, where internal functions do not permit windows, or a decorative wall surface such as a mural or sculptural feature. 
ii.  A large expanse of blank wall is not recommended on a facade that faces a public way or a major pedestrian route. 
iii.  Avoid large panelized products or extensive featureless surfaces. 
b.  For all buildings, divide the building(s) into modules that express traditional dimensions. In general, a primary facade plane should not exceed seventy-five feet in length. If a building would exceed this dimension, provide a jog in the facade to divide it into subordinate elements that will be less than seventy-five feet in length each (the jog should be a minimum of twenty percent of the facade plane height). 
c.  All buildings shall employ at least two of the following techniques: 
i.  Change materials with each building module to reduce the perceived mass; or 
ii.  Change the height of a wall plane or building module. The change in height shall be at least twenty percent of the vertical height; or 
iii.  Change the roof form to help express the different modules of the building mass; or 
iv.  Change the arrangement of windows and other facade articulation features, such as columns or strap work that divide large wall planes into smaller components. 

D.  Roof Form. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  The primary roof form of a structure should help reduce the perceived scale of the building. For that reason, sloping roofs should be used in most contexts. These also will help the building fit with the mountain backdrop. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations: 
a.  Using sloping roof forms to reduce the perceived scale of a building is encouraged. 
b.  Any pitched roof should have a minimum of sixteen-inch overhang eaves. 
c.  Recommended roof features: 
i.  A flat roof with parapet (flat roof is not a strong recommendation); 
ii.  A cornice or molding to define the top of a parapet; 
iii.  Sloping roofs with a minimum pitch of 4:12; 
iv.  Multiple roof planes. 


E.  Building Materials. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  Materials that reduce the perceived mass of a building and appear to blend with the natural setting shall be used. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations: 
a.  The following are recommendations of building materials: 
i.  Log or log siding, natural wood siding, painted or stained wood lap or in shingle pattern where appropriate to the building use, style and setting. 
ii.  Brick, stone, rusticated block or comparable modular masonry are preferred primary building materials. Color should be integral to the material. 
iii.  New materials that convey the texture, scale, matte finish and color similar to masonry will be considered where appropriate. 
iv.  Stucco (and its artificial derivatives) when it is tinted earth tone colors and detailed to convey a sense of scale that is appropriate as a secondary building material, i.e., on second floors or above other primary building materials. Reveal and scoring lines should be used to create panels that establish shadow lines and visual relief. 
b.  Materials that are highly reflective are inappropriate as primary materials. 
i.  Mirrored glass, large expanses of metal panels, or other shiny materials are not considered primary materials. 
F.  Service Canopies. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  A gas station service area should appear as a subordinate element in the site design. 
b.  Minimize the visual impacts of a service area canopy. 
i.  Use a low profile section for the canopy itself. 
ii.  Screen lights under the canopy. 
iii.  Break up mass of the canopy area by stepping the form of the canopy area by stepping the form of the canopy or by dividing it into a set of smaller individual canopies. 
G.  Color. 
1.  Policy: 
a.  Building finish colors should help a structure blend with the natural setting and reduce its perceived scale. 
b.  Colors with high chrome values should be kept to a minimum and used only as an accent. 
2.  Guidelines and Recommendations:

Chapter 18.92 - VARIANCES 
Sections: 

18.92.010 - Purpose of provisions. 
A.  The purpose of a variance is to provide administrative relief when the strict application of the zoning requirements of lot width, lot depth, building height, setback, access or other dimension requirements excluding lot area, will cause practical difficulties in the use of property to the same extent as other properties in the same zone. These difficulties may result from geographic, topographic or other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity at the time of the enactment of the regulation and a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship upon the owner. 
B.  No variance shall be granted which shall have the effect of rezoning the property or allows the creation of a parcel which is substandard to the minimum parcel size requirements of the same zoning district or which allows the establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited or subject to conditional use procedures. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.92.020 - General criteria. 
    A variance may be authorized, subject to the application procedure set forth in this chapter and upon demonstration of adequate evidence by the applicant and review by the board of adjustment that the proposed variance satisfies the following criteria: 
A.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, building or structure involved, and are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district; 
B.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed under the terms of this title by other properties in the same district; 
C.  That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of land, building or structure; 
D.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title and the general plan and is in the public interest; 
E.  That the variance will not be materially detrimental to persons working or residing in the vicinity and will not interfere or injure the rights of other properties in the same district; 
F.  That the hardship results in more than personal inconvenience and/or financial hardship and does not result from the neglect or knowing violation of this title by the appellant subsequent to the effective date of the regulations appealed from; 
G.  Every variance granted shall be personal to the appellant and shall be transferred and shall run with the land only after completion of any authorized structure or structures; 
H.  That the variance will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district; 
I.  No nonconforming use or violations of this title with respect to neighboring lands, structures or buildings in other zoning districts, shall be considered grounds for granting a variance. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.92.030 - Application-Filing-Review. 
A.  A request for a variance, modification of an existing variance, or a review of an existing variance shall be initiated by a property owner or his authorized agent, unless initiated by the town, by filing an application on forms provided, with the community development director. Such application shall include full information on the proposed variance including lot dimensions, structure dimensions and setbacks, property access, adjacent properties, existing conditions and geographic and topographic information on the location, and shall be accompanied by a site plan prepared in accordance with the provisions of this title. 
B.  The community development director shall review each application for technical compliance with established application requirements and shall formally accept or reject the application within three working days.

(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.92.050 - Hearing procedures. 
    All applications for a variance shall be considered by the board of adjustment at a public hearing.

(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.92.070 - Conditions of approval. 
A.  Any variance is subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the zone in which such property is located. 
B.  The board of adjustment may impose such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate to ensure that the purpose and intent of this title will be fulfilled. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.92.080 - Compliance with conditions. 
    Compliance with conditions imposed in approval of a variance and adherence to an approved plot plan shall be required.

18.92.100 - Termination. 
    A variance shall be null and void one year from the date it is granted unless the use is not commenced or if a building permit is not obtained within six months and construction completed within one year of such granting, or within the time stipulated by the board of adjustment. The community development director may extend the variance for an additional period of time not to exceed one year upon the receipt of a written request from the applicant demonstrating good cause for the delay and provided that the request for extension is received by the community development director prior to the expiration of the original variance approval.

(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
Chapter 18.96 - APPEALS 
Sections: 

18.96.010 - Purpose.

(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013) 
18.96.020 - General criteria. 
A.  An appeal from any final order or decision of the community development director may be taken to the board of adjustment by any person aggrieved. An appeal is taken by filing with the community development director, the town clerk and the board of adjustment a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefore. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the community development director and board of adjustment when delivered to the town clerk, and the date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice by the town clerk. 
B.  An appeal stays all actions by the community development director seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appeal from, unless the community development director certifies to the board of adjustment that a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of adjustment or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the community development director. 
C.  The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the board of adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
D.  The board of adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to pass upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions arise in the context of an appeal from a decision of the community development director. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013)

C.  When an appeal is taken to the board of adjustment, the community development director shall have the initial burden of presenting to the board of adjustment sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appeal from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion, and the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the board of adjustment to reach a conclusion remains with the applicant seeking the appeal. 
D.  The board of adjustment's decision to reverse, affirm or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of facts that support the motion.

This motion is adopted as the board's decision if supported by more than one-fifth of the board's membership, excluding vacant seats. 
E.  All applications for an appeal shall be considered by the board of adjustment at a public hearing. Notice of the meeting shall be posted on the property and published in the official newspaper of the town no less than fifteen days prior to the hearing.

3.  Applicable adjoining political subdivisions where the property that is the subject of the application abuts the town boundary; 
4.  Such other persons as the community development director determines are likely to be affected by the proposed use;

Parties shall have the right to present their case by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination of witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The board of adjustment shall, as a matter of policy, provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence and in furtherance of this policy may limit cross-examination.

B.  Such other limitations as established by Article III of Chapter 18.12 of this title shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2013-04, Exh. A, 5-7-2013)
