     (d)    To adopt a retail transactions (sales) and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions (sales) and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

     This chapter shall be known as the “Los Banos Essential City Services Measure.” The City of Los Banos hereinafter shall be called “City.” This chapter shall be applicable in the incorporated territory of the City. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

Sec. 3-12.2.02 Operative date.
     “Operative date” means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than one hundred ten (110) days after the effective date of this chapter, December 12, 2018. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.03 Purpose.
     This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

     (a)    To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code and § 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt this tax chapter which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

     (b)    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code.

     (c)    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

     (d)    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax chapter that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal. Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.04 Contract with State.
     Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax chapter; provided, that if the City shall not have contracted with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.05 Transactions tax rate.
     For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one-half percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this chapter. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.06 Place of sale.
     For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.07 Use tax rate.

The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to State sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein. (§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

Revenue and Taxation Code; or

     (B)    Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the State under the said provision of that Code.

Sec. 3-12.2.14 Enjoining collection forbidden.
     No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the State or the City, or against any officer of the State or the City, to prevent or enjoin the collection under this chapter, or Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Cal.

(§ 1, Ord. 1166, eff. December 12, 2018)

 

Sec. 3-12.2.16 Use of proceeds.

December 12, 2018)

Chapter 13 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAXES
Sec. 3-13.01 Title.
     This chapter shall be known as the “Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law” of the City. (§ 1, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.02 Definitions.
     For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:

     (a)    “Hotel” shall mean any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes and shall include any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure, or portion thereof.

     (b)    “Occupancy” shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.

     (c)    “Operator” shall mean the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent, however, shall be considered to be compliance by both.

     (d)    “Person” shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

     (e)    “Rent” shall mean the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, property, and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

     (f)     “Tax Administrator” shall mean the City Manager.

     (g)    “Transient” shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of a concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a long period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the provisions of this chapter may be considered. (§ 2, Ord. 354, as amended by § 1, Ord. 684, eff. July 31, 1981, and § 1, Ord. 686, eff. August 5, 1981)

 

Sec. 3-13.03 Tax imposed.
     For the use and privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the transient to the City, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (§ 3, Ord. 354, as amended by § 1, Ord. 437, eff. May 21, 1971, tax operative July 1, 1971, § 1, Ord. 477, eff. August 31, 1973, § 1, Ord. 613, eff. June 21, 1978, and § 1, Urgency Ord. 790, eff. November 16, 1988, and § 1, Ord. 886, eff. June 3, 1995)

 

Sec. 3-13.04 Exemptions.
     No tax shall be imposed upon:

     (a)    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax provided for in this chapter; or

     (b)    Any officer or employee of a foreign government, which officer or employee is exempt by reason of express provisions of Federal laws or international treaties.

     No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor, made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. (§ 4, Ord. 354, as amended by § 1, Ord. 373)

 

Sec. 3-13.05 Operator’s duties.
     Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in this chapter. (§ 5, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.06 Registration.
     On or before November 16, 1964, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from him or her a “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate” which shall at all times be posted in a conspicuous place upon the hotel premises. The certificate issued by the Tax Administrator shall be personal to each operator and shall not be transferable from person to person or from place to place. Such certificate, among other things, shall set forth the following information:

     (a)    The name of the operator;

     (b)    The address of the hotel;

     (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued; and

     (d)    A statement as follows: “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting such tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department, or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit. THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE. A new proprietor of this hotel must obtain a new Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate from the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days. A new proprietor is liable for all accrued and unpaid transient occupancy taxes.”

     Such “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate” shall be valid for a period of one year, unless revoked by the Tax Administrator prior to the conclusion of the one-year period. Prior to the conclusion of one year from the date of the issuance of the certificate, each operator of such hotel shall apply to the Tax Administrator for a new certificate to cover the following year.

     The Tax Administrator shall have the power to revoke the certificate of any operator for failure to make prompt payment of any taxes or security or for the failure of any operator to abide by any provision of this Code. (§ 6, Ord. 354, as amended by § 2, Ord. 684, eff. July 31, 1981, and § 2, Ord. 686, eff. August 5, 1981)

 

Sec. 3-13.07 Reporting and remitting.
     Each operator, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, shall make a return to the Tax Administrator, on a form provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information on the return. Returns and payments shall be due immediately upon the cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator. (§ 7, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.08 Penalties and interest.
     (a)    Original delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

     (b)    Continued delinquency. Any operator who shall fail to remit any delinquent remittance on or before each period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay an additional delinquency penalty in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the tax for each additional period of thirty (30) days.

     (c)    Fraud. If the Tax Administrator shall determine the nonpayment of any remittance due pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25%) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.

     (d)    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half (1/2) of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

     (e)    Penalties and interest merged with tax. Every penalty imposed, and such interest as accrues, pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this chapter. (§ 8, Ord. 354, as amended by § 3, Ord. 684, eff. July 31, 1981, and § 3, Ord. 686, eff. August 5, 1981)

 

Sec. 3-13.09 Failure to collect and report tax: Determination of tax by Tax Administrator.
     If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the provisions of this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by the provisions of this chapter. In the event such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the service or mailing of such notice, make an application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such an application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is filed as provided in Section 3-13.10 of this chapter. (§ 9, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.10 Appeals.
     Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the service or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in this chapter for service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (§ 10, Ord. 354)

     It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (§ 11, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.12 Refunds.
     (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, such amount may be refunded as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

     (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

     (c)    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

     (d)    No refund shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (§ 12, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.13 Actions to collect.
     Any tax required to be paid by any transient pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount. (§ 13, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.14 Violations: Penalties.
     Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punishable as set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 1 of this Code.

Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by the provisions of this chapter to be made shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable as provided in this section. (§ 14, Ord. 354)

 

Sec. 3-13.15 Schedule of rates: Amendments.
     The Council from time to time, in its discretion, and by ordinance and/or resolution, may fix, alter, change, amend, or revise the rate of the tax imposed for the use and occupancy of any hotel. (§ 2, Ord. 613, eff. June 21, 1978)

 

Sec. 3-13.16 Security for collection of tax.
     (a)    To insure compliance with transient occupancy tax payment requirements, the Tax Administrator may require each person subject to such requirements to deposit with the City such security in the form of cash, bond, or other security in the amount required by the terms of this subsection. The required security shall be equal to an amount not greater than the person’s estimated average liability for a period of one year, or the sum of Fifteen Thousand and No/100ths ($15,000.00) Dollars, whichever is the lesser.

     (b)    If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid, or in the event a determination has been made that any amount due remains unpaid, the Tax Administrator, not later than three (3) years after the payment became delinquent, may give notice thereof by certified mail to all persons in the County having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent or owing any debts to the delinquent. After receiving the notice, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice until the Tax Administrator consents to a transfer or disposition or until twenty (20) days elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified, within five (5) days after the receipt of the notice, shall advise the Tax Administrator of all such creditors, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by them.

     (c)    At any time within three (3) years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable, or at any time within three (3) years after any determination becomes final, the Tax Administrator may bring an action in the courts of the State, or of any other state or of the Untied States, in the name of the City to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and interest.

     (d)    To recover transient occupancy taxes, including penalties and interest, remittable by the depositor, the Tax Administrator may apply or sell at public auction the security deposited with him or her. Security deposits in the form of bearer bonds issued by the United States of America or by the State may be sold by the Tax Administrator at private sale for the current market price. At least ten (10) days prior to the application or sale of a security deposit, the Tax Administrator shall serve upon the depositing operator notice of intent to apply or sell the security deposit. Service of the notice may be made by placing the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the depositing operator at his or her hotel. Any portion of the proceeds from the sale of the security remaining after the satisfaction of the outstanding transient occupancy taxes, penalties, interest, and costs of sale may be retained by the Tax Administrator for security or may be paid over by him or her to the depositing operator.

     (e)    If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out a business or quits a business, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the successors or assigns of such person shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that payment has been made or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the tax from the purchase price as required, such person shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the Tax Administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail a notice to the purchaser at the address as it appears on the records of the Tax Administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax Administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as provided in this subsection. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells out a business or at the time the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later.

The public purposes are to increase opportunities for useful employment or otherwise contribute to economic development. The need for the establishment of an Industrial Development Authority in the achievement of such purposes is based upon findings that industry requires the new and alternative method of capital finance which such authorities can provide in order for the Authority to undertake the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of facilities, the use of which will serve those public purposes.

Sec. 3-14.03 Declarations.
     (a)    Need. There is a need in the City for an Industrial Development Authority to provide industry with an alternative and additional method of finance in accordance with State policy as set forth in the Act.

     (b)    Organization. The Industrial Development Authority of the City established by the Act is hereby declared organized and shall function under the name “Industrial Development Authority of the City of Los Banos” and be authorized to transact business and exercise all of the powers and other authority conferred upon industrial development authorities by the Act.

     (b)    Before the City Council takes any action pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, it shall make a finding, based on substantial evidence set forth in the minutes of its meeting, that the emergency will not permit a delay resulting from a competitive solicitation for bids, and that the action is necessary to respond to the emergency.

     (c)    If the City Council orders any action specified in subsection (a) of this section, it shall review the emergency action at its next regularly scheduled meeting and at every regularly scheduled meeting thereafter until the action is terminated to determine, by a four-fifths vote, that there is a need to continue the action.

Chapter 17 RESERVED

Chapter 18 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE (RTIF)
Sec. 3-18.01 Intent.
     (a)    The City Council of the City of Los Banos finds that future development within the County of Merced to the year 2030 will result in traffic volumes in excess of capacity on the regional system of arterials, highways, and freeways as designated in the ordinance codified in this chapter.

     (b)    The City Council of the City of Los Banos finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will result in new development causing unacceptable levels of congestion on the arterials, highways, and freeways of the regional system.

     (c)    The City Council also finds and declares that, in the absence of this chapter imposing a fair-share traffic fee upon new development, existing and future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts caused by new development. (§ 1, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

 

Sec. 3-18.02 Purpose.
     (a)    The City Council of the City of Los Banos finds and determines that adoption of this regional transportation impact fee ordinance will raise additional revenues needed to construct improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by new development within the County and City of Los Banos.

     (b)    The City Council also finds and declares that the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Study (MCAG, January 18, 2008) has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by such development. (§ 2, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

 

Sec. 3-18.03 Specific findings.
     The need for regional transportation improvements and for the regional transportation impact fee established by the ordinance codified in this chapter are based on the finding of the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Study prepared by the Merced County Association of Governments whose Governing Board is composed of City Council members and County Supervisors from the County’s six (6) cities and the County Board of Supervisors. The study has established that growth to the year 2030 will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore that the area of impact for future development is appropriately the entire County of Merced. The study made the following additional findings:

     (a)    Population and employment within the County of Merced is anticipated to increase by ninety-eight (98%) percent and eighty-two (82%) percent, respectively by the year 2030 and will result in Levels of Service E and F (as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual, 6th edition) on existing arterials, highways, and freeways.

     (b)    The Regional Transportation Plan (MCAG, 2007) modeled and evaluated the effect of projected growth to the year 2030 on all major arterials, highways, and freeways in Merced County and found that without expansion, the transportation system would suffer severe congestion. Further, the plan showed that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic anticipated in the year 2030 at the desired Level of Service D.

     (c)    Existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to fund all the needed transportation improvements.

     (d)    The revenues generated by this regional transportation impact fee will provide additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements and will help provide the additional capacity needed in the year 2030 to accommodate the traffic generated by new development in the Cities and County of Merced.

     (e)    The regional transportation impact fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the cost of transportation improvements among the development that will generate the increased traffic. (§ 3, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

 

Sec. 3-18.04 Definitions.
     (a)    “Merced County” means the unincorporated areas of the County of Merced and the incorporated areas of the six (6) cities within Merced County.

Sec. 3-18.05 Applicability.
     This chapter shall apply only to new development and to any reconstruction of existing buildings that will generate additional vehicular trips. The provisions of this chapter shall take effect May 15, 2009. (§ 5, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. No. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

 

Sec. 3-18.06 Establishment of regional transportation impact fee.
     (a)    The regional transportation impact fee is not intended to be the sole source of funding for construction of the regional system. Furthermore, the total amount of fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed the cost of construction of the regional system.

     (b)    The Merced County Association of Governments has calculated the regional transportation impact fee according to the following procedure:

     (1)    MCAG determined the total costs of the regional transportation improvements.

     (2)    MCAG established a capital improvements program. This will include each regional transportation improvement project with its total project cost, and sources of funds to pay for the project, specifically showing the amount for each project to be funded through the regional transportation impact fee.

     (3)    MCAG determined the total amount to be funded by the fee by summing the fee shares of each project in the capital improvements program.

     (4)    MCAG determined the total number of peak-hour trips associated with new development, for each land use category listed in Section 3-18.04(f) of this chapter, by using the MCAG traffic model and subtracting the number of peak-hour trips generated in Merced County by each category in the year 2005 from the number of such trips generated by the same category in the year 2030.

     (5)    MCAG determined a per-trip cost by dividing the total amount to be funded by the fee by the total number of trips associated with new development.

     (6)    MCAG determined a cost per unit of development for the land use categories listed in Section 3-18.04(f) of this chapter. This cost will be calculated by multiplying the per-trip cost by the average peak-hour trips per unit of development. Units of development will be dwelling units for residential land uses, and 1,000 square feet of floor area for commercial, industrial, and other land uses.

     (7)    The fee for each new development is calculated by multiplying the cost per unit of development by the number of units being developed.

     (c)    As shown in the regional transportation impact fee study, MCAG has determined that the cost per peak-hour trip is Three Thousand One Hundred Fifteen and No/100ths ($3,115.00) Dollars.

     (d)    The regional transportation impact fee study has calculated the following transportation impact fee schedule for these land use categories:

 

Residential, single-family

$3,115 per dwelling unit

Residential, multi-family

$1,892 per dwelling unit

Retail commercial, general

$4,146 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

Retail commercial, high turnover

$12,082 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

Retail commercial, low turnover

$2,780 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

Retail commercial, over 50,000 sq. ft.

$7,161 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

Office commercial

$3,337 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

Industrial/Ag processing

$1,409 per 1,000 sq. ft. floor area

 

     (e)    Should the applicant believe the land use category in subsection (d) of this section is not appropriate for their application, the applicant may propose a more appropriate development category, subject to the approval of the City Manager or their designee, and alternative trip generation rate from the ITE Trip Generation Code noted in this chapter for use in calculation of the appropriate trip generation rate, or;

     (f)     Should the applicant believe the land use category in subsection (d) of this section is not appropriate for their application, the applicant may have prepared, at their own expense, a trip generation study conducted by a licensed traffic engineer that forecasts the anticipated peak-hour trips for the proposed development. The study procedure and results shall require the approval of the City Manager or their designee. (§ 6, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord.

Sec. 3-18.09 Credits.
     (a)    Where an applicant, otherwise subject to this chapter dedicates and/or improves those regional roads, highways, or freeways identified in Exhibit A of this chapter beyond the requirements established in subsection (b) of this section, the applicant shall receive a credit against his or her regional transportation impact fee. That credit shall be an amount equal to the land value of dedicated land and/or the actual engineering and construction costs incurred at the time of the development to the extent that the MCAG has included those costs in its estimated cost of constructing the regional system.

     (b)    The fee required by this chapter shall be supplementary to any fees and conditions imposed upon projects under the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, California Environmental Quality Act, and other State and local laws, ordinances, or administrative policy which may authorize the imposition of conditions or contributions on development and the applicant shall not be entitled to any credits for such contributions or conditions.

     (c)    The in-lieu-of-fee credit for any land dedications shall be based on the fair market value of the land dedicated as determined by an appraisal process with consultation with MCAG.

     (d)    Should the in-lieu-of-fee credit exceed the applicant’s total fee, the difference may be credited against any of the applicant’s future development which would be subject to the fee, or a reimbursement agreement may be entered into.

     (e)    Should a developer be required to provide improvements which benefit adjacent undeveloped land, the developer may be reimbursed for a proportionate share of the cost of such improvements under special agreements with MCAG and contingent upon future fees contributed from other benefited developments. In all cases, however, reimbursements under such special agreements must be timed to coincide with construction of the transportation project as scheduled in the Capital Improvement Plan adopted by MCAG. (§ 9, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. No. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

 

Sec. 3-18.10 Collection of fee.
     The RTIF shall be collected at the time when the City grants an occupancy permit for residential structures or at the time of the issuance of a building permit for nonresidential structures.

Sec. 3-18.13 Annual fee and program review.
     (a)    The City Council shall annually review, pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, and if necessary amend the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Program to ensure that it continues to be a fair and equitable method to distribute the costs of improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by future growth. This review will coincide with the adoption of the five (5) year Capital Improvement Program pursuant to Government Code Section 66006(d). In adjusting the fee program, the following shall be considered:

     (1)    Adding new transportation projects that meet program criteria;

     (2)    Deleting projects that have been completed;

     (3)    Adjust the average per trip cost to reflect changes in construction costs;

     (4)    Adjust the average per-trip cost to reflect changes in land values as indicated in an annual survey of local government costs for land subject to right-of-way acquisition;

     (5)    Revise the average per-trip cost to reflect changes in the list of regional projects as that list may be amended from time to time by the RTIF Policy Board.

     (b)    Unless otherwise as amended by the City Council, the fees listed in Section 3-18.06(d) of this chapter shall be adjusted on July 1 of each year based upon the Engineering Construction Cost Index as published by the Engineering News Record.

     (c)    Changes in the regional transportation impact fee resulting from the annual review will have no effect on fees already paid into the trust fund.

     (d)    At the time of the annual review, the City Council shall make findings for any fees remaining unexpended and uncommitted in the trust fund for five (5) or more years after deposit demonstrating a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged. Unless a need for such fees can be demonstrated, the unexpended or uncommitted portion including interest that has accrued, shall be refunded to the current record owner of the development project on a prorated basis. (§ 13, Ord. 1031, eff. June 18, 2005, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1073, eff. October 30, 2008; Ord. No. 1086, § 1, eff. 5-15-2009)

Chapter 19 STATE VIDEO SERVICE FRANCHISES
Sec. 3-19.01 General provisions.
     (a)    Purpose. This section is applicable to video service providers who have been awarded a state video franchise under the California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq. (the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 [“DIVCA”]), to provide cable or video services in any location(s) within the incorporated boundaries of the City. It is the purpose of this section to implement within the incorporated boundaries of the City the provisions of DIVCA and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated there under that are applicable to a “local franchising entity” or a “local entity” as defined in DIVCA.

     (b)    Rights reserved.

     (1)    The rights reserved to the City under this Section 3-19.01 are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this Section 3-19.01 or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other rights which may be held by the City.

     (2)    Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a state franchise shall not include, or be a substitute for:

     (i)     Compliance with applicable requirements for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the City, including, but not limited to, compliance with the conditions that the City may establish before facilities may be constructed for, or providing, non-video services;

     (ii)    Any permit or authorization required in connection with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, street work permits, pole attachment permits and street cut permits; and

     (iii)   Any permit, agreement or authorization for occupying any other property of the City or any private person to which access is not specifically granted by the state franchise.

     (3)    No permit issued by the City to a state franchise holder is itself a franchise, nor shall any permit create a vested right that would prohibit the City from revoking or amending the permit.

     (c)    Compliance with City ordinances. Nothing contained in this Section 3-19.01 shall be construed so as to exempt a state franchise holder from compliance with all ordinances, rules or regulations of the City now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with this Section 3-19.01 or California Public Utilities Code section 5800 et seq., or any obligations under any franchise issued by the City insofar as those obligations may be enforced under California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq.

     (d)    Compliance with DIVCA. When a video service provider holding a state franchise provides notice to the City pursuant to 5840(m) of DIVCA that it is commencing to provide video service to the City, all holders of local franchises shall seek a state franchise pursuant to 5930(c) and upon issuance of the state franchise by the California Public Utilities Commission for the entire franchise area served by the holder of the local franchise and the provision of notice to the City by the holder of the local franchise that it will begin providing video service under the state franchise, the local franchise shall terminate. (Ord. No. 1087, § 1, eff. 6-5-2009)

 

Sec. 3-19.02 Definitions.
     (a)    Definitions generally—Interpretation of language. For purposes of Chapter 19, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivations shall have the meaning given in this Section 3-19.02.

When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular number, words in the singular number include the plural number, and “including” and “include” are not limiting. The words “shall” and “will” are always mandatory, but the use of those terms grants no private rights to any person with respect to the City. References to governmental entities (whether persons or entities) refer to those entities or their successors in authority. If specific provisions of law referred to herein are renumbered, then the reference shall be read to refer to the renumbered provision. References to laws, ordinances or regulations shall be interpreted broadly to cover government actions, however nominated, and include laws, ordinances and regulations now in force or hereinafter enacted or amended.

PEG access capacity provided by a state franchise holder shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels (unless the PEG signal is provided to the state franchise holder at a lower quality or with less functionality), shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal, and shall be carried on the state franchise holder’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the City unless federal law requires the change.

     (2)    Where technically feasible, each state franchise holder and each incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by any means authorized under Public Utilities Code section 5870(h). Each state franchise holder and incumbent cable operator shall provide interconnection of PEG channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a state franchise holder and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage, the City may require the incumbent cable operator to allow each state franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the state franchise holder’s network as identified by the state franchise holder. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, each state franchise holder shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the City and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by each state franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. (Ord. No. 1087, § 1, eff. 6-5-2009)

Chapter 14B ALARMS AND ALARM SYSTEMS
Sec. 4-14B.010 Purpose.
     The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the allocation of public safety resources are equally applied when responding to alarm activations. It is the policy of the City of Los Banos to provide quick and efficient response to all emergency calls for aid from the police or fire services. In the case of burglary, robbery and fire alarms some businesses and residences fail to take reasonable steps to avoid false activation of the alarm system. Public resources are diverted to the source of the alarm only to find that they have responded to a false alarm. Because the response by the City results in a considerable expenditure of City employee time and is an expense to the City both in manpower and materials, the City Council has determined that the expense of such response should be reimbursed if the number of responses exceed a certain amount annually. Alarm systems that transmit a false alarm, which results in the City dispatching Police and/or Fire personnel to a location shall constitute a public nuisance. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

 

Sec. 4-14B.020 Definitions.
     The following definitions apply to the provisions of this chapter:

     (a)    “Alarm” or “alarm system” shall mean an alarm signal from a residence, business, or government agency in the City of Los Banos which ends at the City of Los Banos or at a central alarm company office which in turn relays it to the Police or Fire Department, and which causes City personnel to respond, through whatever means, results in the response of the Police and/or Fire Department personnel.

     (b)    “Emergency” shall mean an incident that reasonably requires a response by Police and/or Fire Department personnel. A response due to the failure, malfunction or other error, whether human or mechanical, which results in the transmission of an alarm to the Police Department is not an emergency. In the event that a question of whether a response by City personnel was a response to an emergency the determination of the Police Chief shall be final.

     (c)    “False alarm” shall mean an alarm to which City personnel or equipment have responded because of a report that an emergency existed and which did not require a response because the incident for which the alarm was given did not occur.

     (d)    “Alarm owner,” in determining responsibility for commercial alarms, shall mean the person or persons who contract with the alarm company for service to that alarm system or the owner, lessee, or occupant of the structure in which the alarm is installed and who maintains control of said alarm shall be ultimately responsible for that alarm system.

     For residential alarm systems in a single-family or multi-family dwellings the responsibility shall rest with the person or persons who contract with the alarm company for service to that alarm system, or the owner, lessee, or occupant of the structure in which the alarm is installed and who maintains control of said alarm. Government building alarm systems shall be the responsibility of the department head or person in charge of such facility. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

 

Sec. 4-14B.030 Permit.
     Application for Permit. Application for alarm system permits shall be filed with the Police Department on such forms as the Police Department may prescribe.

     (a)    An applicant must apply for a separate permit for each alarm site. A separate application and permit fee shall be filed and collected for each permit.

     (b)    Each alarm system permit application must contain the following information:

     (1)    Full name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, address, and telephone number of the person who will be the permit holder and of the person responsible for the proper maintenance and operation of the alarm system and payment of fees assessed under this chapter;

     (2)    Classification of the alarm site as either residential or commercial;

     (3)    For each alarm system located at the alarm site, the purpose of the alarm system; i.e., fire, burglary, robbery, or panic;

     (4)    Other information as may be reasonably required by the Police Department;

     (5)    The information furnished and secured pursuant to this chapter shall, to the extent permitted by law, be confidential and shall not be subject to public inspection. It is hereby declared that this information is critical to the safety and security of the alarm user and law enforcement personnel and that the public interest by not disclosing said information to the public clearly out weighs the public interest served by disclosing said information.

     (c)    Except for persons exempt pursuant to Government Code Section 6103, every application for an alarm system permit shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in an amount set by resolution of the City Council of the City of Los Banos. This fee shall be in addition to any other fee imposed by the City and is imposed for the purpose of defraying the costs of processing and overseeing the permit process and the cost of patrol response for false alarms.

     (d)    (1) Any alarm system permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be valid only as to the person named on the permit, and only for the particular address specified on the permit and shall not expire so long as there is no change of the named permittee or address, except as provided in subsection (e) below.

     (2)    In the event the permittee’s name is legally changed, the permittee shall so inform the Police Department within ten (10) days of such change and no fee shall be assessed to correct the permit.

     (3)    The permittee shall inform the Police Department of any other general information changes to the application within ten (10) days after such change, and no fee shall be assessed for changing the Police Department’s records.

     (e)    All permits issued will require renewal every two (2) years accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in an amount set by resolution of the City Council of the City of Los Banos. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

 

Sec. 4-14B.040 Prohibition.
     False Alarms in Excess of Three (3) per Calendar Year—Abatement of Nuisance. Maintaining, using, or possessing an alarm system, which has caused any false alarms at the same property location in excess of three (3) per twelve (12) month period shall constitute a public nuisance and be subject to imposition of a fee upon the owner or occupant of the subject property in an amount set forth within this chapter. Any fee imposed pursuant to this section may be assessed against the property upon which the nuisance occurred and a notice of lien recorded. All fire alarms must remain connected to a central alarm monitoring station. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

 

Sec. 4-14B.050 Exemptions.
     (a)    New Alarm Installations. In the case of new alarm installations there will be a thirty (30) day grace period in which response will not be monitored for enforcement of this chapter.

     (b)    City Power Outage. Alarm activations caused by a disruption of electrical service to an area of the City shall not be monitored for enforcement of this chapter. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

 

Sec. 4-14B.060 Penalties.
     (a)    After the third false alarm in a twelve (12) month period, excluding the new alarm exemption as stated in Section 4-14B.050 of this chapter, the Police Department will send a warning letter to the responsible party.

     (b)    For the fourth and fifth response to a false alarm an extra charge, as established by resolution, per response shall be collected.

     (c)    For the sixth and seventh response to a false alarm an extra charge, as established in the fee resolution, per response shall be collected.

     (d)    Additional false alarm responses will result in an extra charge, as established by resolution, per response shall be collected.

     (e)    After the seventh false alarm during a calendar year, there will be no further police response to the alarm call, pending verification from the alarm owner that repair or training has taken place to mitigate the false activations.

     (f)     Any location with a fire alarm that does not maintain a central alarm monitoring station connection is subject to a fine of One Hundred and No/100ths ($100.00) Dollars per non-connected day. (§ 1, Ord. 1072, eff. August 1, 2008)

Sec. 5-1.01 Findings and declarations.
     In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under Section 22660 of the California Vehicle Code, to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declarations:

     The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, not including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on private or public property, not including highways, except as expressly permitted by this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

     (c)    The refusal or failure of the owner or custodian of any impounded animal to pay the fees and charges after due notification shall be held to be an abandonment of the animal by the owner or custodian. Any person so abandoning their animal shall be subject to an administrative citation and fine as set by resolution of the City Council and or a misdemeanor.

     (d)    All animals that have been impounded for biting or having been deemed potentially dangerous or vicious as outlined in Article 8 of this chapter must be implanted with a microchip at the owners or custodian’s expense prior to redemption.

     (e)    Upon the third impound within a twelve (12) month period, any dog or cat so impounded must be spayed or neutered at the owner’s or custodian’s expense prior to redemption. If the owner or custodian can prove to the Animal Control Services Unit that the animal is a valuable breeding animal and currently registered with a national organization such as the American Kennel Club and such sterilization would devalue the animal, this requirement may be waived. (§ 2, Ord. 1153, eff. May 19, 2017)

 

Sec. 6-1.6004 Owner surrendered animals.
     (a)    An owner may voluntarily surrender his or her animal to the Animal Shelter for placement for adoption or other disposition. Any animal that is voluntarily surrendered to or deposited with the Animal Shelter by the owner shall immediately thereafter become the property of the City. It shall be understood that no guarantee of placement will be made, and humane disposal will be at the discretion of the Animal Control Services Unit.

     (b)    Upon surrender of the animal to the Animal Shelter, the owner or custodian must present sufficient identification such as driver’s license, California identification card, and shall sign a statement that he or she is the lawful owner of the animal.

     (c)    Any owner of an animal who voluntarily surrenders an animal to the Animal Shelter shall be subject to all applicable fees as set forth by resolution of the City Council for each animal surrendered or otherwise as provided for in this chapter.

     (d)    The surrender of an animal by an owner to the Animal Shelter, subsequent to impoundment for a violation of this chapter or any provisions of State law, shall not relieve the owner of the obligation to pay such fees or charges as set forth in this chapter incurred prior to such surrender.

     (e)    If the animal surrendered has a history of vicious or potentially dangerous behavior, it may be immediately euthanized in accordance with Section 31108.5 of the Food and Agriculture Code.

     (f)     Any animal relinquished by the purported owner that is of a species impounded by the Animal Shelter including rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, potbellied pigs, birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, or tortoises shall be held for the same holding periods, with the same requirements of care, applicable to stray dogs and cats in Sections 31108 and 31752 of the Food and Agriculture Code, and shall be available for owner redemption or adoption for the entire holding period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, kittens or puppies relinquished by the purported owner, or brought in by any other person with authority to relinquish them, to public or private shelters, may be available immediately for adoption. (§ 2, Ord. 1153, eff. May 19, 2017)

 

Sec. 6-1.6005 Disposition of impounded and surrendered animals—Spay and neuter compliance.
     (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an impounded animal which is not redeemed within the applicable holding period specified in this chapter or an animal voluntarily surrendered to the Animal Control Officer for adoption, except an animal that has been impounded for quarantine or is known to have bitten a human or to have demonstrated potentially dangerous or vicious propensities, may, at the discretion of the Animal Control Officer, be sold, adopted, or may be destroyed.

     (b)    No dog or cat shall be made available for adoption unless the dog or cat is spayed or neutered in accordance with California Food and Agricultural Code Sections 30503 and 31751.3 or is otherwise exempt pursuant to this subsection or State law. The dog or cat must be at least eight (8) weeks of age and not dependent on maternal care.

     (1)    If a veterinarian licensed to practice veterinary medicine in this state certifies that the dog or cat is too sick or injured to be spayed or neutered, or that it would otherwise be detrimental to the health of the dog or cat to be spayed or neutered, the animal shelter will hold the surgical fees paid as a spay neuter deposit. The Animal Control Services Unit shall establish the amount of the deposit at the level he or she determines is necessary to encourage the spaying or neutering of the dogs or cats. The deposit shall be temporary, and shall only be retained until the dog or cat is healthy enough to be spayed or neutered, as certified by a veterinarian licensed to practice veterinary medicine in this state. The dog or cat shall be spayed or neutered within fourteen (14) business days of that certification. The contract veterinarian will send proof of the surgical sterilization to the animal shelter with an invoice for the surgery within thirty (30) business days. The deposit will be paid directly to that adopter upon receipt of the certification or forfeited if no certification is received within the time set forth herein.

     (2)    Failure to spay or neuter the cat or dog as required, is a misdemeanor. A citation will be issued to the adopter in addition to forfeiture of the spay or neuter deposit. The animal must be returned to the animal shelter or Animal Control Officer upon demand. The adopter may also be subject to Civil Penalties as indicated in Sections 30522 and 30523 of the Food and Agriculture Code.

     (3)    The Animal Control Services Unit, society for the prevention of cruelty to animals shelters, humane society shelters, and rescue groups may enter into cooperative agreements with each other and with veterinarians in lieu of requiring spaying and neutering deposits to carry out this section.

     (c)    When an animal is sold or adopted, the receipt issued by the Animal Control Officer shall be valid title to the purchaser.

     (d)    Except as set forth herein or by State law, any stray dog or cat that is impounded pursuant to this chapter shall, prior to the euthanasia of that animal, be released to a nonprofit, as defined in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, animal rescue or adoption organization if requested by the organization prior to the scheduled euthanasia of that animal.

     (1)    Excepting stray animals experiencing irremediable suffering from a serious illness or severe injury, or needing maternal care;

     (2)    Excepting stray animals that at or subsequent to the time the animal is impounded or otherwise taken into possession, have manifested signs of a behavioral or temperamental defect that could pose a health or safety risk or otherwise make the animal unsuitable for placement as a pet; or

     (3)    Excepting stray animals that have manifested signs of disease, injury, or congenital or hereditary condition that adversely affects the health of the animal or that is likely to adversely affect the animal’s health in the future. (§ 2, Ord. 1153, eff. May 19, 2017)

     (b)    In circumstances where the bite or exposure to rabies occurred while the victim was on the property of the owner or custodian of the animal or when the victim is a member of the family or household of the owner or custodian, and when the animal is currently vaccinated against rabies and, as applicable, licensed as required by the provisions of this chapter, the animal may, at the discretion of the Animal Control Officer, be quarantined on the property of the owner provided the following:

     (1)    The owner of said animal can and does agree to ensure its confinement and isolation for the period of quarantine;

     (2)    The owner agrees, upon demand of the health officer or the Animal Control Officer during the period of quarantine, to surrender the animal to the Animal Control Officer;

     (3)    The owner agrees to immediately notify the Animal Control Officer if the animal escapes, becomes ill, or dies.

     (c)    It is unlawful for the owner or keeper of an animal to violate any of the conditions of isolation or quarantine prescribed by the health officer. Any violation of this section is a misdemeanor.

     (f)     The local health officer may determine and declare that a rabies epidemic or other unusually dangerous health situation exists among dogs or other animals in the county, or in any part thereof. Upon making of such a declaration, the local health officer shall prepare and promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary for the conduct of all persons within the area where the dangerous condition exists, and the dogs and other animals within the area. These rules and regulations of the local health officer may include, but are not limited to, quarantine, vaccination and destruction of diseased or suspected rabid or stray animals by humane methods. Such rules and regulations shall be effective when filed with the City Clerk. It shall be the duty of the Animal Control Officer to comply with all directives of the local health officer in the enforcement of the rules and regulations. A violation of any such rules and regulations shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. (§ 2, Ord. 1153, eff. May 19, 2017)

City Manager

 

     (f)     Hearing—Procedure. At the hearing, which may be continued from time to time, both oral and documentary evidence may be taken from any interested person and considered in determining whether the dog is vicious. Any owner who fails to appear after notice as provided herein was given, without obtaining a continuance from the City Manager or an appointed hearing officer, may be deemed to have waived any right to introduce evidence or object to an order made by the City Manager. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer other than the City Manager, the hearing officer shall submit a report to the City Manager summarizing the evidence and making a recommendation as to disposition.

     (g)    Hearing—Findings—Public Nuisance. If, based upon the hearing, and the report of the hearing officer, if any, the City Manager upholds the findings of the Police Chief or designee, that the dog is vicious, the City Manager shall so specify in writing together with the reasons therefore. Any dog found to be vicious is deemed a public nuisance and shall be, pursuant to the order of the City Manager, humanely destroyed, be removed from the City, or the nuisance otherwise abated by appropriate order of the City Manager. The decision of the City Manager shall be made within ten (10) business days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall be final. A copy of the decision shall be sent by first class mail postage prepaid or personally served upon the person owning or controlling the dog.

     (h)    If the City or the owner or keeper of the dog contests the determination, he or she may, within five (5) days of the receipt of the notice of determination, appeal the decision of the court or hearing entity of original jurisdiction. If the original hearing held was before a hearing entity other than a court of the jurisdiction, appeal shall be to the superior court. The appealing party shall serve personally or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, notice of the appeal upon the other party.

     (i)     Cost of Impoundment. If the City Manager finds the dog is vicious, the costs of impoundment incurred by the City, including any abatement period, shall be paid by the owner or the person controlling the dog and may become a lien against the real property upon which the dog was kept and maintained until said lien is paid. If the order includes the release of a dog found to be vicious to the owner or person controlling it, the dog shall not be released until such costs have been paid in full.

Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating procedures to provide for such protection shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be approved by the City before the construction of the facility. No user who commences a contribution to the POTW after October 31, 1986, shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until the accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the City. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it shall be the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the City of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.

     Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the City a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fine, civil penalty, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable laws.

     A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

     (h)    Charges and fees. The City may impose charges and fees which may include:

     (7)    Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this chapter.

     Such fees shall relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and shall be separate from all other fees chargeable by the City. (§ 2, Ord. 615, eff. August 21, 1978, as repealed and reenacted by §§ 11 and 12, Ord. 757, eff. October 31, 1986)

 

Sec. 6-5.05 Discharger classifications and calculations of sewage disposal charges.
     (a)    Discharger classifications. All dischargers shall be classified for sewage disposal purposes in accordance with the principal activity conducted upon the premises, as determined by the City Engineer. The purpose of classification is to facilitate the regulation of waste water dischargers based on quality, quantity, and flow, to provide an effective means of industrial waste source control, and to establish a system of sewage disposal service charges based upon the flow and waste strength which will insure an equitable recovery of City capital and operating costs.

     (b)    Calculation of user charges. All dischargers shall pay a user charge for City sewage disposal services. The charges will reflect the quantity, quality, and flow of the waste water of the dischargers and will be based on City capital and operating costs to collect, treat, and dispose of waste water.

     Additionally, all industrial dischargers shall pay their share of the total amount of the grant fund awarded, divided by a thirty (30) year period. The determination of each industrial user’s share of the grant funded facilities shall be determined by the utilization of unit rate formulas which are in compliance with subsection (1) of subsection (b) of Section 204 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Acts Amendments of 1972, in particular, Sections 35.928, 35.928-1, 35.928-2, and 35.935-13. (Copies of said sections of said Act are on file with the City Clerk.) Such unit charge formulas are essentially as set forth in the revenue program attached as Appendix B to the City of Los Banos Amended Projected Report for Sewage Disposal System Enlargement, dated February, 1974, corrected to agree with the Federal Water Pollution Control Acts Amendments of 1972 and the final amount of the grant as estimated during the interim period of construction and as determined to be the final grant amount at the end of the construction period.

     Flat charges and unit charges shall be established by the City from time to time and set forth in a schedule of rates and charges. Unit charges will be established for each element of waste water strength which incurs City costs of collection, treatment, and disposal. Commencing on August 21, 1978, such elements will be biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids. Unit charges for additional elements, including chemical oxygen demand, may be established from time to time as the City incurs additional costs for collection, treatment, and disposal. A unit charge for volume also will be established which reflects City costs of collection, treatment, and disposal of the total volume of waste water.

     The total sewage disposal charge for each discharger shall be calculated as follows:

     (1)    Dischargers from residential premises with four or less dwelling units. A uniform flat monthly charge per dwelling unit for sewage disposal service will be made to dischargers of waste water in this class, regardless of the source of water, except for mobile home subdivisions.

     (2)    Dischargers from residential premises with five or more dwelling units and dischargers from nonresidential premises. All dischargers of waste water in this class will be assigned a business classification code depending on the principal activity conducted on the premises, except for mobile home subdivisions which will be classed as residential. All dischargers conducting the same principal activity and discharging similar flows and loadings will receive the same business classification code. The City Engineer shall determine the typical waste water strength for each business classification code, and each discharger within that classification will be assumed, for sewage disposal charge purposes, to have the same typical waste water strength.

     A classification charge shall be established by the City for each business classification code which will be based on the unit charges for the elements of waste water strength, including volume, as applied to the typical waste water strength of the particular classification.

     The sewage disposal charge to a discharger in this class will be calculated by multiplying the classification charge by the volume of water used by the discharger. Any discharger in this class who is issued a waste water discharge permit will thereafter pay a sewage disposal charge as a permit discharger.

     (3)    Permit dischargers. Dischargers of waste water who arc required to obtain a permit under the provisions of this chapter, excluding permits issued solely for flow estimation, shall pay a sewage disposal charge which shall be the sum of the products of the following: the unit charge for each element of waste water strength, multiplied by the estimated or measured amount per volume of water of each element, multiplied by the volume of water used; and the unit charge for volume, multiplied by the volume of water used as determined herein. The sewage disposal charge for permit dischargers, including both waste water strength and water use, shall be calculated by an apportionment by the City Engineer of strength and use to each building sewer at the discharger’s premises.

     Dischargers requiring permits solely for flow estimation shall pay a sewage disposal charge calculated by multiplying the classification charge by the volume of water determined by the estimation.

     In addition to a sewage disposal charge, the permit discharger shall pay all applicable City permit charges. Commencing on August 21, 1978, all dischargers required to obtain a permit shall pay a sewage disposal charge in accordance with their business classification code until a permit is issued. Dischargers receiving flow estimations on August 21, 1978, shall apply and be issued a permit before the expiration of the existing flow estimate.

     (c)    Determinations of water used. The applicable volume of water upon which sewage disposal charges shall be based will be determined as follows:

     (1)    Water discharged to sewers. For premises where no portion of the water received from any source is consumed in the principal activity of the discharger or removed from the premises by means other than sewers, the sewage disposal charge shall be applied against the total amount of water used from all sources. The amount of City water received will be determined from City records. The amount of water used from other sources will be determined by means of a meter installed at the expense of the discharger and approved by the City or by an estimate prepared by the City, after obtaining a permit in accordance with this chapter. The discharger shall report to the City the sources of all water used at his premises other than that supplied by the City and shall notify the City of any changes in such sources.

     (2)    Water not discharged to City sewers. For premises where a portion of the water received from any source does not flow into sewers because of the principal activity of the discharger or removal by other means, the charge for sewage disposal service will be applied against the volume of water discharging from such premises into sewers. Written notification and proof of the diversion of water shall be provided by the discharger if he is to avoid the application of the sewage disposal charge against the total amount of water used from all sources. He may be required to install a meter, of a type and at a location approved by the City, at his own expense, to determine the quantity of water flowing into the sewers. However, where it is impractical to install meters and where the quantity of water diverted from the sewers amounts to more than twenty (20%) percent of the total water used, the charge for sewage disposal services may be based upon an estimate prepared by the City, after obtaining a permit in accordance with this chapter. (§ 2, Ord. 615, eff. August 21, 1978)

 

Sec. 6-5.06 Waste water discharge permits.
     (a)    Permits required. All dischargers, other than residential, whose waste water requires special regulation or contains industrial wastes requiring source control, and all dischargers requiring an estimation of water use, shall secure a waste water discharge permit.

     (1)    Mandatory permits. All dischargers in the following categories shall obtain a waste water discharge permit:

     (i)     Dischargers who are designated as critical industries and whose water use for any two (2) consecutive months during the preceding twelve (12) month period has equaled or exceeded a cumulative two (2) month volume of 1,500 cubic feet. A critical industry is a discharger whose waste water requires special regulation or contains industrial wastes requiring source control or whose average waste water strength cannot be established on a business classification basis.

     (a)    Authority. The City is charged with the responsibility for the City’s waste water control program and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

     (b)    Waste water source control requirements. In order to effectively administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, the City may require any discharger to comply with any or all of the following requirements:

     (1)    Discharge reports. The City may require discharge reports, including, but not limited to, questionnaires, technical reports, sampling reports, test analyses, and periodic reports of waste water discharges.

     When a report filed by a person pursuant to this section is not adequate in the judgment of the City, the City may require such person to supply such additional information as the City deems necessary.

     The discharge report may include, but not be limited to, the nature of the process, volume, and rates of waste water flow, elements, constituents, and characteristics of the waste water, together with any information required in an application for a waste water discharge permit.

     (2)    Monitoring programs. The City may require of dischargers such technical or monitoring programs, including the submission of periodic reports, as is deemed necessary; provided, however, the burden, including the costs, of such programs and reports shall bear a reasonable relationship to the need for the report and the benefits to be obtained therefrom. The discharger shall pay the applicable City charge for the monitoring program, in addition to the sewage disposal and other charges established by the City.

     The monitoring program may require the discharger to conduct a sampling and analysis program of a frequency and type specified by the City to demonstrate compliance with the prescribed waste water discharge limits. The discharger may either:

     (i)     Conduct his own sampling and analysis program provided he demonstrates to the City that he has the necessary qualifications and facilities to perform the work; or

     (ii)    Engage a private consulting firm or laboratory certified by the Department of Public Health of the State.

     (3)    Inspection facilities. The City may require any nonresidential discharger to construct, at his own expense, a sampling facility or inspection manhole, together with the necessary related measuring and sampling equipment, in accordance with the Standard Specifications of the City. The sampling facility or inspection manhole shall be constructed on the building sewer of the discharger or other location approved by the City; provided, however, the City may permit the installation of such facilities on the premises of the discharger at a location which will permit City access to the facility at all times.

     Such construction shall be completed within sixty (60) days following written notification from the City, unless such time is extended by the City for good cause. The City may require the discharger to install such sampling facilities or inspection manholes on each building sewer.

     (4)    Pretreatment facilities. Pretreatment systems or devices may be required by the City to treat waste water prior to its discharge to the public sewer when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge to the public sewer of waste water having strength in violation of the prohibitions or exceeding the limits established by this chapter or to distribute waste water discharges over a period of time.

     Pretreatment systems or devices shall be required to treat waste water prior to its discharge to the public sewers in order to comply with Federal pretreatment standards, pursuant to Section 307(B) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Pretreatment standards for incompatible pollutants discharged into the public sewer shall be consistent with the “Effluent Limitation Guidelines” published pursuant to Sections 301(B) and 304(B) of said Act.

     All pretreatment systems or devices shall be approved by the City, but such approval shall not relieve a discharger of the responsibility for taking all steps necessary to comply with the waste water limitations established by the City. All required pretreatment equipment shall he installed and operated at the discharger’s expense.

     (c)    Trade secrets. When requested by the person furnishing a report or permit application or questionnaire, the portions of the report, or other document, which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available to governmental agencies for use in making studies; provided, however, such portions of a report, or other document, shall be available for use by the City or the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.

     (d)    City inspections. The City may inspect the facilities of any discharger to ascertain whether the provisions of this chapter are being met and the waste water discharge limits are being complied with. Such inspections shall be made with the consent of the owner or possessor of such facilities or, if such consent is refused, with a warrant duly issued pursuant to the procedure in accordance with general law; provided, however, in the event of any emergency affecting the public health or safety, such inspections may be made without consent or the issuance of a warrant.

     To verify the waste water flows and strengths reported by dischargers or to determine compliance with this chapter, inspections, measurements, and samplings may be conducted from time to time by the City. The City shall have the right to install, maintain, and operate the necessary sampling and measuring equipment on the premises of the discharger.

     (e)    New connections. Dischargers will be assigned a business classification code and informed of the applicable prohibitions, limits, or conditions and the applicable rates and charges governing sewage disposal service at the time of an application for water service from the City.

     All nonresidential dischargers seeking a new sewer connection to a public sewer and any new discharger requiring information prior to applying for water service shall contact the City. The City will inform the discharger of the regulations governing sewage disposal service and the applicability of requirements for inspections, samplings, and pretreatment facilities.

Sec. 6-9.02 Responsibility.
     The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for implementing and enforcing the cross-connection control program. An appropriate backflow prevention assembly shall be installed by and at the expense of the water user at each user connection where required to prevent backflow from the water user’s premises to the domestic water system. It shall be the water user’s responsibility to comply with the City of Los Banos requirements. (§ 1, Ord. 878, eff. August 5, 1994)

 

Sec. 6-9.03 Administration.
     The Program Administrator for the cross-connection control program shall be the Director of Public Works or his designee. The Program Administrator will establish and maintain a list of approved backflow prevention assemblies as well as a list of approved backflow prevention assembly testers. The Program Administrator shall conduct necessary surveys of water user premises to evaluate the degree of potential health hazards. The Program Administrator shall notify users when an assembly needs to be tested. The notice shall contain the date when the test must be completed. (§ 1, Ord. 878, eff. August 5, 1994)

 

Sec. 6-9.04 Cross-connection protection requirements.
     The type of protection that shall be provided to prevent backflow into the public water supply system shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard, actual or potential, that exists on the water user’s premises. Unprotected cross-connections with the public water supply are prohibited. The type of backflow prevention assembly that may be required (listed in decreasing level of protection) includes: Air-gap separation (AG), Reduced Pressure Principal Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP), and a Double Check Valve Assembly (DC). The water user may choose a higher level of protection than required by the water supplier. The minimum types of backflow protection required to protect the approved water supply at the user’s water connection to premises with varying degrees of hazard are listed in Table 1 of Section 7604, Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Situations which are not covered in said Table 1 shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the appropriate backflow protection shall be determined by the water supplier or health agency.

A list of approved backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed in a manner prescribed in Section 7603, Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Location of the assemblies shall be as close as practical to the user’s connection. The City of Los Banos shall have the final authority in determining the required location of a backflow prevention assembly.

     Testing of backflow assemblies shall be conducted only by qualified testers and testing will be the responsibility of the water user. Backflow prevention assemblies must be tested at least annually and immediately after installation, relocation or repair. More frequent testing may be required if deemed necessary by the City. No assembly shall be placed back in service unless it is functioning as required. These assemblies shall be serviced, overhauled, or replaced whenever they are found to be defective and all costs of testing, repair, and maintenance shall be borne by the water user. Approval must be obtained from the City prior to removing, relocating or replacing a backflow prevention assembly. (§ 1, Ord. 878, eff. August 5, 1994)

 

Sec. 6-9.06 Water service termination.
     (a)    When the Program Administrator encounters water uses that represent a clear and immediate hazard to the potable water supply that cannot be immediately abated, he shall direct the City to institute the procedure for terminating water service. Conditions or water uses that create a basis for water service termination shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

When a cash bond has been posted, the cash shall be returned to the depositor or to his or her successors or assigns upon the termination of the bond, except any portion thereof which may have been used or deducted as set forth in this chapter.

Upon the receipt of such moneys, the City Inspector shall proceed by such mode as he deems convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred therefor other than the expenditure of the sums on hand therefor.

     (d)    Corrections of default: Cash bonds. If a cash bond has been posted, the notice of default shall be given to the principal and, if compliance is not completed within the time specified, the City Inspector shall proceed without delay and without further notice or proceedings whatever to use the cash deposit, or any portion of such deposit, to cause the required work to be done by contract or otherwise in the discretion of the City Inspector. The balance, if any, of such cash deposit shall, upon the completion of the work, be returned to the depositor, or to his or her successors or assigns, after deducting the cost of the work, plus ten (10%) percent thereof.

     (e)    Options to demolish. When any default in the performance of any term or condition of the relocation permit has occurred on the part of the principal, the surety shall have the option, in lieu of completing the work required, to demolish the building or structure and to clear, clean, and restore the site. If the surety defaults, the City Inspector shall have the same option.

     (f)     Right of entry.

No person shall interfere with or obstruct the ingress or egress to or from any such premises by any authorized representative or agent of any surety or of the City engaged in the work of completing, demolishing, or removing a building or structure for which a relocation permit has been issued after a default has occurred in the performance of the terms or conditions thereof.

     (a)    An improved design based on density control and better community environment may be used. The standards set forth in Article 4 of this chapter and Sections 9-2.501 through 9-2.508 and 9-2.511 through 9-2.513 of this article may be varied where such design has the approval of the Commission, and where, in the opinion of the Commission or on appeal to the Council, such deviation will:

The owners of the individual lots, as a condition of ownership of such lots, shall be required to participate in the legal entity so formed and be responsible to such legally formed entity for the cost of performing the necessary maintenance. Any failure to so maintain shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be, unlawful and a public nuisance endangering the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.

     (c)    As an incentive to creating better overall communities, the Commission may authorize deviations from standards set forth in this chapter where such deviations are for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

     (d)    Before any deviation based on improved design shall be authorized, such deviation shall be passed by the Commission upon a finding that the deviation, as authorized, shall result in a community which is a substantial improvement over the community which could have been developed by using the requirements set forth in Article 4 of this chapter and in this article.

     (a)    That pursuant to this chapter, provision has been made for the payment of fees, dedication of land, or both, or some other provision has been agreed upon by the applicant for a residential development in the school district to mitigate the conditions of overcrowding within such attendance area; or

     (b)    That there are specific overriding fiscal, economic, social, or environmental factors which, in the judgment of the decision-making body, would benefit the City, thereby justifying the approval of a residential development otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter without requiring the payment of fees, or the dedication of land, or other alternate provisions required by this chapter. (§ 1, Ord. 746, eff. June 20, 1986)

 

Sec. 9-2.1410 Payment of fees: Dedication of land.
     In an attendance area where the Council has concurred as provided in Section 9-2.1408 of this article that overcrowding exists, the applicant of a proposed residential development, as a condition of approval, or the obtaining of a building permit, shall pay fees, make an equivalent arrangement in lieu thereof, dedicate land, or do a combination thereof, as set forth in Section 9-2.1413 of this article, unless excepted as provided in subsection (c) of said section, as determined by the decision-making body during the hearings and other proceedings on specific residential development applications falling within their respective jurisdictions. Prior to the imposition of the fees, or the dedication of land, or both, it shall be necessary for the decision-making body acting on the application to make the following determination: that the facilities to be constructed, purchased, leased, or rented from such fees or the land to be dedicated, or both, are consistent with the General Plan of the City.

Sec. 9-2.1412 Standards for fees or land.
     Any requirement imposed pursuant to this article shall bear a reasonable relationship and will be limited to the needs of the community for interim elementary or secondary facilities and shall be reasonably related and limited to the need for schools caused by the development; provided, however, the fees shall not exceed the amount necessary to pay five (5) annual lease payments for the interim facilities. In lieu of the fees, the builder of a residential development, at his or her option and at his or her expense, may provide interim facilities owned or controlled by such builder at the place designated by the school district, and, at the conclusion of the fifth school year, the builder, at the builder’s expense, shall remove the interim facilities from such place or deed them to the district at the district’s option. (§ 1, Ord. 746, eff. June 20, 1986)

 

Sec. 9-2.1413 Amount of fees or land.
     (a)    When fees are required by this article to be paid in lieu of land dedication, such fees shall be as follows:

     (1)    Facilities fees. Every person carrying out a residential development in an area where school overcrowding has been determined to exist shall pay a facilities fee. The amount of the facilities fee shall be set by resolution of the Council after consultation with the affected school districts, and shall bear a reasonable relationship, and will be limited to, the needs of the community for interim elementary, junior high, and high school facilities, and shall be reasonably related and limited to the need for schools caused by the residential development. However, fees shall not exceed the amount necessary to pay five (5) annual lease payments for interim facilities prorated per student. The fee shall be paid at the time of the issuance of a building permit.

     (2)    Dedication or provision of facilities in lieu of fees. Upon agreement by the developer, the City, and the affected school district, a developer may dedicate land in lieu of paying the fees required by this article. The fair market value of the land so dedicated shall be equivalent to the amount of fees otherwise required. The developer, at his or her option and expense, may provide interim facilities meeting the standards and at a location established by the affected school district. The developer shall remove such facilities at the conclusion of the fifth (5th) school year at his or her expense, unless the developer and the school district agree that such facilities may remain.

     When fees are required in combination with land dedication, such fees may be reduced in proportion to the amount of land dedicated. The school district shall be responsible to collect such fees, and the City shall be notified by the district of such collection having been made by the district prior to issuing a building permit.

     (b)    If the payment of a fee is required, such payment shall be made to the school district prior to issuing a building permit.

     (c)    The standards for the amount of dedicated land required shall be recommended by the governing board of the school district where a determination has been made pursuant to Section 9-2.1407 of this article that conditions of overcrowding exist. Such standards and the facts supporting them shall be transmitted to the Council. If the Council concurs with such standards, they shall, until revised, be used by the decision-making bodies in situations where dedications of land are required as a condition to the approval of a residential development. Nothing set forth in this article shall prevent the Council from establishing and using standards other than those established by the school district in the event the Council does not concur in those transmitted by the district.

     (d)    Land shall be deeded or dedicated directly to the school district under procedures set forth by the City Attorney. (§ 1, Ord. 746, eff. June 20, 1986)

 

Sec. 9-2.1414 Refunds.
     (a)    If a final subdivision map, a parcel map, or a conditional use permit is vacated or voided, and the City or school district still retains the land, and if the applicant so requests, such land shall be returned to the applicant.

     (b)    If a residential development approval is vacated or voided, and the school district still retains the fees collected therefor, and if the applicant so requests, such fees with interest shall be returned to the applicant, less administrative fees. (§ 1, Ord. 746, eff. June 20, 1986)

 

Sec. 9-2.1415 School district schedules.
     Following a decision by the City to require the dedication of land or the payment of fees, or both, the governing body of the school district shall submit a schedule specifying how the district will use the land or fees, or both, to solve the conditions of overcrowding. The schedule shall include the school sites to be used, the classroom facilities to be made available, and when such facilities will be available. In the event the governing body of the school district cannot meet the schedule, the governing body shall submit modifications to the Council stating the reasons for the modifications. (§ 1, Ord. 746, eff. June 20, 1986)

 

Sec. 9-2.1416 Fees: Separate accounting: Reports.

Note
*    Article 14, as added by Ordinance No. 769, effective November 20, 1987, renumbered to Article 16 by codifier because Articles 14 and 15 are in use.

 

Sec. 9-2.1601 Authority, general purpose, and definitions.
     This chapter is adopted pursuant to California Government Code Section 66477 and the general police power of the City, for the purpose of executing and implementing the Parks, Open Space and Resources Element of the General Plan of the City of Los Banos. It is the purpose of this article for: (1) the acquisition of park land for neighborhood and community parks through dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof; and (2) the development of park and recreation facilities by imposition of fees in connection with the development of new dwelling units.

     Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this article.

     (a)    The term “developer” includes every person, firm, or corporation constructing a new dwelling unit, directly or through the services of any employee, agent, independent contractor, or otherwise.

     (b)    The term “new dwelling unit” includes each structure of permanent character, places in a permanent location, which is planned, designed or used for residential occupancy, including, but not limited to, one-family, two (2) family, and multifamily dwellings, apartment houses and complexes and mobile home spaces, but not including hotels, motels, and boardinghouses for transient guests.

     (c)    The term “subdivision” includes any type of construction, land division or improvement of land which provides for dwelling units identified under the provisions of Section 66424 of the California Government Code. “Subdivision” shall also include any increase in the number of mobile home spaces.

     (i)     High density. (§ 1, Ord. 844, eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 51, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1602 Requirements.
     At the time of approval of the tentative map, parcel map, or final map, or upon issuance of a building permit, the Director of Public Works shall determine pursuant to Section 9-2.1604 hereof the land required for dedication or in-lieu fee payment. As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, or upon issuance of a building permit, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the City, for neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this article. (§ 1, Ord. 844, eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1603 Park acreage standard.
     It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that five (5) acres of property for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within this City be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. Said five (5) acres are justified by the existing ratio of five (5) acres of neighborhood and community parks per one thousand (1,000) residents in the City, and the current maximum utilization of said acreage by the residents of Los Banos. (§ 1, Ord. 844, eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 52, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1604 Formula for the dedication of land.
     Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the Parks, Open Space and Resources Element of the General Plan of the City, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula and the average number of persons per unit shall be obtained from the California Department of Finance.

     The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows:

 

Average No. of Persons/Unit

×

park acreage standard 1,000 population

=

minimum acreage dedication/DU

 

     Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 9-2.1612 hereof.

     For the purpose of this section, the number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the tentative or parcel map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in an area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone, including any applicable density increases. In the case of a condominium project, the number of dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term “new dwelling unit” does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is filed.

     The developer shall, without credit: (1) provide full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to, curbs, gutter, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to this section; (2) provide for fencing along the property line of that portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land; (3) provide improved drainage through the site; and (4) provide other minimal improvements which the City determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational purposes.

     The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made pursuant to this section shall be reviewed at the tentative map stage in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section 9-2.1610 and approved by the Director of Public Works. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 53, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1605 Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication.
     (a)    General formula. If there is no park or recreation facility designated in the Recreation and Parks Element of the General Plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of that land, prescribed in Sections 9-2.1604 and 9-2.1606 hereof and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 9-1606 hereof.

     However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes where the developer proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is approved by the Director of Public Works.

     (b)    Use of money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1606 Amount of fees in lieu of land dedication.
     When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value determined by the City Council per Section 9-2.1607. The fee shall be determined by the following formula:

 

DUs

x

Pop DU

x

5 acres
1,000 people

x

FMV
buildable acre

=

in-lieu fee
in-lieu fee

 

where:

 

DUs

= number of dwelling units as defined in Section 9-2.1604

Pop
DU

= population per dwelling unit as defined in Section 9-2.1604

FMV

= fair market value determined by Section 9-2.1607

Buildable acre

= a typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope less than ten (10%) percent, and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions

 

     Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Director of Public Works to ascertain if they comply with the formula set forth above. If compliance is found, then the fees shall be approved by the Director of Public Works. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 54, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1607 Determinations of fair market value.
     The fair market value per buildable acre shall be determined annually by resolution adopted by the City Council. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1608 Park development impact fees.
     A fee shall be paid for park development by the developer of each new dwelling unit irrespective of whether the developer is required to dedicate land or pay fees in lieu of land dedication as set forth in Sections 9-2.1604 and 9-2.1605. This fee shall be used to pay for those improvements including, but not limited to, landscaping and installation or recreational facilities which are required by Sections 9-2.1604 and 9-2.1605. The fee shall be established at the rate set forth by City Council resolution. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 10, Ord. 954, eff. March 3, 2000, and § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1609 Determinations of park development cost per acre.
     The development cost per acre of park land shall be determined annually by resolution adopted by the City Council. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1610 Determinations of land or fees.
     Whether the City accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:

     (a)    The natural features, access, and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication;

     (b)    The size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication;

     (c)    The feasibility of dedication;

     (d)    The compatibility of dedication with the Parks, Open Space and Resources Element of the General Plan; and

     (e)    The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 55, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1611 Credit for private open space.
     No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space usable for active recreational purposes is provided in a proposed planned development or real estate development as defined in Sections 11003 and 11003.1 of the Business and Professions Code, partial credit, not to exceed forty-five (45%) percent, shall be given against the requirement of and dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the City finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met:

     (a)    Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and

     (b)    Private park and recreational facilities shall be owned by an owners’ association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a one hundred (100%) percent affirmative vote of the membership and approved by the City, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for a proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities; and

     (c)    Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City or its successor; and

     (d)    The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location; and

     (e)    The open space for which credit is given is a minimum of three (3) acres and provides a minimum of five (5) of the local park basic elements listed as follows, or a combination of such, and other recreation improvements that will meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area:

Sec. 9-2.1612 Procedure.
     At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, rezoning, or any other discretionary approval of development, the Director of Public Works shall determine, pursuant to Section 9-2.1604 hereof, the land required for dedication. If the Director of Public Works requires in-lieu fee payment by the developer, the Director of Public Works shall set the amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based at the time of final map approval. At the time of filing of final map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land. In-lieu fees and park development fees shall be paid at the time of building permit. In-lieu fees shall be established using current land values at the time of payment with the formula set forth in Section 9-2.1606. Park development fees shall be established using current park improvement costs at the time of payment with the formula set forth in Section 9-2.1608.

     Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final subdivision map or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final subdivision map.

     The land to be dedicated and/or in-lieu and park development fees to be paid, shall be subject to the latest adopted ordinances, resolutions, policies, and fees adopted by the City Council and in effect at the time of the final map review and approval. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, revised, corrected in Reprint No. 36, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

     Fees determined pursuant to Sections 9-2.1606 and 9-2.1608 shall be paid to the City Finance Director and shall be deposited into the subdivision park trust fund, or its successor. Money in said fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of park land or improvements related thereto.

     Collected fees shall be appropriated by the local agency to which the land or fees are conveyed or paid for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five (5) years upon receipt of payments or within five (5) years after the issuance of building permits on one-half (1/2) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later.

     If such fees are not so committed, these fees shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision.

     The City Finance Director shall report to the City at least annually on income, expenditures, and status of the subdivision park trust fund. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1614 Exemptions.
     Subdivisions containing less than five (5) parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this article; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as condition to the issuance of such permit.

     The provisions of this article do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing apartment building which is more than five (5) years old when no new dwelling units are added. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1615 Developer-provided park and recreation improvements.
     After the Planning Commission or Director of Public Works determines that land is required for dedication and/or in-lieu fee payment by the developers, the developer may apply to the Public Works Department for permission to construct specified park and recreation improvements on the land of said developer required for dedication or on other land within the same City service area to be developed as a park. If the Public Works Department grants the developer permission for construction of specified parks and recreation improvements on said land, said Department shall fix the dollar value of the parks and recreation improvements prior to construction. The agreed dollar value of park and recreation improvements provided by the developer may be credited against the fees required by this article, provided the improvements are constructed per the approved plans by the Department. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007, and § 56, Ord. 1102, eff. February 4, 2012)

 

Sec. 9-2.1616 Schedule for the use of land or fees.

Sec. 9-2.1617 Access.
     All land offered for dedication for local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the City if the City determines that public street access is unnecessary for maintenance of the park area or use thereof by residents. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

 

Sec. 9-2.1618 Sale of dedicated land.
     If during the ensuing time between dedication of land for park purposes and commencements of first-stage development, circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as receipt of a gift of additional park land or a change in school location), the land may be sold upon the approval of the City with the resultant funds being used for the purchase of a more suitable site. (§ 1, Ord. 844 C.S., eff. May 31, 1991, as amended by § 1, Ord. 1062, eff. December 19, 2007)

The value shall be fixed by resolution of the City Council based upon a cost analysis of developing municipal off-street parking facilities as determined by the City Engineer. The money shall be deposited in a special fund for the exclusive purpose of providing future public parking facilities in the general vicinity of the buildings to be served which will benefit from the use, or used for expanding and improving existing uses, or a change of use within an existing structure, or maintaining off-street parking facilities in the district insofar as practical.

     (a)    In-lieu fees collected shall be committed by the City Treasurer by allocation to a project, within a period of ten (10) years after payment of such fees or after issuance of building permits, whichever occurs later.

Part 2. Site Plan Review
Sec. 9-3.2315 Site plan review: Purpose.
     The provisions of this part are intended to establish a process by which certain types of development projects and structures are subject to a comprehensive discretionary review approval process before the City’s Planning Commission; to ensure that projects conform to City development standards; to ensure that the site plan, building layout, size, shape, scale, mass, height, architectural design, architectural components, materials, colors, landscaping, on- and off-site parking and traffic circulation, and other aspects of the physical plan for the development project are compatible with neighboring developments, are adequate and appropriate for the site, and achieve the highest level of design that is feasible for the project; and to ensure that city services are adequate and available to the project. The City intends to use this process to improve the aesthetic character of the community, to preserve and enhance property values, protect adjacent properties from adverse impacts caused by development projects, to assist private and public developers to be more cognizant of public concerns for the aesthetics of projects, and to bring about a community that is livable, safe, functional and attractive. (§ 5, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2316 Applicability: Projects subject to site plan review.
     (a)    Nonresidential. All new nonresidential buildings or structures requiring a building permit, the expansion of any nonresidential buildings or structures requiring a building permit, or the modification of the exterior design or façade of an existing nonresidential building or structure or element requiring a building permit shall be subject to site plan review in accordance with this Part 2.

     (b)    Residential.

     (a)    The Planning Commission may conduct study sessions on the aesthetic aspects related to a proposed project, at the request of the applicant or upon referral from the Community Development Director or designee. The purpose of the study session is to provide the applicant with feedback from the Planning Commission early on in the design process, before becoming overly invested in a given design. This review shall be in the nature of a discussion between the Planning Commission and the applicant concerning the aesthetic aspects of a project proposal, and shall not constitute a final decision by the Planning Commission concerning the proposed development.

     (b)    The Planning Commission shall review and consider the architectural, landscaping, and the lighting elements of project proposals in light of the City’s general plan, any applicable specific plan, the adopted design review policies set forth in the City Community Design Standards, any applicable development standards set forth in this Code, and shall provide the applicant with feedback on the proposed design.

(§ 5, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2319 Project submittals.
     (a)    Application. Any person requiring design review approval shall submit an application on a form prepared by the Community Development Department.

Sec. 9-3.2320 Planning Commission criteria for approval.
     (a)    Findings. The Planning Commission shall approve a site plan if it makes all of the findings specified in these sections. In making the findings set forth herein the Planning Commission shall consider and evaluate those aspects of the project described in Sections 9-3.2317(b) and 9-3.2318(c). In approving a site plan, the Planning Commission may impose any reasonable conditions it deems appropriate. The Planning Commission shall make the following findings before approving a site plan:

     (1)    That the proposed development is consistent with the general plan, any specific plans, and any design standards adopted by the City Council;

     (2)    That the design and location of the proposed development and its relationship to existing or proposed developments and traffic in the vicinity thereof is such that it will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the neighborhood; and that it will not unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of existing or proposed developments in the vicinity thereof, and that it will not create traffic hazards or congestion;

     (3)    That the design of the proposed development is in keeping with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and is not detrimental to the harmonious, orderly, and attractive development contemplated by this ordinance and the general plan of the City;

     (4)    That the design of the proposed development would provide a desirable environment for its occupants, as well as for its neighbors, and that it is aesthetically of good composition, materials, textures, and colors;

     (5)    That the proposed use complies with all applicable requirements of the zoning district in which it is located and all other applicable requirements; and

     (6)    That the overall development of the subject property is designed to ensure the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare.

     (b)    Conditions. In approving a site plan review application, reasonable conditions may be imposed that are deemed necessary to implement the intent and purpose of the design and site development review procedure and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

     (c)    Conformity of building permit plans to site plan review approval. Any application for a building permit subject to this section shall be reviewed by the Community Development Department for a determination as to whether such application conforms to the prior design and site development review approval by the Planning Commission. In order that such determination can be made, the building permit application shall incorporate the information and materials required by this section. No building permit shall be issued unless the Community Development Department determines that such permit conforms to such design and site development review approval. (§ 5, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2321 Effective date and expiration.
     (a)    Effective date. A site plan approval shall become effective after an elapsed period of ten (10) days from the date of the decision by the Planning Commission unless an appeal of the decision is filed pursuant to the appeals procedure provided in Part 6 of Article 23 of this chapter.

     (b)    Time limit. A site plan review approval shall expire twenty-four (24) months after the effective date of the approval, unless a building permit has been issued for the project. A site plan review approval shall expire upon expiration of a building permit which has been issued in accordance with this chapter.

     (c)    Extensions. When an applicant desires an extension of a site plan review approval, and the approval is not coupled with a tentative tract map or parcel map, the provisions of Section 9-3.2311 shall apply. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9-3.2311, when an applicant desires to be granted an extension of a site plan review approval, and the approval is coupled with a tentative tract map or parcel map, the Planning Commission at its sole discretion may grant an extension of time not to exceed the life of the map including any extensions approved by the City or by state law. The application to file an extension for a site plan review approval must be filed on a form as provided by the City and must be completed and filed with the City prior to the expiration of said permit including any applicable processing fee. (§ 5, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014, as amended by § 7, Ord. 1137, eff. October 2, 2015)

 

Part 3. Administrative Permits
Sec. 9-3.2322 Administrative permits and use permits: Purpose.
     The administrative permit and use permit processes provide for uses that cannot be readily classified as principally permitted uses in individual zones. Because of their unusual characteristics, these uses require special review and control so that they may be located and developed properly with respect to the objectives of this Code and to their effects on surrounding properties.

     Land uses that require an administrative permit are less likely to have as great an impact on the neighborhood and are more similar to the zone’s principally permitted uses than those land uses requiring a use permit. The review and granting of administrative permits and use permits shall be a discretionary administrative action. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 198, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2323 Administrative permit: Review and notice.
     The Planning Director shall review and evaluate administrative permit applications for conformance with the standards and criteria set forth in the pertinent sections of this Code.

     (a)    Action. Upon completion of the review and evaluation of an application for an administrative permit, the Planning Director, or other appropriate authority shall either:

     (1)    Make such findings or other determination as is required by the pertinent sections of this Code and approve the application; or

     (2)    Notify the applicant of the changes and modifications required for approval of the application; or

     (3)    Deny the administrative permit. The Planning Director authority shall deny the permit if:

     (A)   The permit cannot be modified or conditioned adequately to insure compliance with applicable regulations, or

     (B)    The application has caused sufficient controversy that the Planning Director believes a public hearing by the Planning Commission is appropriate, or

     (C)    The proposed development will be incompatible, injurious, or a nuisance to surrounding properties, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.

     (b)    Time period. Within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of a complete application as acknowledged by the Planning Director for an administrative permit, the Planning Director shall take such action as is specified in subsection (a) of this section. This time limit shall not apply when an administrative permit application is made concurrently with an application for a conditional use permit, variance, special exception or zone change. The twenty-one (21) day time period may be extended with the written consent of the applicant. If the Planning Director does not act within the specified time period or extension thereof, the application shall be deemed to have been denied.

     (c)    Consent of surrounding property owners. If the Planning Director determines a proposed use may be objectionable to persons living or working in the vicinity of the subject site, he/she shall require one or both of the following procedures:

     (1)    The Planning Director shall supply the applicant with the name and address of all property owners within three hundred (300′) feet or more of the parcel for which the application is made. He or she shall instruct the applicant to show the property owners maps, and whatever other information the Planning Director believes appropriate. The Planning Director shall direct the applicant to request the surrounding property owners to give their consent or objection to the proposed use as evidenced by their signature on a petition. The application shall not be considered complete and officially made until this consent petition is completed.

     (2)    The Planning Director shall mail a notice, postage prepaid, to all persons whose names appear on the last adopted Assessor’s roll of Merced County as owning property within three hundred (300′) feet or more of the parcel for which the application is made. Such notice shall identify the subject site, describe the proposed project, and define the manner and time within which written comments may be submitted to the Planning Director on said use. The Planning Director shall consider such written comments in evaluating the use and prior to taking action on the application. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 199, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2324 Administrative permit: Relationship to other applications.
     If an application for an administrative permit is submitted concurrently with another discretionary permit or zone change related to the same property, then the administrative permit shall be decided by the body having jurisdiction over the other application, and shall be reviewed and decided concurrently with such other application. A use permit may include authorization for any use, structure, or action for which an administrative permit is required, in which case no administrative permit is required. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Part 4. Use Permits
Sec. 9-3.2325 Use permits: Hearing and notice.
     All applications for granting a use permit and all actions to revoke or modify a use permit shall be heard at a public hearing noticed as provided for by this Code.

     Following the hearing on an application for granting a use permit, the Planning Commission shall by resolution deny the use permit or shall grant or modify the use permit subject to specified conditions as may be imposed. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2326 Use permits: Required findings.
     (a)    Before any use permit may be granted, the Planning Commission shall make the following findings:

     (1)    That the proposed use and project is consistent with the City of Los Banos general plan, and this Code;

     (2)    That the proposed use or project will not be a nuisance or detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use;

     (3)    That the proposed use is compatible with the adjacent uses, properties and neighborhoods and will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.

     (b)    Required findings for on-sale and off-sale alcoholic beverages. A use permit is required for any establishment dispensing for sale or other consideration alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, for on-sale or off-sale. Such use permit may be granted only upon a determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section and to all of the following use permit criteria.

     (1)    That the proposal will not contribute to undue proliferation of such uses in an area where additional ones would be undesirable with consideration given to the area’s function and character, problems of crime and loitering, and traffic problems and capacity;

     (2)    That the proposal will not adversely affect adjacent or nearby churches, temples, or synagogues; public, parochial, or private elementary, junior high, or high schools; public parks or recreation centers; or public or parochial playgrounds;

     (3)    That the proposal will not interfere with the movement of people along an important pedestrian street; and

     (4)    That where the proposed use is in close proximity to residential uses, and especially to bedroom windows, the use will be limited in hours of operation, or designed and operated so as to avoid the disruption of residents’ sleep between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 201, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and §§ 2, 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Part 5. Variances
Sec. 9-3.2327 Variances: Purpose.
     Variances from the terms of this Code may be granted only when application of this Code uniformly for an area more stringently burdens one parcel of land than others without serving the public good. For example, a triangular shaped parcel or parcel crossed by a deep ravine may qualify for a variance from a yard setback because strict application of this Code would make the lot unusable. Such special circumstances are rare. Variances are not granted in mass, or in a manner that leads to another so that eventually there is a cumulative adverse effect on the zone district. A variance is not to confer special privileges (i.e., it is only to relieve hardship, not to confer benefits) that are not enjoyed by neighboring properties under identical zoning. The hardship being relieved by a variance should not be self-induced (i.e., by the applicant’s choice of building design, or the applicant’s construction of a building in violation of this Code). A variance shall not be used to attempt to correct or circumvent the requirements of this Code which should be properly corrected through ordinance amendment or zone change. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2328 Variances: Review and notice.
     All applications for granting a variance and all actions to revoke a variance shall be heard at a public hearing noticed as provided for by the Code. Following the hearing on an application for granting a variance, the Planning Commission by resolution shall grant the variance subject to specified conditions as may be imposed or shall deny the variance. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Sec. 9-3.2329 Variances: Required findings.
     Before any variance shall be granted, the granting authority shall find that:

     (a)    Because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this Code deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by the other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classifications;

     (b)    The granting of the variance is subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant or special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which such property is situated;

     (c)    The variance does not authorize a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulations governing the parcel of property;

     (d)    That the granting of the variance would not be contrary to the intent of this chapter or to the public safety, health, and welfare; and

     (e)    That granting the variance or its modifications will not be inconsistent with the City of Los Banos general plan. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, and § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014)

 

Part 6. Appeals
Sec. 9-3.2330 Appeals: Purpose.
     (a)    The purpose of this part is to provide an orderly and fair method of appeal, rehearing or review of administrative decisions of the Planning Commission, or Community and Economic Development Director, relating to the provisions of this chapter. However, this part shall not apply where other specific procedures for appeal, rehearing, or review are established by other provisions of the Municipal Code.

     (b)    Any interested person adversely affected with an act, decision, or determination of the Planning Commission, or Community and Economic Development Director, relating to the provisions of this chapter, may appeal such act, decision, or determination by filing written notice thereof with the Community and Economic Development Director, or with the Clerk of the City of Los Banos (in the case of an appeal of a Planning Commission decision), not later than 5:00 p.m. ten (10) days after the day on which the act, decision, or determination being appealed was made. If such date falls on a weekend or City holiday, then the deadline shall be extended until 5:00 p.m. the next business day. The first day of the appeal period is the day following the action. A filing fee set by resolution of the City Council shall accompany the notice of appeal.

     (c)    The filing of the notice of appeal shall have the effect of staying the issuance of any permit, license, or entitlement until such time as the matter is disposed of on appeal.

     (d)    The notice of appeal shall state the act, decision, or determination which is being appealed, the identity of the appellant and his or her interest in the matter, and shall set forth in concise statement the reasons which, in the opinion of the appellant, render the decision made unjustified or inappropriate. (§ 1, Ord. 933, eff. September 19, 1997, as amended by § 200, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010, § 3, Ord. 1119, eff. July 18, 2014, and § 1, Ord. 1137, eff. October 2, 2015)

 

Sec. 9-3.2331 Appeals to the Planning Commission.
     (a)    The Planning Commission shall hear and decide all appeals from the actions of the Community and Economic Development Director, relating to the provisions of this chapter. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal to be heard by the Planning Commission, the Community and Economic Development Director shall set the same for hearing not later than thirty (30) days following the date the notice of appeal was filed.

Sec. 9-3.2822.1 Sign alterations, minor adjustments.
     (a)    Purpose. The Director may grant minor adjustments in order to prevent unnecessary hardships which would result from a strict and literal interpretation and enforcement of certain regulations required by this chapter. A practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures on the site, from geographic, topographic, or other physical conditions on the site, or in the immediate vicinity, or from street locations or traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity which would affect the placement of signs on the site or structure.

     (b)    Exception Purposes. The Director may grant a minor adjustment if it can be demonstrated that an exception is necessary to facilitate an improved aesthetic relationship between the signs and the structures upon which they are mounted, or to overcome an unusual site condition.

     (c)    Procedure. All minor adjustments for signs shall be referred to the Director where the applicant desires one or more adjustments from the requirements of this chapter. The Director may allow adjustments within the limits listed in this section. Appropriate findings, consistent with Section 9-3.2323 of this chapter, shall be made a part of the granting of the adjustment. The Director may in his or her sole discretion require the applicant to process the adjustment as a use permit requiring a public hearing before the Planning Commission.

     (1)    Sign Area. Total amount of adjustments is limited to twenty-five (25%) percent of the allowed sign area.

     (2)    Sign Height. Total amount of adjustments is limited to twenty-five (25%) percent of the allowed sign height.

     (3)    Transfer of Sign Area.

     (A)   To overcome a disadvantage because of an exceptional setback between the street and the sign or orientation of the sign location;

     (B)    To achieve an effect which is essentially architectural, graphic art, or sculptural and which, in the opinion of the Director, enhances the sign and site’s development;

     (C)    To permit more sign area in a single sign than is allowed, but less than the total allowed for the entire site, where a more orderly and concise pattern of signs will result;

     (D)   To allow a sign compatible with other conforming signs in the vicinity;

     (E)    To establish the allowable amount and location of signs when no street frontage exists or when, because of an unusual parcel shape (e.g., a flag lot), the street frontage is excessively narrow in proportion to the average width of the parcel; and

     (F)    To allow sign area to be transferred to a street building frontage when the main entrance does not face the street.

     (4)    Alternative Sign Locations.

     (A)   On Site. To transfer allowed signage from a structure wall to an allowed freestanding sign based upon the finding that the alternative location is necessary to overcome a disadvantage caused by an unfavorable orientation of the front wall to the street or parking lot or an exceptional setback;

     (B)    Parcels Not Fronting on Any Street. Under sign review, approval may be given for the placement of a sign on an access easement to a parcel not having street frontage, at a point where viewable from the adjoining public street; and

     (C)    Other. Alternative locations may be granted in order to further the intent and purpose of this chapter or where normal placement would conflict with the architectural design of a structure, including transfer of sign area on the same building.

     (5)    Alternative Types of Signs. To facilitate compatibility with the architecture of structures on the site and improve the overall appearance of the site.

     (d)    Conditions. The Community and Economic Development Director may impose reasonable conditions to mitigate any potential adverse effects on the neighborhood or surrounding area when such restrictions are deemed necessary in the interest of public health and safety.

     (e)    Appeals. The decision of the Community and Economic Development Director or designee may be appealed as provided by the appeal procedure provided in Part 6 of Article 23 of this chapter. (§ 6, Ord. 1158, eff. December 1, 2017)

     (a)    The approval of a sign review permit or sign review application shall expire one year after its effective date, unless the sign has been erected or a different expiration date is stipulated at the time of approval. Prior to the expiration of a sign review permit or sign review approval, the applicant may apply to the Planning Director for an extension of one year from the date of the expiration. The Planning Director may make minor modifications or may deny further extensions of the approved sign at the time of extension if he or she finds there has been a substantial change in circumstances.

     (b)    A sign review permit shall expire and become void if the circumstances or facts upon which the permit was granted change through some subsequent action by the owner or lessee so that the review permit would not be permitted under the new circumstances.

Sec. 9-3.2824 Revocation.
     Upon due notice to the applicant, any sign review permit heretofore or hereafter granted may be revoked if the Planning Director determines that the sign or sign program for which the permit was granted:

     (a)    Advertises the availability or sale of goods, property, or services no longer available; or

     (b)    Is not constructed, installed, or maintained in accordance with the approved application.

     (a)    When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that conforms to the density bonus requirements of Section 9-3403, and includes a child care facility other than a large or small family day care home that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to the project, the development shall be eligible for the following additional bonus and incentives.

     (b)    City shall grant to eligible housing developments either of the following:

     (1)    An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility; or

     (d)    Notwithstanding the above requirements, the City shall not be required to provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility in compliance with this section if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. (§ 2, Ord. 1028, eff. May 6, 2005, as amended by §§ 275, 279, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010; § 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3408 Condominium conversions.
     (a)    The City shall grant either a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value if the applicant for a condominium conversion agrees to provide thirty-three (33%) percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project as target units affordable to lower or moderate income households, or to provide fifteen (15%) percent of the total units in the condominium conversion project as target units affordable to lower income households, and to provide any replacement affordable units required by Section 9-3.3403. All such target units shall remain affordable for the period specified in Section 9-3.3404.

     (b)    For purposes of this section, a “density bonus” means an increase in units of twenty-five (25%) percent over the number of apartments to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion. “Other incentives of equivalent financial value” shall not be construed to require the City to provide a cash transfer payment or other monetary compensation of any type but may include, at the City’s discretion, modification of requirements that the City might otherwise apply as conditions of approval.

     (d)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the City to approve a condominium conversion. (§ 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3409 City discretion.
     (a)    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit the City from granting a density bonus greater than what is described in this article for a development that meets the requirements of this article, or from granting a proportionately lower density bonus than what is required by this article for developments that do not meet the requirements of this article.

     (b)    Circumstances may arise in which the public interest would be served by allowing some or all of the target units associated with one housing development to be produced and operated at an alternative development site. Where the developer and the City form such an agreement, the resulting linked developments shall be considered a single housing development for purposes of this article. Under these circumstances, the developer shall be subject to the same requirements of this article for the target units to be provided on the alternative site. (§ 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3410 Incentives and concessions.

     (c)    The City shall grant an incentive or concession request that complies with this section unless the City makes either of the following findings in writing, based upon substantial evidence:

 

     (1)    The concession or incentive does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions, consistent with Government Code 65915(k), to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Government Code 65915(c) and this article.

     (2)    The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.

     (3)    The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law.

     (d)    This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the City, or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements.

     (e)    The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval. (§ 2, Ord. 1028, eff. May 6, 2005, as amended by §§ 275, 281, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010; § 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3411 Waiver or reductions of development standards.
     (a)    An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of 9-3.3403 at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under this article, and may request a meeting with the City.

     (b)    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in California Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.

     (c)    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards that would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, or to grant any waiver or reduction that would be contrary to State or Federal law.

     (d)    A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to this article. (§ 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3412 Parking adjustment/modification in density bonus projects.
     (a)    Upon the request of the applicant, the City will not require a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, of a development meeting the criteria of Section 9-3.3403 that exceeds the following ratios:

     (1)    Zero to one bedrooms: one onsite parking space.

     (2)    Two (2) to three bedrooms: two (2) onsite parking spaces.

     (3)    Four (4) and more bedrooms: two and one-half (2½) parking spaces.

     (b)    The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed .5 onsite parking spaces per bedroom, for a development meeting the criteria of Section 9-3.3403, that is located within .5 miles of a major transit stop, and has unobstructed access to the major transit stop.

     (c)    The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed.5 onsite parking spaces per unit for a development that consists solely of rental units (exclusive of a manager’s unit)          with an affordable housing cost to lower income households, and is either:

     (1)    Located within .5 miles of a major transit stop, and has unobstructed access to the major transit stop; or

     (2)    A for rent housing development for individuals who are sixty-two (62) years of age or older that complies with Sections 51.2 and 51.3 of the California Civil Code, and has either paratransit service, or unobstructed access to a fixed bus route service that is within .5 miles and operates at least eight (8) times per day.

     (d)    The applicant may apply for a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that does not exceed .3 onsite parking spaces per unit, for a development that consists solely of rental units (exclusive of a manager’s unit) with an affordable housing cost to lower income households, and is a special needs housing development, and has either paratransit service, or unobstructed access to a fixed bus route service that is within .5 miles and operates at least eight (8) times per day.

     (e)    If the total number of parking spaces required for a development is other than a whole number, the number will be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a development may provide “onsite parking” through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking.

     (f)     This section applies to a development that meets the requirements of Section 9-3.3403, but only at the request of the applicant. An applicant may request additional parking incentives or concessions beyond those provided in this section, subject to Section 9-3.3410.

     (g)    Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c) and (d), if the City or an independent consultant has conducted an area-wide or jurisdiction-wide parking study in the last seven (7) years, then the City may impose a higher vehicular parking ratio, not to exceed the ratio described in subsection (a), based upon substantial evidence found in the parking study that includes an analysis of parking availability, differing levels of transit access, walkability access to transit services, the potential for shared parking, the effect of parking requirements on the cost of market-rate and subsidized developments, and the lower rates of car ownership for low and very low income individuals, including seniors and special needs individuals. The City will pay the costs of any new study. The City may make findings, based on a parking study completed in conformity with this section, supporting the need for the higher parking ratio.

     (5)    Description of any recorded covenant, ordinance, or law applicable to the site that restricted rents to levels affordable to very low or lower income households in the five (5)-year period preceding the date of submittal of the application.

     (6)    Description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards.

     (7)    For all incentives and concessions except mixed-use development, to establish eligibility for the requested incentives and concessions, the application shall include evidence that the requested incentives and concessions result in identifiable and actual cost reductions, including the actual cost reduction achieved through the incentive, and evidence that the cost reduction allows the applicant to provide affordable rents or affordable ownership costs.

     (8)    If a mixed-use building or project is proposed as an incentive, the applicant shall provide evidence that nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the residential project, and that the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the residential project and the existing or planned surrounding development.

     (9)    For waivers or modifications of development standards, the application shall provide evidence that the development standard for which the waiver is requested will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development with the density bonus and incentives requested.

     (c)    In accordance with State law, neither the granting of a concession or incentive, nor the granting of a density bonus, shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, variance, or other discretionary approval.

     (d)    The review process for a density bonus project shall be the same as that required for associated discretionary permits. Discretionary actions on density bonus projects shall be subject to the same appeal process applied to associated discretionary permits.

     (e)    The application and approval of a density bonus and any associated incentives or concessions shall not require a separate permit or approval process from that otherwise required for the same project without a density bonus request.

     (f)     The granting of a density bonus shall not, in and of itself, require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zone change, or other discretionary action, including the otherwise required conditional use permit necessary to exceed the base density of a given General Plan Land Use designation category or zoning district. (§ 2, Ord. 1028, eff. May 6, 2005, as amended by §§ 275, 282, Ord. 1095, eff. November 20, 2010; § 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

November 20, 2010; § 1, Ord. 1175, eff. December 6, 2019)

 

Sec. 9-3.3415 Commercial development density bonus.
     (a)    When an applicant for approval of a commercial development has entered into an agreement for partnered housing to contribute affordable housing through a joint project or two (2) separate projects encompassing affordable housing, the City will grant the commercial developer a development bonus as described in this section.

     (b)    The commercial developer must enter into an agreement for partnered housing between a commercial developer and a housing developer that is approved by the City, and identifies how the commercial developer will contribute affordable housing within the City.

     (3)    The sole purpose of the event is advertising of any product, goods, wares, merchandise or event, and is designed to be held for private profit.

     (4)    Another special event permit application has been received prior in time, or has already been approved to hold another event at the same time and place requested by the applicant, or so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both events.

     (5)    The time, route or size of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to traffic congestion.

     (6)    The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around an event, will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the event.

     (7)    The event will require the diversion of public safety or other City employees from their normal duties, so as to unreasonably reduce adequate levels of service or municipal functions to any other portion of the City.

     (8)    The location of the event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the City streets or a previously granted encroachment permit.

     (9)    The event shall occur at a time when a school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof.

     (13)  The event will substantially interrupt public transportation, or other vehicular and pedestrian traffic, in the area of its location.

     (b)    When the grounds for denial of an application for permit are any of those specified in subsection (a)(1) through (13) of this section, can be corrected by altering the date, time duration, route or location of the event, or imposition of conditions, the Community and Economic Development Director shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application upon the applicant’s acceptance of conditions for permit issuance.

     (c)    If the City Manager determines, after consultation with the City Attorney, that a particular use, event or activity does not present a substantial or significant public liability or property damage exposure for the City or its officers, agents and employees, the special events coordinator may give a written waiver of the insurance requirements of this section.

Sec. 9-3.4601 Purpose and intent.
     It is the policy of the City of Los Banos, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities. This article establishes a procedure for making request for reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures of the jurisdiction to comply fully with the intent and purpose of fair housing laws. (§ 1, Ord. 1181, eff. May 1, 2020)

 

Sec. 9-3.4602 Applicability.
     Reasonable accommodation in the land use and zoning context means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use and zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.

     An individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a record of such impairment.

     A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning or building regulation, policy, practice or procedure acts as barrier to fair housing opportunities. (§ 1, Ord. 1181, eff. May 1, 2020)

 

Sec. 9-3.4603 Notice to the public of availability of accommodation process.
     Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at the public information counter in the Community and Economic Development Department, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals.

     (2)    Name and address of the property owner(s);

     (3)    Address of the property for which accommodation is requested;

     (4)    Description of the requested accommodation and the regulation(s), policy or procedure for which accommodation is sought; and

     (5)    Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with the disability to use and enjoy the dwelling.

     (c)    Any information identified by an applicant as confidential shall be retained in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be made available for public inspection.

     (d)    A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual’s obligation to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.

     (e)    If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the jurisdiction will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. (§ 1, Ord. 1181, eff. May 1, 2020)

In the event that a request for additional information is made, the thirty (30) day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request. (§ 1, Ord. 1181, eff. May 1, 2020)

 

Sec. 9-3.4606 Required findings.
     The written decision to grant, grant modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with fair housing laws and based on the following factors:

     (a)    Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual with disabilities protected under fair housing laws;

     (b)    Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws;

     (c)    Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the jurisdiction; and

     (d)    Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the jurisdiction’s land use and zoning or building program. (§ 1, Ord. 1181, eff. May 1, 2020)

Chapter 5 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES
Article 1. General Provisions
Sec. 9-5.101 Purpose.

Chapter 6 CITY OF LOS BANOS WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE
Note
*    Editor’s note: Chapter 9-6 was renumbered from Chapter 10-2 by Ord. 1156.

Note
**  Prior ordinance history: Ords. 863, 1059 and 1090.

 

Sec. 9-6.01 Purpose.
     (a)    The State Legislature has found:

     (1)    That the waters of the State are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;

     (2)    That the continuation of California’s economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;

     (3)    That it is the policy of the State to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;

     (4)    That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;

     (5)    That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient; and

     (6)    That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.

     (b)    Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this chapter is to:

     (1)    Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;

     (2)    Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible;

     (3)    Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes;

     (4)    Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;

     (5)    Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies; and

     (6)    Encourage the use of economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water.

     (c)    Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this chapter, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:

     (1)    Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits.

     (2)    Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.

     (3)    Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.

     (4)    Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.

     (5)    Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action. (§ 1, Ord. 1156, eff. July 7, 2017)

 

Sec. 9-6.01.01 Applicability.
     (a)    This chapter shall apply to all of the following landscape projects:

Sec. 9-6.03.07 Irrigation design plan.
     (a)    This section applies to landscaped areas requiring permanent irrigation, not areas that require temporary irrigation solely for the plant establishment period. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers’ recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of the Landscape Documentation Package.

     (1)    System.

     (A)   Landscape water meters defined as a dedicated water service meter shall be installed for all non-residential irrigated landscapes of one thousand (1,000) square feet but not more than five thousand (5,000) square feet (the level at which Water Code Section 535 applies) and residential irrigated landscapes of five thousand (5,000) square feet or greater. A landscape water meter may be only a customer service meter dedicated to landscape use provided by the Public Works Department and paid for by the property owner.

     (B)    Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data and non-volatile memory shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.

     (C)    If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the manufacturer’s recommended pressure range for optimal performance.

     (i)     If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices such as inline pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.

     (ii)    Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure. and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be conducted at installation.

     (D)   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind), either integral or auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing weather or during rain.

     (E)    Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair.

     (F)    Approved backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant shall refer to the City of Los Banos Standards and Specifications for additional backflow prevention requirements.

     (G)   Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system damage or malfunction are required for all on non-residential landscapes and residential landscapes of five thousand (5,000) square feet or larger.

     (H)   Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual control of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped with low pressure shut down features.

     (I)     The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures.

     (N)   It is highly recommended that the project applicant inquire with the Public Works Department about peak water operating demands (on the water supply system) and water restrictions that may impact the effectiveness of the irrigation system.

     (O)   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.

     (P)    Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s recommendations.

     (Q)   Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using the manufacturer’s recommendations.

     (a)    Any person, firm, or corporation owning or occupying real property bordering on any street where trees have branches, limbs, trunks or other parts projecting into the public right-of-way shall prune such trees or keep them trimmed in such a manner that they will not obstruct or shade streetlights, obstruct or interfere with the passage of pedestrians on sidewalks, obstruct the vision of traffic signs or obstruct the views of any street or alley intersection.

     (b)    Any person owning or occupying real property bordering on any street, park or other public property, on which there may be trees that are diseased or insect infested, shall remove, spray or treat any such trees in a manner that will not infect or damage nearby public vegetation or cause harm to the community or citizens therein. (§ 1, Ord. 1085, eff. December 5, 2008)

 

Sec. 10-1.08 Protection of trees during building construction, repairs, or removal.
     During the erection, repair, alteration, or removal of any building, house, or structure in the City no person in charge of such work shall leave any tree, shrub, or plant in any street, park, pleasure ground, boulevard, alley, public right-of-way, street tree easement or public place in the City in the vicinity of such building or structure without such good and sufficient guards or protectors as shall prevent injuries to such tree, shrub, or plant arising out of or by reason of such erection, repair, alteration, or removal.

     For the purpose of safeguarding trees during construction, the following conditions shall apply:

     (a)    Damage to any tree during construction shall be immediately reported to the Director by any person causing such damage, the responsible contractor, or the owner of the site and such persons shall be required to treat the tree for such damages as specified by the Director;

     (b)    Oil, gasoline, chemicals and other construction materials or equipment which might be harmful to trees shall not be stored under the drip line or upslope of the tree(s);

     (c)    Drains shall be installed according to City specifications so as to avoid harm to the tree due to excess watering;

     (d)    Cutting and filling around the base of the tree shall be done only after consultation with the Director and then only to the extent authorized. The Director may require professional consultation, at the applicant’s cost, to make appropriate determinations;

     (e)    No paint thinner, paint, plaster or other liquid or solid excess or waste construction materials or waste water shall be dumped on the ground or into any grate between the drip line and the base of the tree or uphill from any tree where such substance might reach the roots through a leaching process;

     (f)     Tree protection fences (minimum three (3′) foot high visibility fence with metal posts at minimum every ten (10′) feet) shall be installed at the drip line to prevent compaction and injury to a tree’s surface roots to prevent exposing the trees to disease causing organisms;

     (g)    Wherever cuts are made in the ground near the roots of a tree, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent exposed soil from drying out and causing damage thereto. All cuts within the drip line of a tree are to be made by hand (no backhoes or graders);

     (h)    Trimming cuts one inch in diameter and over must be covered at the time the cuts are made with a tree seal pruning compound approved by the Director. All root pruning is to be done by hand. (§ 1, Ord. 1085, eff. December 5, 2008)

 

Sec. 10-1.09 The designation and protection of heritage trees.
     The following standards shall govern the treatment of Heritage Trees.

     (a)    Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to protect certain trees in order to preserve cultural heritage, maintain and enhance the scenic beauty of the community, to provide shade, improve air quality, assist in abating soil and slope erosion and preserve and enhance property values, thus promoting the public health, safety and welfare.

     (b)    Applicability. These regulations regulate the maintenance and removal of trees that are sited on private property.

     (c)    Heritage Tree defined. As used in this section “Heritage Tree” means, upon nomination by any person and with the written consent of the property owner(s), any tree or group of trees recommended by the Parks and Recreation Commission and identified by City Council resolution upon a finding that the tree or group of trees is:

     (1)    Of historic value because of its association with a place, building, natural feature or event of local, regional, national or historic significance; or

     (2)    Identified on any historic or cultural resources survey as a significant feature of a landmark, historic site or historic district; or

     (3)    Representative of a significant period of the City’s growth or development and was the result of a planting dedicated by citizens, civic groups or the City; or

     (4)    Identified because of its age, beauty, and/or uniqueness, especially if representative of a species that has significance in natural history and/or ecology.

     After City Council approval of a Heritage Tree designation, the City Clerk shall notify the property owner(s) in writing. A listing of trees so designated as a Heritage Tree, including the specific locations thereof, shall be kept by the Public Works and Planning Departments. Once designated, a Heritage Tree shall be subject to the provisions of this section unless removed from the list of Heritage Trees by action of the City Council. The City Council may remove a tree from the list upon its own motion or upon written request by the property owner.

     (d)    Maintenance and preservation of Heritage Trees. Any person who owns, controls, has custody or possession of any real property within the City shall use reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve all Heritage Trees located thereon in a state of good health pursuant to the provisions of this section. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this section. Any person who conducts any grading, excavation, demolition or construction activity on property shall do so in such a manner as to not threaten the health or viability or cause the removal of any Heritage Tree. Any work performed within a radius of ten (10) times the diameter of the tree from the center of the trunk (i.e., the tree protection zone) shall require submittal of a tree protection plan for review and approval by the Director of Public Works or designee prior to issuance of any permit for grading or construction. The tree protection plan shall be prepared by a certified arborist and shall address issues related to protective fencing and protective techniques to minimize impacts associated with grading, excavation, demolition and construction. The Director of Public Works or designee may impose conditions on any City permit to assure compliance with this section.

     (e)    Removal and major pruning of Heritage Trees prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to remove, or cause to be removed any Heritage Tree from any parcel of property in the City, or prune more than one-fourth (1/4) of the branches or roots within a twelve (12) month period, without obtaining a permit; provided, that in case of emergency, when a tree is imminently hazardous or dangerous to life or property, it may be removed by order of the Police Chief, Fire Chief, the Director of Public Works or their respective designees. Any person who vandalizes, grievously mutilates, destroys or unbalances a Heritage Tree without a permit or beyond the scope of an approved permit shall be in violation of this section.

     (f)     Tree permit required. Any person desiring to remove one or more Heritage Trees or perform major pruning shall apply for a permit pursuant to procedures established by the Director of Public Works and shall pay a fee established by the City Council. It is the joint responsibility of the property owner and party removing the Heritage Tree or trees, or portions thereof to obtain the permit. The Director of Public Works or designee may only issue a permit for the removal or major pruning of a Heritage Tree if he or she determines there is good cause for such action. In determining whether there is good cause, the Director of Public Works or designee shall give consideration to the following:

     (1)    The condition of the tree or trees with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with utility services;

     (2)    The necessity to remove the tree or trees in order to construct proposed improvements to the property;

     (3)    The topography of the land and the effect of the removal of the tree on erosion, soil retention and diversion or increased flow of surface waters;

     (4)    The long-term value of the species under consideration, particularly lifespan and growth rate;

     (5)    The ecological value of the tree or group of trees, such as food, nesting, habitat, protection and shade for wildlife or other plant species;

     (6)    The number, size, species, age distribution and location of existing trees in the area and the effect the removal would have upon shade, privacy impact and scenic beauty;

     (7)    The number of trees the particular parcel can adequately support according to good arboricultural practices;

     (8)    The availability of reasonable and feasible alternatives that would allow for the preservation of the tree(s).

     (g)    Hearings and appeals. Hearings and appeals of the decision of the Public Works Director or designee shall be conducted in the same manner as provided by Sections 9-3.2226 through 9-3.2228.

     (h)    Exceptions. Tree permits are not required and trees may be removed in compliance with the provisions of this section under the following provisions:

     (1)    Removal of any tree on private property not classified or listed as a Heritage Tree;

     (2)    Routine maintenance, including trimming of street trees and trimming of trees on private property by a utility company licensed by the Public Utilities Commission to maintain required clearances around utility installations;

     (3)    Emergency circumstances, if personal injury or property damage is eminently threatened in the sole judgment of the Public Works Director, Planning Director, Police Chief, Fire Chief, or City Manager;

     (4)    Removal of a Heritage Tree that is dead or so diseased or damaged that it is no longer viable, as determined by the Public Works Director.

     (i)     Heritage Tree protection guidelines. Development proposals shall protect and preserve Heritage Trees to the fullest extent possible. Care shall be exercised by all individuals, builders, contractors and others working near protected trees so that no damage occurs to such trees. The following measures shall be used to preserve and protect the health of trees to remain, relocated trees and new trees planted to replace those removed.

     (1)    All trees to be saved shall be enclosed by a construction barrier placed around the protected zone of the tree, including, but not limited to, chain link fencing or other material acceptable to the Public Works Director, prior to the issuance of any grading or building permit and prior to the commencement of work. Barriers are to remain intact until construction is complete and may not be removed without the written consent of the Planning Director.

     (2)    When proposed development or other site work is to encroach into the protected zone of a tree, special measures shall be incorporated to allow for safe and healthy conditions for protected trees.

     (3)    Any excavation, cutting, filling, paving or construction of the existing ground surface within the protected zone of a tree shall be minimized. No adverse significant change in existing ground level shall occur within the drip line of a protected tree.

     (4)    Development proposals shall be configured to retain as many Heritage and significant trees as possible.

 

     (5)    Construction equipment and material shall not be stored within tree protection areas. No oil, gas, chemicals or other substances that may be harmful to trees shall be stored or dumped within the protected zone or any other location on the site from which such substances might enter the protected zone.

     (6)    Trenching within the protected zone of trees shall be avoided wherever possible. Trenching for utilities shall avoid major roots and, if avoidance is impractical, tunnels shall be made below roots. Trenching is to be consolidated to serve as many units as possible. Trenching within the protected zone shall be done by hand to minimize impacts.

     (7)    Additional measures may be imposed by the Public Works Director to protect and preserve the health of the trees to remain, relocated trees and new trees planted to replace those that are removed.

     (j)     Enforcement—Remedies for violation. In addition to all other remedies set forth in this code or otherwise provided by law, the following remedies shall be available to the City for violation of this section:

     (1)    Civil penalties.

     (a)    As part of a civil action brought by the City, a court may assess against any person who commits, allows, or maintains a violation of any provision of this section a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed Five Thousand and No/100ths ($5,000.00) Dollars per violation.

     (b)    Where the violation has resulted in damage, mutilation, disfigurement, or removal of a tree, whether through vandalism, improper pruning, or other actions, the civil penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed Five Thousand and No/100ths ($5,000.00) Dollars per tree, or the replacement value of each such tree, whichever amount is higher. Such amount shall be payable to the City. Replacement value for the purposes of this section shall be determined utilizing the most recent edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal,” published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers.

     (2)    Injunctive relief. A civil action may be commenced to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such violation.

     (3)    Costs. In any civil action brought pursuant to this section in which the City prevails, the court shall award to the City all costs of investigation and preparation for trial, the costs of trial, reasonable expenses including administrative costs incurred in prosecuting the action, and reasonable attorney fees. (§ 1, Ord. 1091, eff. May 21, 2010)

 

Sec. 10-1.10 Interference with City employees while conducting tree planting or maintenance.
     No person shall interfere with the Public Works Director or persons acting under his authority while engaged in planting, mulching, pruning, trimming, spraying, treating, or removing any tree, shrub, or plant in any street, park, pleasure ground, boulevard, alley, public right-of-way, street tree easement or public place in the City or in the removal of any stone, cement, or other substance from about the trunk of any tree, shrub, or plant in any such street, park, pleasure ground, boulevard, alley, public right-of-way, street tree easement or public place.

Sec. 10-1.12 Impeding free access of water to trees in the public right-of-way.
     No person without the approval of the Public Works Director shall place or maintain any stone, cement, or other substance so that it shall impede the free access of water or air to the roots of any tree, shrub, or plant in any street, park, pleasure ground, boulevard, alley, public right-of-way, street tree easement or public place in the City.

Chapter 3 COMMUNITY PRESERVATION
Article I. In General
Sec. 10-3.100 Purpose and intent.
     The City has a history and reputation for well-kept properties; and property values and the general welfare of the community are founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private properties. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety, economic, aesthetic and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to protect neighborhoods against nuisances, blight and deterioration by establishing requirements for all building exteriors, whether residential or nonresidential, or structures of whatever kind, and establishing requirements for the maintenance of all land, whether improved or vacant.

     Owners and occupants of some properties within the City permit conditions to exist which are below the minimum conditions required by this Code and therefore injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City and contribute substantially and increasingly to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and commercial areas.

     The abatement of certain uses and abuses of property as described in this chapter reasonably relates to the proper exercise of police power to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.

     Abatement of conditions less than those required by this Code will promote health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City because maximum use and enjoyment of property in close proximity to another depends upon maintenance of both properties.

     This chapter shall apply to all buildings, structures and lands within the City without regard to use, date of construction or alterations. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

Article V. Regulation of Vacant and Boarded Buildings; Public Nuisance
Sec. 10-3.116 Vacant buildings; declaration of purpose.
     The Council finds that neglected, vacant buildings are a major cause of blight in residential and nonresidential neighborhoods. Vacant buildings often attract transients and criminals, including drug users and prostitutes. Use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals, who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods, creates a risk of fire for the vacant building and adjacent properties. Vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for drug paraphernalia, furniture, tires, garbage, junk and debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass creating a wide variety of health and safety concerns. In addition, vacant buildings which are simply boarded up for long periods of time with plywood or other materials to prevent entry by transients or vandals very often discourage economic development, disrupting neighborhood stability, retarding appreciation of property values and promote visual blight conditions, all of which interfere with the rights of neighboring property owners and occupants to the full use and enjoyment of their property.

     The City currently expends resources monitoring and responding to vacant buildings, because of the numerous health, welfare, safety and economic problems caused by neglected, vacant buildings. There is already a substantial cost to the City for monitoring neglected, vacant buildings (whether or not those buildings are boarded up) as well as substantial toll on the citizens who are affected by the nuisance conditions created, therefore the City Council finds there is an urgent need to refine the process by which these buildings are monitored and remediated. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.117 Boarded buildings; declaration of purpose.
     Boarded buildings are a major cause and source of crime and blight in both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods. In addition, vacant buildings which are boarded and unkempt, and which are vacant for long periods of time, discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values.

Sec. 10-3.123 Vacant building monitoring fee.
     (a)    Fee imposed. There is hereby imposed upon every owner of a vacant building an annual vacant building monitoring fee in an amount to be set by resolution of the City Council. The fee shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of monitoring the vacant building. The fee shall be payable as to any building, residential or nonresidential, which:

     (1)    Is boarded up by voluntary action of the owner or as the result of enforcement activities by the City; or

     (2)    Is vacant for more than sixty (60) days for any reason.

     (b)    Fee waiver. The vacant building monitoring fee may be waived by the Building Official upon a showing by the owner that:

     (1)    The owner has obtained a building permit and is progressing diligently to repair the premises for occupancy; or

     (2)    The building meets all applicable codes and is actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; or

     (3)    Imposition of the fee would impose a substantial economic hardship on the owner or would hinder the rehabilitation of the building.

     (c)    Procedure.

     (1)    The vacant building monitoring fee shall be billed to the owner of the property and mailed to the owner’s address as set forth on the last equalized assessment roll of the County Assessor.

     (2)    Any owner billed may apply for a waiver on the grounds set forth in subsection (b) of this section by submitting a written statement of the grounds for the waiver, and the owner’s daytime telephone number, to the Building Official within thirty (30) days after the billing is mailed to the owner. The Building Official shall review the written statement and may contact the owner to discuss the application for waiver. The Building Official shall prepare a written decision which shall be mailed to the owner.

     (3)    Any owner who disagrees with the decision of the Building Official may submit a written notice of appeal to the Building Official within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the decision. Failure to timely appeal the decision of the Building Official relating to a denial of a waiver constitutes a waiver of all rights to an administrative hearing and determination of the matter subject only to review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5.

     (4)    If the fee is not paid within sixty (60) days after billing, or within sixty (60) days after the decision of the Building Official or after the decision upon appeal by the owner becomes final, the fee may be specially assessed against the property involved and made a personal obligation of the owner. If the fee is to be specially assessed against the property, a Hearing Officer, as designated by the City Manager, shall confirm the assessment and thereafter said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property taxes are applicable to the special assessment.

     (5)    The designated Hearing Officer may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, a description of the real property subject to the lien, and the amount of the fee.

Article VI. Nuisance; Creating Behaviors
Sec. 10-3.124 Findings.
     The City Council finds as follows:

     (a)    Just as the physical conditions of properties within the City can constitute public and private nuisances, so too the behavior of persons on properties within the City can constitute public and private nuisances. Examples of behavior which can constitute nuisances include large and noisy gatherings, noisy activities during late-night hours, use or sale of controlled substances on premises, and the coming and going of persons with the intent to purchase controlled substances.

     (b)    It is as important for the public health, safety and welfare for interested residents of the City or the City itself to be able to abate nuisance-creating behaviors as it is to abate nuisance-creating physical conditions.

     (c)    The owners of properties within the City are responsible to monitor their properties and to take appropriate action if a nuisance exists thereon, whether that nuisance be created by existing physical conditions or by nuisance-creating behaviors. Such nuisances can be avoided with adequate property management. If a property owner does not fulfill his or her responsibilities, it is necessary for the safety, health, and welfare of neighborhoods and the City as a whole that interested persons or the City be able to undertake abatement action. An abatement remedy for nuisance-created behaviors is needed.

     (d)    Neighborhood health and safety must be protected in a way which does not promote housing discrimination or promote evictions based on prejudice, unfounded fears or personal animosities.

     (e)    Nothing in the ordinance codified in this chapter exempts property owners from strict compliance with State Housing Law on evictions, retaliatory conduct or discriminatory conduct or privacy. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.125 Purpose.
     (a)    The purpose of this section is:

     (1)    To set forth and make enforceable minimum standards for the management of human behavior on residential properties and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and

     (2)    To put in place a remedy which will permit aggrieved persons or the City to take effective, efficient judicial or administrative action against property owners who permit nuisance-creating behaviors to occur on their properties on a continuing basis, in order to compel such owners to abate the nuisance-creating behaviors.

     (b)    Provisions of this chapter are intended to be supplementary and complementary to all of the other provisions of this Code and State law and all remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative to other remedies which may be available under the Code or State law. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.126 Application.
     (a)    The provisions of this chapter shall apply generally to all property throughout the City wherein any of the nuisances hereinafter specified, are found to exist; provided, however, that any condition which would constitute a violation of this chapter, but which is duly authorized under any specific City, State or Federal statute, shall not be deemed to violate this chapter.

     (b)    The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to activities which constitute a bona fide exercise of constitutional rights. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.127 Responsibility for proper property management.
     (a)    Every owner of real property within the City and every person responsible for the management of real property within the City is required to manage the property in a manner that does not violate the provisions of this Code. The owner shall remain liable for violations thereof regardless of any contract or agreement with any third party regarding the management or control of property.

     (b)    Every responsible party or owner of real property in the City is required to behave on the property, and supervise anyone on the property, in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of this Code. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.128 Generally.
     It is hereby declared a public nuisance and a violation of this Code for any responsible party or owner of any premises in this City to permit their premises to be used in such a manner that any one or more of the activities described in the following subsections are found to occur repeatedly thereon:

     (a)    The illegal sale of controlled or illegal drugs or substances;

     (b)    The illegal use of controlled substances and other illegal drugs or substances;

     (c)    The frequent gathering, or coming and going, of people who have an intent to purchase or use controlled substances or other illegal drugs or substances on the premises;

     (d)    The occurrence of prostitution;

     (e)    Unlawful activities of a criminal street gang (as defined in Penal Code Section 186.22);

     (f)     The making or continuing, or causing to be made and continued, of any loud, unnecessary or unusual noise which disturbs the peace and quiet of the neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to more than one reasonable person of normal sensitivity residing in the area. This section shall only become effective when the Police Department has documented more than three (3) calls for service over any ninety (90) day period to the same address and/or dwelling in relation to making or continuing, or causing to be made and continued, any loud unnecessary and unusual noise which disturbs the peace and quiet of the neighborhood;

     (g)    The firing of gunshots or brandishing of weapons by a resident of the premises, or by a guest of a resident;

     (h)    The use of property to provide shelter to or seclusion of any action, act, or occurrence which is a crime under Federal, State, or local laws. To provide such shelter shall be to harbor a public nuisance, and shall be unlawful. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.129 Administrative enforcement action.
     (a)    Whenever an Enforcement Officer has inspected any premises and determined that the premises are in violation of this chapter, that Officer may issue a notice and order to abate the nuisance.

     (b)    No notice and order is required to be issued hereunder if the owner is making good faith efforts to abate the nuisance. Indicia of good faith may include prompt responses to City communications and requests, cooperation with Enforcement Officers, active professional property management, and taking steps to repair physical conditions which contribute to the nuisance.

(c) (1)   Whenever an Enforcement Officer issues a notice and order pursuant to this chapter to an owner or responsible party for rental residential property regarding a nuisance that exists at their property, the Officer shall concurrently issue a written notice to the tenants of the property who may also be deemed violators by that Officer. The notice shall generally describe the nuisance and the City’s remedies under this Code. The notice shall also state that tenants may contact the Officer to provide or receive information about their building. Notice to the tenant or unit need not be given when the Enforcement Officer determines that doing so would endanger persons or compromise an ongoing police investigation.

     (2)    The Enforcement Officer shall follow reasonable procedures intended to provide all tenants with notice of subsequent proceedings and actions pursuant to this chapter, but failure of any tenant to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the City.

     (d)    After the time for abatement set forth in the notice and order has expired, the Enforcement Officer shall determine whether the owner has taken the action ordered by the Officer and whether the nuisance has been abated. If the Officer determines that the nuisance has been abated, the owner and any occupants other than the owner shall be notified in writing of such determination and the compliance order shall be void thereafter.

     (e)    If the Enforcement Officer determines that the nuisance has not been abated and no written appeal has been received within the time specified in the notice and order, the compliance order shall become final except for the appropriate assessment of administrative penalties and costs against an owner or responsible party, which assessment only may be appealed and heard by a Hearing Officer if a written appeal is received by the Director within fifteen (15) days of the assessment. If an appeal is received, the Director shall set a hearing before a Hearing Officer. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

 

Sec. 10-3.130 Remedies.
     (a)    The administrative enforcement procedure described in Section 10-3.121 notwithstanding, the City Attorney may, in addition to or alternatively to that procedure, bring a civil action for injunctive relief and seek civil penalties in an amount not to exceed Twenty Thousand and No/100ths ($20,000.00) Dollars against any owner or responsible party who violates this Code.

Article VII. Defacement of Property
Sec. 10-3.131 Purpose.
     The purpose of this legislation is to provide programs for removal of graffiti from public and private property within the City and to establish regulations designed to prevent and control the spread of graffiti in Los Banos. The City Council finds and determines that the increase of graffiti on both public and private buildings, structures, and in other places, creates a condition of blight within the City which can result in the deterioration of property values, business opportunities, and enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding properties. The Council further finds and determines that graffiti is inconsistent with the City’s property maintenance goals, crime prevention programs, and aesthetic standards, and, unless graffiti is quickly removed from public and private properties, other properties soon become the targets of graffiti. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

     (b)    Where there has been a conviction, or guilty or nolo contendere plea of a violation of this article, the court shall, in addition to any penalty imposed pursuant to this article, and at the City’s option, order the defendant to complete community service, including graffiti removal service, of not less than six (6) hours and no more than forty-eight (48) hours for a first conviction.

Sec. 10-3.137 Removal of graffiti.
     (a)    Right of City to require removal by responsible party. It is unlawful for any responsible party to permit property that has been defaced with graffiti to remain so defaced for a period of three (3) calendar days after having been given notice of the violation of this section.

     (b)    Consent to enter; abatement upon failure to obtain consent.

If a responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time herein specified or if the responsible party has refused to give consent to the City for entry on terms acceptable to the City consistent with the provisions of this section, the City may commence abatement of graffiti nuisance and recovery of expense of abatement proceedings for the removal of the graffiti according to the procedures herein. (§ 2, Ord. 1059, eff. December 7, 2007)

Following notice, the hearing shall be held by the Hearing Officer at the time, date and place designated and at such hearing the responsible party may be heard and provided with the opportunity to show cause why the nuisance should not be abated. Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether abatement of the nuisance shall be commenced.

     (2)    If the Hearing Officer determines that abatement of the nuisance shall be commenced, the City may enter upon the property and cause such nuisance to be removed in the manner determined most appropriate by the City.

     (3)    If a hearing has not been requested by the responsible party, the City may enter upon the property and cause such nuisance to be removed in the manner determined most appropriate by the City.

     (4)    Upon removal of the public nuisance, the City may provide an accounting of the expense of abatement along with a demand for payment to the responsible party.

     (5)    If payment is not made within thirty (30) days from the date of the accounting and demand for payment, the payment shall be deemed delinquent and shall be subject to a penalty assessment of One Hundred and No/100ths ($100.00) Dollars plus interest on the unpaid amount plus penalty, which interest shall accrue at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2%) percent per month until paid.

Following notice, the hearing shall be held by the Hearing Officer at the time, date and place designated and at such hearing the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor may each be heard and provided with the opportunity to show cause why the City should not recover the expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether the City should recover expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor.

     (2)    If the Hearing Officer determines that the City should recover the expense of abatement from the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, the City may provide an accounting of the expense of abatement along with a demand for payment to the minor and the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor.

     (4)    In the event the expense of abatement has not been paid within thirty (30) days from the date of issuing an accounting and demand for payment, the amount unpaid including any penalty and interest therein, shall constitute a lien pursuant to Government Code Sections 38772 and 38773.2 against the property of the minor and against the property of the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. Prior to recording a notice of lien, the Hearing Officer shall provide notice pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.2. Any such lien not paid by June 30th of each year shall, upon adoption of a resolution by the City Council, be collected along with, and in the same manner as, the general property taxes. The liened property shall be subject to the penalties, procedures, and sale in case of delinquency as provided in the Civil Code of California.

     (5)    As an alternative to a lien and pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.6, the expense of abatement shall constitute a special assessment against a parcel of land owned by the minor or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor.

Chapter 6 AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION
Sec. 11-6.01 Purpose and findings.
     (a)    The purpose of this chapter is to improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the city, and to protect the safety of the general public against certain abusive conduct of persons engaged in solicitation, by imposing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens.

     (b)    The City Council of the City of Los Banos finds:

     (1)    The maintenance and improvement of the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Los Banos are significant government interests.

     (2)    The protection of the citizens of the City of Los Banos from the danger of assault, battery, theft and disturbances of the peace, as well as other crimes, is also a significant government interest.

     (3)    Aggressive and abusive solicitations threaten these significant government interests by diminishing access to an enjoyment of public places, threatening the commercial well being of local businesses, and creating an environment of fear, intimidation, and confrontation.

     (4)    Citizens of the City of Los Banos are involuntarily subjected to aggressive and abusive solicitations for monetary or other donations, which cause them to feel threatened, intimidated, and coerced. Such conduct usually includes approaching and following persons, repeated requests for donations, unwanted physical contact, abusive language and threats, and obstruction of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

     (5)    Aggressive and abusive solicitations increase the risk of assault, battery, theft, disturbing the peace, and other crimes. Such solicitations can provoke confrontations due to the threatening and offensive nature of the conduct of the solicitor. These situations put not only the solicited person, but also the solicitor, at risk of being the victim of assaultive and criminal conduct.

     (6)    Solicitation during the hours of darkness is inherently more threatening and intimidating, than during daylight hours.

     (7)    The content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions on aggressive and abusive solicitations as narrowly tailored in this chapter serve these significant government interests.

     (3)    Security guards shall be charged with preventing violations of law and enforcing compliance by patrons of the requirements of these regulations.

Sec. 11-15.405 Certain conduct in bars prohibited.

Accordingly, the following acts or conduct on the premises of any bar are deemed contrary to the public interest and welfare and the best interests of the community and, therefore:

     (a)    No bar owner or operator or an employee thereof shall permit any person on the premises to display or expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, anal region, or any portion of the female breast at or below the areola thereof;
