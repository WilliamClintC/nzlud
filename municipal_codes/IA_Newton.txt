(2011 Code, § 1.0110)



§ 10.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   (1)   The provisions of Iowa Code § 364.22 are hereby
adopted by reference the same as if fully set out herein. All violations of
the code of ordinances, unless otherwise specified, shall constitute
municipal infractions as defined in Iowa Code § 364.22, and shall be subject
to the remedies specified herein. The City Administrator, or City
Administrator’s designee(s), shall enforce the provisions of these
ordinances using a form approved by the City Administrator.



         (a)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (A),
the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.



            CODE. The code of ordinances of the City of Newton,
Iowa, as may be amended from time to time.



            SUBSEQUENT OFFENSE. A subsequent offense is a
violation of the same section of the code which occurs at the same location
or at a different location more than two times.



         (b)   Schedule of penalties.



            1.   Unless another penalty or procedure is
expressly provided by the code of ordinances for any particular provision,
section or chapter, any person failing to perform a duty or obtain a license
required by, or violating any provision of the code of ordinances, or any
rule or regulation adopted herein by reference, shall be guilty of a
municipal infraction and shall be subject to the following schedule of
penalties:



 


Schedule of Penalties



First offense
 
$$50 - 250


Second offense
 
$500 - 750


Subsequent offenses
 
$750 - 1,000



 



            2.   Furthermore, should a municipal infraction
citation be filed with the courts, the defendant shall be required to appear
in that action. Should the court enter a finding in favor of the city in that
action, the court shall give consideration to ordering the defendant to abate
or correct the violation.



         (c)   Separate offense. Each day that a municipal
infraction occurs and/or is permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.



         (d)   Alternative relief. Seeking a civil penalty as
authorized by this section does not preclude the city from seeking
alternative relief from the court in the same action. Such alternative relief
may include, but is not limited to, an order for abatement or injunctive
relief.



      (2)   (a)   All code sections providing penalties which are
different from the scheduled penalties established under this section as of
the effective date of this chapter, except for all violations under division
(B) below and any violation which would be punishable as a criminal offense
under Iowa Code are hereby amended and are municipal infractions subject to
the penalties and procedures set forth under this division (A).



         (b)   Any offense under the code which does not provide
a penalty as of the effective date of this division (A) is a municipal
infraction and is subject to the penalties and procedures set forth under
this section.



         (c)   Any offense established after the effective date
of this division (A), except for violations under division (B) below unless
otherwise expressly provided, any violation which would be punishable as a
criminal offense under the Iowa Code, or any other penalty expressly
provided, shall be a municipal infraction and shall be subject to the
penalties and procedures set forth under this division (A).



      (3)   Notice of violation. All code violations which are
deemed to be municipal infractions pursuant to city code section 1.0109(A)
may initially be charged upon a simple notice of violation. The city may
serve a notice of violation upon a party charged with an act constituting a
municipal infraction either by delivering said notice personally or by
certified mail to the party's last known address.



         (a)   If the person charged admits the violation, such
person shall be subject to the penalty applicable to municipal infractions as
set forth in the schedule of penalties, unless another penalty is
specifically provided for elsewhere in the code for that particular
violation. Upon payment of the penalty to the City Clerk, or his or her
designee, and performance of any other act required by law to be performed,
the person charged shall not be further prosecuted or assessed any costs or
other expenses for such violation, and the city shall retain all penalties
collected pursuant to this section.



         (b)   Where a code violation initially charged upon a
simple notice of violation pursuant to this section is not admitted by the
person charged, or is admitted by the person charged but other acts required
to be performed were not performed, a civil municipal infraction citation
shall be served and filed with the courts in the manner prescribed by the
applicable provision(s) of this code. Such municipal infraction citation may
seek a penalty and/or additional relief to the extent permitted by law.



         (c)   This section does not impose a duty to initially
charge all municipal infractions upon simple notice, and the officer charged
with enforcement may initially issue a civil municipal infraction citation
seeking a civil penalty with or without additional relief.



(2011 Code, § 1.0109)



   (B)   (1)   General provisions. The provisions of Iowa Code §
364.22 are hereby adopted by reference the same as if fully set out herein.
Violations of the provisions of public safety provisions shall constitute
municipal infractions, as defined in said Iowa Code § 364.22, and shall be
subject to the remedies specified therein. The City Administrator, or the
City Administrator’s designee(s), shall enforce the provisions of this
division (B).



(2011 Code, § 13.0101)



      (2)   Penalties. Violation of any of the provisions, standards
or terms of any of the municipal infraction ordinances specified in public
safety provisions shall subject the user, owner, occupant or person
committing the violation to the schedule of penalties set forth in division
(A) above. Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the
violator constitutes a separate offense. A repeat violation is a violation by
the same person who has previously admitted the infraction or previously been
found guilty of the infraction at the same location or a different location.
The court shall have the power to enjoin a violator from further violations
of the same provisions upon penalty of contempt of court and such other
powers as may be specified in Iowa Code § 364.22 or this code of ordinances.



(2011 Code, § 13.0102)



      (3)   Responsible parties. The city can hold responsible the
deed holders, contract purchasers and the tenants of properties for the
property violations in this chapter. When a party initiates foreclosure
proceedings on a property, that action establishes an ownership interest in
the property that is sufficient to require that party to maintain the
property free of any nuisances and be obligated to abide by and be subject to
the provisions of this division (B).



(2011 Code, § 13.0103)



      (4)   Authority to issue citations. Citations for municipal
infractions may be issued by the City Administrator or the City
Administrator’s designee, Police Department, Fire Department, Public Works
Department, Community Development Department or the Water Board Manager on a
form approved by the City Administrator.



(2011 Code, § 13.0104)



      (5)   Service by citation. A citation issued pursuant to this
division (B) may be served pursuant to Iowa Code § 364.22.

   (F)   Employees.



      (1)   The Council shall authorize, by resolution, the number
and compensation of employees not otherwise provided by state law or the code

of $100,000 on a public improvement project, or to accept public improvements
and facilities upon their completion.

is absent, but does not include a seat where the Council member declines to
vote by reason of conflict of interest.

conflict of interest in a member of the Council, unless the vote of the
member of the Council was decisive to passage of the measure. The vote must
be computed on the basis of the number of members not disqualified by reason
of conflict of interest.



      (5)   However, a majority of all members is required for a
quorum. For the purpose of this section, the statement of a Council member
that the Council member declines to vote by reason of conflict of interest is
conclusive and must be entered of record.



   (B)   Over-riding Mayor’s veto. Within 30 days after the Mayor’s
veto, the Council may re-pass the ordinance or resolution by a vote of not
less than two-thirds of the Council members, and the ordinance or resolution
becomes effective upon re-passage and publication.



   (C)   Measures become effective. Measures passed by the Council,
other than motions, become effective in one of the following ways.



      (1)   If the Mayor signs the measure, a resolution becomes
effective immediately upon signing and an ordinance or amendment becomes a
law when published, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the
measure.



      (2)   If the Mayor vetoes a measure and the Council re-passes
the measure after the Mayor’s veto, a resolution becomes effective
immediately upon re-passage, and an ordinance or amendment becomes a law when
published, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the measure.



      (3)   If the Mayor takes no action on the measure a resolution
becomes effective 14 days after the date of passage and an ordinance or
amendment becomes law when published, but not sooner than 14 days after the
day of passage, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the
measure.

      (10)   Rebuttable presumption. There is a presumption that all
sanitary sewer customers within the district have prohibited discharge to the
sanitary sewer system. Effective three months after the establishment of the
district, all properties within the district that have not scheduled a city
inspection shall be presumed to have a prohibited discharge for the purpose
of this division (B). Effective the later of either 18 months after the
establishment of the district or six months after the date of the city
approved system plan, all properties within the district that have not
completed an approved removal procedure or other equivalent removal procedure
inspected and documented by the city shall be presumed to have a prohibited
discharge for purposes of this division (B).



      (11)   Non-compliance fee for prohibited discharge. Any
sanitary sewer customer within an established district who has not scheduled
a city inspection within three months after the establishment of the district
and any sanitary sewer customer within an established district with a direct
or indirect prohibited discharge to the sanitary sewer remaining in place the
later of either 18 months after the establishment of the district or six
months after the date of the city approved system plan, shall be subject to a
monthly fee of $65 for the extraneous flow, or potential extraneous flow,
contributed to the sanitary sewer system. The fee will be in addition to all
other sanitary sewer user charges. The later of either two years after the
establishment of the district or 12 months after the date of the
city-approved system plan, the sanitary sewer customer shall be subject to an
increased monthly non-compliance fee of $125.



      (12)   Refund of non-compliance fee. Any sanitary sewer
customer subject to the non-compliance fee under this chapter may request the
city to inspect the sanitary sewer service. If the city determines there was
no direct or indirect prohibited discharge as of the date of establishment of
the district, the city shall refund all non-compliance fee payments
collected. In the event the city determines prohibited discharge removal was
completed and the prohibited discharge no longer exists, the city shall
discontinue the imposition of the non-compliance fees for that sanitary sewer
customer and shall refund previous non-compliance fee payments. Such refund
shall be limited to the number of monthly payments made or three months,
whichever is less.



      (13)   Inspection and notice. If there is reason to believe
that a prohibited discharge is occurring, the city may, with reasonable
notice, conduct periodic inspection of properties to confirm there are no
direct or indirect prohibited discharges to the sanitary sewer system. If the
sanitary sewer customer fails to allow for an inspection within 30 days, the
property shall be subject to the non- compliance fee provisions under this
chapter. If during an inspection the city determines there is a direct or
indirect prohibited discharge as a result of a modification of the system to
allow for a direct or indirect prohibited discharge, failure to maintain or
replace a failed sump pump that would allow an indirect or direct connection
to the sanitary sewer system, or such other cause as may allow a direct or
indirect connection, the city shall provide the sanitary sewer customer a
written notice. The sanitary sewer customer shall be provided 30 days to cure
the defect and to arrange for a re-inspection by the city. If, at the end of
30 days, the direct or indirect connection has not been inspected and
determined to have been removed, the property shall be subject to the
non-compliance fee provisions under this chapter. The non-compliance fee
shall continue until such time as the city determines through inspection the
direct or indirect prohibited discharge no longer exists.



      (14)   Extension of deadlines. Due to unforeseen circumstances
that may be encountered during the program’s various stages, the following
extension of time will granted for the deadlines described in divisions
(B)(5), (B)(6), (B)(9) and (B)(10) above:



         (a)   An extension of time shall be granted for a change
in property ownership due to death of the owner(s) or foreclosure of the
property. In such cases, the new owner will have six months to be in
compliance upon taking ownership.



         (b)   The removal of prohibited discharges for property
in District #1 shall be completed by the later of either 6-1-2013 or six
months after the date of the city-approved system plan. The sanitary sewer
customer will be subject to the $50 monthly non-compliance fee for any direct
or indirect prohibited discharge remaining in place after the later of either
6-1-2013 or six months after the date of the city-approved system plan.

charge portion of the sewer user charge shall be computed by dividing
five-eighths or 62.5% of the annual debt service and other local capital
financing costs by the water usage and recorded by water meters and/or sewage
meters for wastes having normal domestic wastewater concentrations. In
addition, one-eighth or 12.5% of the annual debt service and other local
capital financing costs shall be divided by the number of connections to the
sewer system. These two portions shall be combined with the basic user
charge. The remaining one-fourth or 25% of the capital cost of the system
shall be raised through property taxation or any other legal means afforded
the city at the option of the City Council.



   (B)   Basic user charge.



      (1)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following

of 200 mg/l;



         (b)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/l; and



         (c)   An ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) content of 50 mg/l.



      (2)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs,
plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:



         (a)   Estimate wastewater characteristics by volume,
pounds of SS, pounds of BOD, pounds of NH3-N to be treated and customer bills
to be sent;



         (b)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to
operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund
for the year for all works categories;



         (c)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater
facility categories by volume, SS, BOD, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) and customer;



         (d)   Develop unit rates for volume, BOD, SS and NH3-N
by dividing estimated costs in division (B)(2)(c) above by estimated
wastewater characteristics in division (B)(2)(a) above;



         (e)   Compute costs per 100 cubic feet for normal
domestic wastewater; and



         (f)   Compute surcharge factor for multiplying time
costs per 100 cubic feet for BOD, SS and NH3-N in excess of normal domestic
wastewater.

SEWER CONNECTION FEE DISTRICTS




§ 52.090  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The city has determined the necessity of establishing a policy
and a procedure to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and
constructing major sanitary sewer facilities in those instances in which a
significant number of the properties to be benefitted by such facilities are
not sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Iowa Code Ch. 384, Div. IV. The
city hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein
provided, to recover the costs of designing and constructing such major
sanitary sewer facilities from property owners who connect to such facilities
subsequent to their construction.



   (B)   It is the intent of this subchapter to set forth the method of
recovery of proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect
their properties to major sanitary sewer facilities subsequent to their
construction, so that in the event that all property, other than street and
road right-of-way, which lies within the benefitted district is connected to
the major sanitary sewer facilities during their expected useful life, then
those properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100% of the cost of
designing and constructing such facilities, including legal, administrative
and interest expenses associated therewith.



(2011 Code, § 24.1000.1)



§ 52.091  NOTICE.



   (A)   In the event the City Council determines the necessity of
constructing a major sanitary sewer facility, and determines that the
utilization of a connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to
recover the city’s costs associated therewith, the City Council shall cause
a “notice of public hearing on the proposed adoption of an ordinance to
establish a benefitted district and a connection fee” to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the city as hereafter provided.



   (B)   In addition to indicating the date, time and place of the
public hearing, the notice shall:



      (1)   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary
sewer facility or facilities under consideration for construction, as well as
the estimated cost or costs for the design and construction of same;



      (2)   Identify by general description the proposed benefitted
district to be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities; and



      (3)   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be
paid by property owners within the benefitted district who connect to said
facilities, expressed in dollars per single-family equivalent for each type
of use of land area served.



   (C)   The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee
ordinance is on file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both
are available for public inspection in the office of the City Clerk. Notice
and public hearing shall be pursuant to the method set forth in the first
sentence of Iowa Code § 384.38(3) (1999), referring to Iowa Code § 362.3.
As a courtesy, a copy of the information contained in the notice shall be
mailed by regular mail to each property owner within the benefitted district
as shown by the records of the County Auditor.

§ 90.52  DETERMINATION OF PROBLEMATIC DOGS.



   (A)   After an investigation, the Police Chief or his or her
designee is authorized to make a determination whether a dog is problematic
based on the factors listed in § 90.51 of this chapter and shall notify the
owner of the dog in writing by certified mail or hand delivery with signature
of that status.



   (B)   Following attempted notice to the owner if the Police Chief or
his or her designee has probable cause to believe that a dog is a problematic
dog and may pose a threat to public safety, the Police Department may, by
owner consent or warrant, impound the dog pending disposition of the case or
until the dog owner has fulfilled the requirements hereof. The owner of the
dog will be liable for the costs of impounding and keeping the dog.



   (C)   The owner may request a hearing before a review committee by
sending a written notice to the City Clerk within 15 days after the date of
notice from the city of the determination of a problematic dog. Upon receipt
of a request for hearing, the review committee shall schedule a hearing
concerning the determination of a problematic dog to be held within 30 days
after receipt by the city of the request for hearing. The determination
regarding a problematic dog shall be stayed pending the results of the
hearing.



   (D)   If the owner timely requests a hearing before the review
committee pursuant to § 90.52(C), such hearing shall follow the following

problematic. At the hearing, the Chief of Police or his or her designee may
call witnesses, cross examine witnesses, present evidence, and examine
evidence.



      (3)   All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded.
The hearing officer shall hear testimony from the animal control officer, the
owner of the dog, and any witnesses for either side. Formal rules of evidence

govern the proceedings.



      (4)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of
law, and shall issue an order classifying a dog as problematic, or an order
stating that there's insufficient cause to declare the dog as problematic. A

or until the dog owner has fulfilled the requirements of § 90.55 of this
chapter.



      (2)   The owner of the dog will be liable for the costs of

subsequent behavior.



         (e)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit a hearing
officer from taking a case under advisement or continuing a hearing in the
interest of justice.



      (3)   In the event that the vicious dog determination has been
in place for 12 months or more,



and provided there have been no further violations of the provisions of this
chapter during such time, the owner may make application to the review
committee to have the vicious dog designation or any requirements contained
therein rescinded or amended. The owner shall make such application by
providing a written request for hearing to the City Clerk. This request must
state the full name of the applicant, the subject dog, and must contain a
certification that no further violations of this chapter have occurred in the
12-month period immediately preceding such application. Within 20 days of
receipt of the application, the City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing
before the review committee, which hearing shall occur no later than 45 days
after the date the application was filed with the City Clerk. In rendering
its decision, the review committee may consider, among other items, the
severity of the incident that resulted in the designation, the need to
protect the public from further incidents, and the likelihood of future
incidents based on the history of the owner and/or the subject dog. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the review committee may rescind the vicious dog
designation, may rescind or amend specific requirements set forth in the
designation, or may take no action. The original vicious dog determination
shall remain in effect pending the results of the hearing. In the event the

any requirements contained therein, the owner may not request another hearing
before the review committee for another 12 months from the date of the review
committee's decision, unless the review committee in rendering its decision
shall specifically provide for a subsequent review within a shorter period of
time.

§ 90.54  EXCEPTIONS; CONSEQUENCES OF DETERMINATIONS.



   (A)   No dog shall be declared a vicious dog or a problematic dog if
the dog threatened, injured, or damaged a person or domestic animal because
it was provoked by that person or animal. For purposes of this section, any
attack by an animal or physical injury caused by an animal shall be
considered provoked if at the time the attack occurs or the injury is
inflicted: (1) the person or animal who was attacked or injured was teasing,
tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal; (2) the animal was protecting
a person, itself, its young, or another domestic animal from an attack by a
human being or another animal; or (3) the person who was attacked or injured
was committing a crime on the property or was attempting to commit a crime or
violating or attempting to violate a statute or ordinance which protects
person or property of the animals responsible party or (4) the animal was
being utilized by a law enforcement agency for law enforcement purposes while
under the control and direction of a law enforcement officer.



   (B)   (1)   If the Police Chief or his or her designee determines
that a dog is a problematic dog under § 90.52 of this chapter, the owner
shall comply with the provisions of § 90.55 of this chapter and any other
special security or care requirements which are reasonable.



      (2)   The Police Chief or his or her designee may cause a dog
to be quarantined for observation for a minimum period of no less than ten
days when any such dog has bitten a domesticated animal or caused a skin
abrasion upon any person. If said dog has a current rabies certificate, then
such quarantine may be at the discretion of the person or persons in charge
of animal enforcement and the quarantine occurs on the owner’s premises in
a manner ordered and as directed. If the owner fails to confine the dog as
directed, then it shall be apprehended and held for the remainder of the
ten-day quarantine at a veterinarian’s office. If said dog has not been
vaccinated against the rabies virus or the rabies vaccination has since
expired then said dog will be quarantined at a veterinarian’s office for no
less the ten days. If a dog is placed in quarantine outside of the home, the
owner shall be required to pay the impounding fees. If the owner fails to pay
the fees at the end of the period of isolation as directed by the animal
enforcement authority, the animal will be turned over to the local animal
shelter for assessment of adoptability. If said animal is deemed unadoptable
it will be humanely euthanized. If a dog has bitten a domesticated animal or
a person or caused a skin abrasion upon a person and is unclaimed or the
owner is unknown, then it shall be held for a quarantine time of no less than
ten days and then may be humanely euthanized.



      (3)   If the Police Chief or his or her designee determines
that a dog is a vicious dog under § 90.53 of this chapter, the owner shall
comply with the provisions of § 90.55 of this chapter and any other special
security or care requirements which are reasonable.



      (4)   The Police Chief or his or her designee may require
immediate impoundment of the dog if the owner is unable or unwilling to
comply with the requirements of § 90.55 of this chapter until the owner of
the dog has satisfied all the requirements of the certificate of
registration. The requirements must be met within 30 days. If, after 30 days,
the owner has not satisfied all the requirements of the certificate of
registration, the dog may be humanely euthanized on the thirty-first day. The
owner of the problematic/vicious dog shall be liable to the organization
designated to hold said dog for all costs incurred while housing whether or
not the dog is reclaimed by the owner.



      (5)   If the occurrence results in the death of a person, the
dog shall be euthanized.

      (1)   The owner of the problematic dog is 18 years of age or
older;



      (2)   The owner of the problematic dog shall present a
certificate of insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to do
business in the state, providing personal liability insurance coverage as in
a homeowner’s policy, with a minimum liability amount of $50,000 for the
injury or death of any person, for damage to property of others and for acts
of negligence by the owner or his or her agents. The certificate shall
require notice to the city, in conformity with general city standards for
certificates of insurance, if the underlying policy of insurance is cancelled
for any reason. In lieu of such a certificate, a copy of a current
homeowner’s policy designating these requirements shall be sufficient proof
of insurance for purposes of this division (A)(2). If a certificate of
insurance or policy is not immediately available, a binder indicating the
coverage may be accepted for up to 30 days subsequent to the determination
that a dog is problematic; however, if after 30 days a certificate of
insurance or a policy has not been submitted, the dog shall be deemed
unlicensed and subject to immediate impoundment or humane euthanasia at the
owner’s expense;



      (3)   A valid license has been issued for the problematic dog
at the owner’s expense pursuant to jurisdiction;



      (4)   The problematic dog has a current rabies vaccination at
the owner’s expense;



      (5)   The owner has a proper enclosure to prevent the entry of
any person or animal and the escape of said problematic dog, as described in
§ 90.51 of this chapter;



      (6)   The problematic dog has been spayed or neutered at the
owner’s expense;



      (7)   The problematic dog has been implanted with a microchip
containing owner identification information at the owner’s expense. The
microchip information must be registered with the law enforcement, the animal
authority, the animal control authority or his or her designee of the
jurisdiction; and



      (8)   The problematic dog has been photographed for
identification purposes.



   (B)   The Police Department shall issue a certificate of
registration to the owner of a vicious dog if the owner, in addition to
satisfying the requirements for registration of a problematic dog pursuant to
division (A) above, establishes to the satisfaction of the Police Chief or
his or her designee that:



      (1)   The owner will maintain the vicious dog exclusively on
the owner’s property, except for medical treatment or examination; and



      (2)   The owner of the vicious dog has posted on the premises
a clearly visible “Beware of Dog” warning sign indicating there is a
vicious dog on the property. The sign shall be very visible from the public
roadway or 50 feet, whichever is less.



   (C)   The Police Chief or his or her designee may order the
immediate impoundment of a vicious dog if the owner fails to abide by the
conditions for registration or confinement or handling of a vicious or
problematic dog.



   (D)   If any dog previously determined to be a problematic dog has
not exhibited any of the behaviors specified in § 90.51 of this chapter
within 12 months since the date of the problematic dog determination, then
that dog is eligible for a review of the determination with the potential for
lifting the requirements of this section. Annual reviews shall be completed
by the Police Chief upon application of the owner, which application shall be
made to the City Clerk. The Police Chief may rescind the problematic dog
designation, may rescind or amend specific requirements set forth in the
designation, or may take no action.



   (E)   If an owner applies for an annual review to the Police Chief
and the owner is aggrieved by the Police Chief's decision, the owner may make
application to the review committee to have the problematic dog designation
or any requirements contained therein rescinded or amended. The owner shall
make such application by providing a written request for hearing to the City
Clerk. The application must be submitted within 15 days from the date of the
Police Chief’s decision to continue the problematic dog determination, must
set forth the full name of the applicant and the subject dog, and must
contain a certification that no further violations of this chapter have
occurred in the 12-month period immediately preceding such application.
Within 20 days of receipt of the Application, the City Clerk shall set the
matter for hearing before the review committee, which hearing shall occur no
later than 45 days after the date the application was filed with the City
Clerk. In rendering its decision, the review committee may consider, among
other items, the severity of the incident that resulted in the designation,
the need to protect the public from further incidents, the likelihood of
future incidents based on the history of the owner and/or the subject dog. At
the conclusion of the hearing, the review committee may rescind the
problematic dog designation, may rescind or amend specific requirements set
forth in the designation, or may take no action. The original problematic dog
determination shall remain in effect pending the results of the hearing. In
the event the review committee declines to rescind or amend the problematic
dog designation or any requirements contained therein, the owner may not
request another hearing before the review committee for another 12 months
from the date of the review committee's decision, unless the review committee
in rendering its decision shall specifically provide for a subsequent review
within a shorter period of time.

nuisance exists, the officer shall cause to be served upon the property owner
a written notice to abate the nuisance within a reasonable time after notice.



      (2)   With regard to the nuisance involving real property,
property owners will be notified after the first determination that
conditions exist posing a nuisance and that a second determination of this
kind will immediately constitute the failure to abate a nuisance as outlined
in this section, which subjects the property owner to all applicable fines.



   (B)   Notice to abate. The notice to abate shall contain:



      (1)   Description of nuisance. A description of what
constitutes the nuisance or other condition;



      (2)   Location of nuisance. The location of the nuisance or
condition;



      (3)   Acts necessary to abate. A statement of the act or acts
necessary to abate the nuisance or condition;

complete the abatement; and



      (5)   Assessment of city costs. A statement that if the
nuisance or condition is not abated as directed and no request for hearing is
made within the time prescribed, the city will abate it and assess the costs
against the property owner.



   (C)   Method of service. The notice may be in the form of an
ordinance or sent by certified mail to the property owner.



   (D)   Request for hearing. Any person ordered to abate a nuisance
may have a hearing with the City Administrator as to whether a nuisance
exists. A request for a hearing must be made in writing and delivered to the
Clerk within the time stated in the notice, or it will be conclusively
presumed that a nuisance exists and it must be abated as ordered. The hearing
will be before the City Administrator at a time and place fixed by the City
Administrator. The findings of the City Administrator shall be conclusive
and, if a nuisance is found to exist, it shall be ordered abated within a
reasonable time under the circumstances.



   (E)   Abatement in emergency. If it is determined that an emergency
exists by reason of the continuing maintenance of the nuisance or condition,
the city may perform any action which may be required under this chapter
without prior notice. The city shall assess the costs as provided in this
section after notice to the property owner and hearing under the applicable
provisions of this section.



   (F)   Abatement by city. If the person notified to abate a nuisance
or condition neglects or fails to abate as directed, the city may perform the
required action to abate, keeping an accurate account of the expense
incurred. The itemized expense account shall be filed with the Clerk, who
shall pay such expenses on behalf of the city.



   (G)   Collection of costs. The Clerk shall send a statement of the
total expense incurred, by certified mail, to the property owner who has
failed to abide by the notice to abate; and, if the amount shown by the
statement has not been paid within 30 days after the statement was sent, the
Clerk shall certify the costs to the County Treasurer and such costs shall
then be collected with, and in the same manner as, general property taxes.



   (H)   Installment payment of cost of abatement. If the amount
expended to abate the nuisance or condition exceeds $100, the city may permit

bronze combination veteran’s grave marker and flag holder which can be
readily removed while mowing or caring for the lot. No double marker of any
kind or additional marker shall be permitted for any single burial lot.



   (E)   Objects on lot. No other markers, shrubs, trees, plants other
than annual plants or cut flowers, urns or other objects of any kind, except
the corner markers placed on the lots by cemetery personnel and small vases
for temporary display of cut flowers, shall be permitted at any time. All cut
flowers and containers, if any, shall be removed as soon as such flowers
wither or fade.



   (F)   Consent to be bound by rules and regulations. The burial of
any person in the veteran’s plot, or the reservation or purchase of any lot
therein, shall constitute a consent by all persons concerned to be bound by
and an agreement to abide by these rules and regulations.



   (G)   Applicability of general cemetery rules and regulations. The
rules and regulations contained in this section are supplementary to the
rules and regulations governing city cemeteries generally and are not
intended to abrogate or impair restrictions and regulations imposed by such
regulations which are applicable to the entire Newton Union Cemetery, except
insofar as such general rules and regulations would permit anything
prohibited by these rules for the veteran’s plot.

SERVICE CHARGE FOR FALSE ALARMS




§ 96.01  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish a service charge for
owners/subscribers of alarm systems directly connected to the County
Communications Center or the City Police Department which cause an excessive
occurrence of false alarms responded to by the City Police Department. The
subchapter also provides the power to the Chief of Police to order “no
response” to owner/subscribers of alarm systems for non-payment of service
charges.



(2011 Code, § 1.0607.1)



§ 96.02  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   ALARM END USER. The person, firm, corporation or entity of any kind of
control of any building, structure or facility who purchases, leases,
contracts for or otherwise obtains an alarm system.



   ALARM SYSTEM. A method of detecting and signaling the presence, entry
or attempted entry or holdup into or on a protected premise. The term does
not mean audible alarms from automobiles.



   FALSE ALARM. Any signal, directly or indirectly from an alarm system,
eliciting an urgent response by police when a situation requiring an urgent
response does not, in fact, exist. The term does not include an alarm signal
caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances
not reasonably subject to control by the alarm end user. The burden of
proving that such alarm was not a FALSE ALARM shall be on the alarm end user.



(2011 Code, § 1.0607.2)



§ 96.03  SERVICE CHARGE ESTABLISHED.



   Upon receipt of a false alarm, whether the false alarm is intentional
or unintentional, and a police response is requested by the activation of
said alarm system, the alarm user will be notified by the Police Department
of the occurrence of the alarm and a verbal warning will be issued.



   (A)   Upon the seventh false alarm occurrence within any calendar
year, whether the alarm was intentional or unintentional, and a police
response is requested by the activation of said alarm system, the alarm end
user will be notified in writing by the Police Department that each future
false alarm will be cause for imposition of a service fee as set by City
Council resolution.



   (B)   Upon the eighth through the fifteenth false alarm occurrence
within any calendar year, whether the false alarm was intentional or
unintentional, and a police response is requested by the activation of said
alarm system, the alarm end user will be charged a service fee as set by City
Council resolution for each occurrence due to owner/employee error or
negligence.



   (C)   Upon the sixteenth and all subsequent false alarm occurrences
within any calendar year, whether the alarm was intentional or unintentional,
and a police response is requested by the activation of said alarm system,
the alarm end user will be charged a service fee as set by City Council
resolution for each occurrence due to employee error or negligence.



   (D)   Alarm malfunction by other than owner/employee error or
negligence shall not be counted as a false alarm for purpose of levying a
service charge.



(2011 Code, § 1.0607.3)



§ 96.04  APPEAL.



   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Chief of Police with
reference to a service charge or “no response” shall have the right to
appeal the decision to the City Administrator. An appeal must be made within
ten days after notice by the Chief of Police by filing with the City
Administrator a letter of appeal stating the basis for the appeal. Failure to
file a written appeal within ten days shall constitute a waiver of appellants
right to have the decision reviewed. The City Administrator may either
affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Chief of Police. The appellant
will receive notice in writing within ten days of the City Administrator’s
decision. The decision of City Administrator is final.

FRANCHISING AUTHORITY; REGULATIONS




§ 116.040  FRANCHISE FEE.



   (A)   Franchise fee payment. In consideration for the use of the
streets and public ways of the city for the construction, operation,
maintenance and reconstruction of a cable system within the city, a grantee
shall pay to the grantor an annual amount equal to 5% of the grantee’s
gross revenues, as defined in § 116.002 of this chapter.



   (B)   Quarterly payments. Payment due to the grantor under the
franchise agreement shall be made quarterly at the City Clerk’s office not
later than 45 days following March 31, June 30, September 20 and December 31
of each year. Any fee not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate of 1.5%
per month from the date due. Each payment shall be accompanied with a
detailed report, (as shown in Exhibit C of the ordinance codified herein),
showing the basis for the computation, and shall include, but not be limited
to, a specific breakdown of the following items: basic tier service charges;
expanded basic service charges; installation charges; reconnection fees;
premium channel revenues; shopping service revenue; revenue from other
sources such as contracted or subleased cable services; pay per view;
miscellaneous revenue; and such other relevant facts as may be required by
the grantor necessary to determine the accuracy of the franchise payment as
specified in of this chapter. The acceptance of any payment shall not be
construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount
nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim
the grantor may have for additional sums payable by the grantee. The grantee
agrees to permit the city, upon request with reasonable notice, to review at
the grantee’s local office its gross revenue records as may be necessary to
monitor compliance with this section. All amounts paid shall be subject to
audit and recomputation by the grantor.



   (C)   Franchise fee audit. A grantee will fully cooperate with a
franchise fee audit performed by a professional firm that is chosen by the
grantor. The costs associated with the audit will be paid for by the grantor;
except that, the grantee shall pay for the costs if the audit shows an
underpayment of franchise fees in excess of 5% or more for a reporting period.



   (D)   Franchise fee increases. The grantor may request an increase
in franchise fees at any time during the term of the franchise, equal to the
maximum percentage allowed by federal law. However, such request shall be
made in writing and the grantee will not be liable for said increase until
proper notice, as defined by federal law, is given to its subscriber. Prior
to making a final decision regarding an increase in franchise fees, the
grantor shall conduct a public hearing and shall grant an opportunity to the
grantee to discuss the proposed increase in franchise fee.



   (E)   Limitation on franchise fee actions. The period of limitation
for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from
the date on which payment by a grantee is due.

§ 116.042  FRANCHISE RENEWAL.



   Any proceedings undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to
the renewal of a grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with
the provisions of § 626 of the Cable Act, as amended, being 47 USC 521 et
seq., unless the procedures and substantive protections set forth therein
shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any
subsequent provision of federal or state law.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.3)



§ 116.043  CONDITIONS OF SALE.



   (A)   If a renewal or extension of a grantee’s franchise is denied
or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority either
lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully
effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any
such acquisition or transfer shall be at a price determined pursuant to the
provisions set forth in § 627 of the Cable Act, being 47 USC 521 et seq.



   (B)   In the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of
the franchise, at the grantee’s request, which shall be made in its sole
discretion, the grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate
a transfer of its system to a qualified third party. During such a period,
the franchise authority shall authorize the grantee to continue to operate
pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise. However, in no event shall such
authorization exceed a period of time greater than six months from the
effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the grantee
is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its system
which his or her reasonably acceptable to the franchise authority, the
grantee and the franchising authority may avail themselves of any rights they
may have pursuant to federal or state law. The grantee may continue to
operate of its system during the six-month period and it shall not be deemed
to be a waiver or extinguishment of any right of either the franchising
authority or the grantee.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.4)



§ 116.044  TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.



   (A)   Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be a privilege
to be held for the benefit of the public. Any franchise so granted cannot, in
any event, be sold transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including,
but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, except to entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the grantee, without
the prior written consent of the franchising authority. Such consent as
required by the franchising authority, shall be given or denied no later than
120 days following any request and shall not be unreasonably withheld. Prior
consent shall not be required when transferring the franchise between
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same entity. Nor shall such consent be
required for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation or
assignment of any rights, title or interest of the grantee in the cable
system in order to secure indebtedness.



   (B)   In the event that the grantee sells or otherwise transfers
ownership in the cable system, such sale or transfer shall conform with §
617 of the Cable Act, being 47 USC 521 et seq. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control,
the franchising authority may, in accordance with § 617, inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the franchising authority in any such inquiry. In seeking the
grantor’s consent to any change in ownership or control, the transferee
shall have the responsibility:



      (1)   To show to the satisfaction of the franchising authority
whether the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee (the proposed
transferee), which in the case of a corporation, shall include all directors
and all persons having a legal or equitable interest of 50% or more of the
voting stock:



         (a)   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts
involving moral turpitude including, but not limited to, any violation of
federal, state or local law or regulations, or is presently under an
indictment, investigation or complaint charging such acts;



         (b)   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud,
deceit or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him or them by any court
of competent jurisdiction; or



         (c)   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or
administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system. The
franchising authority retains the right to withhold approval of the transfer
until the transferee has provided the information required in this division
(B)(1).



      (2)   To establish the financial solvency of the proposed
transferee by submitting all current financial data for the proposed
transferee and such other data to determine the legal, financial, and
technical qualification of the transferee; and



      (3)   To establish that the technical capability of the
proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain and operate the
cable system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing
franchise terms.



   (C)   (1)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction
and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the
franchising authority that the financial institution, or its designee, as
approved in writing by the franchising authority, shall take control and
operate the cable system in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the cable system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
franchising authority at its discretion; but, during said period of time, it
shall have the right to petition the franchising authority to transfer the
franchise to another grantee.



      (2)   Except insofar as the enforceability of this division
(C) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and further
subject to applicable federal, state or local law, if the franchising
authority finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial,
character, technical and other public interest qualities of the proposed
transferee, is satisfactory, the franchising authority shall transfer and
assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.



   (D)   The consent or approval of the franchising authority to any
transfer by the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the
rights of the franchising authority in and to the public right-of-way and any
lawful governmental right or power of the grantor, and any transfer shall by
its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise.



   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the
franchise agreement.



   (F)   The franchising authority may approve the transfer or deny the
transfer pursuant to § 617 of the Cable Act, being 47 USC 521 et seq.



   (G)   When the grantor approves a transfer under this section, the
new grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in §
116.026 of this chapter, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds,
proofs of insurance and certifications.



   (H)   The restrictions of this section shall be effective
immediately upon execution of a franchise agreement.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.5)



§ 116.045  RIGHT OF INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION.



   The grantor shall have the right to visually inspect all construction
or installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and
to make such visual inspections as it shall find necessary to ensure
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other pertinent provision of
law.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.6)



§ 116.046  NEW DEVELOPMENTS.



   The grantee is encouraged to upgrade its facilities, equipment, and
service so that its cable system is advanced. New developments shall be a
topic of discussion at all review sessions and shall be a factor to be
considered in connection with requests for rate adjustments, pursuant to FCC
rules and regulations.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.7)



§ 116.047  CITY’S RIGHT TO PURCHASE SYSTEM.



   The city shall be entitled to a right of first refusal of any bona fide
offer to purchase the cable system made to grantee if the cable system is
being sold separately and such sale is not linked in any way to the sale of
any other cable system in a separate franchise area. BONA FIDE OFFER, as used
in this section, means a written offer, which has been accepted by the
grantee subject to the city’s rights under this chapter. The city shall
notify the grantee of its interest in purchasing the cable system within 30
days of the city’s receipt from the grantee of copy of the written bona
fide offer. Payment shall be made upon closing in readily available funds
within 120 days of the city’s receipt from the grantee of a copy of the
written bona fide offer. The price to be paid by the city shall be the fair
market value of the cable system or the actual price, which has been
negotiated at arms length between the parties, whichever is greater the
amount offered in the bona fide offer.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 5.8)




ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT




§ 116.060  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.



   In the event that the franchising authority believes that the grantee
has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the grantee
in writing of the exact nature of the alleged non-compliance.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.1)



§ 116.061  GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.



   The grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in
§ 116.060 of this chapter:



   (A)   To respond to the franchising authority, contesting the
assertion of non-compliance;



   (B)   To cure such default; or



   (C)   In the event that, by the nature of default, such default
cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy
such default and notify the franchising authority of the steps being taken
and the projected date that they will be completed.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.2)



§ 116.062  PUBLIC HEARING.



   In the event that the grantee fails to respond to the notice described
in § 116.060 of this chapter, pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
116.061 of this chapter, or in the event that the alleged default is not
remedied within 30 days or the date projected pursuant to § 116.061 of this
chapter, the franchising authority shall schedule a public hearing to
investigate the default. The franchising authority shall notify the grantee
in writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five business
days in advance and provide the grantee with an opportunity to be heard.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.3)



§ 116.063  ENFORCEMENT GENERALLY.



   (A)   Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the
franchising authority, after such public hearing, determines that the grantee
is in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising authority
may:



      (1)   Seek specific performance of any provision, which
reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;



      (2)   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek
other equitable relief; or



      (3)   In the case of a substantial default of a material
provision of the franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked in
accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.



   (B)   The franchising authority shall give written notice to the
grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of non-compliance
by the grantee, including one or more instance of substantial non-compliance
with a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the
exact nature of the non-compliance. The grantee shall have 90 days from such
notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In
the event the franchising authority has not received a response satisfactory
from the grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public
meeting. The franchising authority shall cause to be served upon the grantee,
at least ten days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying
the tie and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such
termination.



   (C)   (1)   At the designated meeting, the franchising authority
shall give the grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter,
after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked.
The grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which
shall have the power to review the decision of the franchising authority
“de novo” and to modify or reverse such decision as justice may require.



      (2)   Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken
within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the franchising
authority.



   (D)   The franchising authority may, at it sole discretion, take any
lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the franchising
authority’s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the
franchise.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.4)



§ 116.064  PROMPT COMPLIANCE.



   The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with this
chapter by reason of the grantor’s failure to enforce prompt compliance.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.5)



§ 116.065  IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE.



   (A)   A grantee shall not be held in default under or in
non-compliance with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any
enforcement or penalty relating to non-compliance or default (including
termination, cancellation or revocation of the franchise), where such
non-compliance or alleged defaults are caused by circumstances reasonably
beyond its control including, but not limited, to strike, riot, war
earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storms,
hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic acts of nature, labor disputes,
governmental, administrative or judicial or regulation.



   (B)   This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for
utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the
grantee’s cable and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of
materials and/or labor to perform the work necessary.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.6)



§ 116.066  TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.



   (A)   Grounds for revocation. The grantor reserves the right to
revoke any franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated with
the franchise in the following circumstances:



      (1)   If the grantee should default in the performance of any
of its material obligations under this ordinance or the franchise and fails
to cure the default within 60 days after receipt of written notice of the
default from the grantor, or such longer time as specified by the grantor;



      (2)   If a petition is filed by or against the grantee under
the Bankruptcy Act or any other insolvency or creditors’ rights law, state
or federal, and the grantee shall fail to have it dismissed;



      (3)   If a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the grantee is
applied for or appointed for all or part of the grantee’s assets;



      (4)   If the grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of
creditors;



      (5)   If the grantee violates any order or ruling of any state
or federal regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee, unless the
grantee or any party similarly affected is lawfully contesting the legality
or applicability of such order or ruling and has received a stay from a court
of appropriate jurisdiction;



      (6)   If the grantee evades any of the provisions of this
chapter or the franchise agreement;



      (7)   If the grantee practices any intentional fraud or deceit
upon the grantor or cable subscribers;



      (8)   If the grantee materially misrepresents facts in the
application for a franchise; and



      (9)   If the grantee ceases to provide services over the cable
system for seven consecutive days for any reason within the control of the
grantee.



   (B)   Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill at its own expense any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee’s removal of its
equipment and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables,
wires or attachments. The grantor shall inspect and approve the condition of
the public ways and public places and cables, wire, attachments and poles
after removal. Liability insurance indemnity provided in § 116.156 of this
chapter and the performance bond in § 116.068 of this chapter shall continue
in full force and effect during the period of removal.



   (C)   Reimbursement of costs pursuant to divisions (A) and (B)
above. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work as
required by law or ordinance within the time established and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the grantor, after due notice and opportunity to
curve, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall
reimburse the grantor the costs thereof within 30 days after receipt of an
itemized list of such costs or the grantor may recover such costs as provided
in § 116.067 of this chapter.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.7)



§ 116.067  SECURITY FUND.



   (A)   Within ten days after execution of the franchise agreement, a
grantee shall deposit with the City Clerk, and maintain, on deposit through
the term of the franchise, the sum of $10,000 as security for the faithful
performance by it of all the provisions of the franchise and compliance with
all orders, permits and directions of any agency of the grantor having
jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the franchise, and the payment
by a grantee of any claims, liens and taxes due the grantor which arise by
reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.



   (B)   Within ten days after notice that any amount has been
withdrawn from the security fund deposited pursuant to division (A) above, a
grantee shall pay to, or deposit with, the City Clerk a sum of money
sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount of $10,000.



   (C)   (1)   If a grantee fails to pay to the grantor any
compensation within the time fixed herein; or fails after ten days’ notice
to pay to the grantor any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay to the
grantor within such ten days, any damages, costs or expenses which the
grantor shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of a
grantee in connection with the franchise; or fails after three days’ notice
of such failure by the grantor to comply with any provision of the franchise
which the grantor reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of
the security, the City Clerk may immediately withdraw the amount thereof,
with interest and any penalties, from the security fund.



      (2)   Upon such withdrawal, the City Clerk shall notify a
grantee of the amount and date thereof.



   (D)   (1)   The security fund deposited shall become the property
of the grantor in the event that the franchise is canceled by reason of the
default of the grantee.



      (2)   A grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of
such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the
expiration of the term of the franchise; provided that, there is then no
outstanding default on the part of a grantee.



      (3)   Interest earned by the investment of the security fund
will accrue to a grantee.



   (E)   The rights reserved to the grantor with the respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the grantor; whether
reserved by the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other
right the grantor may have.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.8)



§ 116.068  FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE BOND.



   Upon acceptance of a franchise, a grantee shall submit and maintain
throughout the term of the franchise a faithful performance bond in the
amount of $100,000. The bond shall insure compliance with all applicable
laws, regulations, ordinances and provisions of the franchise and this
chapter, shall provide for recoverable loss or damages, compensation,
indemnification, reasonable attorney fees, cost of removal or abandonment of
the grantee’s property and shall cover penalties for failure to meet the
construction requirements, as may be outlined in the franchise agreement.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 8.9)




STANDARDS OF SERVICE




§ 116.080  GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.

subject to the provisions of the franchise agreement.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 3.1)



§ 116.081  STREET OCCUPANCY CONDITIONS.



   All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines and
equipment installed or erected by the grantee pursuant to the terms hereof
shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use
of public ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property
owners who own property that adjoins any of such public ways. A grantee shall
first obtain a permit from the grantor prior to commencing construction on
the streets, alleys, public grounds or places and shall be on a form provided
by the grantor. A grantee shall not open or disturb the surface of any
street, sidewalk, driveway or public place for any purpose without having
first obtained a permit to do so in the manner provided by ordinance. All
excavation shall be coordinated with other utility excavation or construction
so as to minimize disruption to the public.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 3.2)



§ 116.082  PUBLIC WAY RESTORATION.



   If, during the course of the grantee’s construction, operation or
maintenance of the cable system, there occurs a disturbance of any public way
by the grantee, it shall, at its expense, replace and restore such public way
to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way
existing immediately prior to such disturbance, consistent with the
grantor’s permitting process and applicable law.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 3.3)



§ 116.083  RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF FRANCHISING AUTHORITY.



   Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than ten
business days, the grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate in the public way or remove from the public
way, any property of the grantee when lawfully required by the franchising
authority by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment,
freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade,
installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of
structures or improvements by the franchising authority; but, the grantee
shall, in all cases, have the right of abandonment of its property. If public
funds are available to any person using such street, easement or right-of-way
for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the
franchising authority shall provide notice to the grantee of the grantor’s
application for such funds and shall allow the grantee to apply on its own
behalf for such funds.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 3.4)



§ 116.084  SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.



   Construction, installation and maintenance of the system shall be
performed in an orderly and worker like manner. All such work shall be
performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other federal,
state and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code. The cable
system shall not unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of
persons or property in the service area.



(2011 Code, Ch. 43, Art. 5, § 3.5)



§ 116.085  UNDERGROUND, OVERGROUND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Pole agreements. The grantee may lease, rent or in any other
manner by mutual agreement obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables and
other equipment and facilities from utility companies operating within the
city, and use towers, poles, lines, cables and other equipment and facilities
for the system. When and where practicable, the poles used by the grantee’s
distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by such utility
companies operating with the city; provided, mutually satisfactory rental
agreements can be reached. It is the grantor’s desire that all holders of
public franchises in the city cooperate with the grantee and allow the
grantee the use of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so
that the number of new or additional poles installed in the city may be
minimized.



   (B)   Grantee’s poles. The grantee shall have the right to erect,
install and maintain its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground
conduits and manholes as may be necessary for the proper construction and
maintenance of the antenna site, headend and the distribution system;
providing that, the grantee has at the worksite the necessary grantor
permit(s) or copy thereof, for scheduled work, obtained in advance from the
appropriate department of the grantor.



   (C)   Rent of grantee’s poles. A grantee shall have the right to
establish terms, conditions and specifications governing the form, type,
size, quantity and location of equipment of others on its poles, and shall
the further right to charge a fair rental for attachment space or spaces
occupied by the said equipment and plant of others; except that, no rent
shall be paid by the grantor for its attachment to the grantee’s poles and
such use shall be non-commercial and may not be supplied for any municipal
use directly competing with the grantee. The grantor shall pay any costs
incurred by a grantee in providing space for a grantor’s attachments,
including any necessary rearrangements of a grantee’s equipment and plant
to provide room for grantor’s attachments. Upon expiration, termination or
revocation of a franchise, or should a grantee wish to dispose of any of its
poles, conduit or manholes, being used by the grantor, the grantor shall have
the option to purchase them in place for their fair market value.



   (D)   Underground facilities. In those areas of the city where
transmission or distribution facilities of both telephone and power companies
are underground or hereafter may be placed underground, the grantee shall
likewise construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground to the maximum extent the then existing
technology permits, in accordance with the most recent National Electrical
Code, and its successor document, as well as in conformance with all
applicable state and municipal ordinances and codes. If and when necessary,
amplifiers and/or transformers in the grantee’s transmission and
distribution lines shall be in appropriate housings on the surface of the
ground. The grantee shall obtain a permit from the grantor for such
underground construction of all work required or pursuant to this section.
Even when not required, underground installation is preferable to the placing
of additional poles.



   (E)   Compliance to codes.



      (1)   All transmission and distribution structures, lines and
equipment erected by the grantee in the city shall be located so as not to

§ 117.01  PURPOSE.



   State of Iowa licensed massage therapists and businesses offering
massage therapy services perform an important service in addressing the
health and wellbeing of our citizens. Unfortunately, there are businesses
that advertise they provide massage therapy and/or other therapeutic
services, but they are engaged in various illegal activities which may
include prostitution and/or human trafficking. This chapter is not intended
to discourage a legitimately licensed massage therapist or massage therapy
business from providing their services in the city of Newton. The purpose of
this ordinance is to identify and address businesses that engage in the
practice of massage therapy without a license and/or are involved in illegal
activities which may include prostitution and/or human trafficking.
Businesses providing massage therapy yet conducting various types of illegal
activity are harmful to the city and the image of the massage therapy
profession. The implementation of this ordinance will better enable the city
to proactively screen, monitor and remove businesses that are engaged in
illegal activity.

§ 132.01  PURPOSE.

the city and specifically to achieve the following purposes:

   (B)   Protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed
individually and in groups after the curfew hour; and



   (C)   Protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity
by individuals and groups that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.



(2011 Code, § 11.0351.1)



§ 132.02  DEFINITIONS.

in the public place. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth
certificate or driver’s license, a police officer on the street shall, in
the first instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age. The
officer shall not issue a citation or take a minor into custody under this
section unless the officer  reasonably believes that an offense has occurred
and that, based on the minor’s response and other circumstances, no defense
in § 132.04 of this chapter is present.



   (B)   A peace officer may take a minor into custody for violation of
this chapter pursuant to Iowa Code § 232.19 for the limited purpose of
detaining the minor until he or she can be reunited with the minor’s family
or guardian or other responsible adult or if the peace officer has probable
cause to believe that the minor has committed a delinquent act which if
committed by an adult would constitute a public offense. A peace officer who
takes a minor into custody shall not place bodily restraints, such as
handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens
physical violence when being taken into custody. A minor shall not be placed
in detention following a curfew violation.

notify the adult responsible for the minor as soon as possible. The minor

such person to  produce the minor in court at such time as the court may
direct.



   (D)   If a peace officer determines that a minor does not have adult
supervision because the peace officer cannot locate the minor’s parent,
guardian or other person legally responsible for the care of the minor within
a reasonable period of time, the peace officer shall attempt to place the
minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the
minor or another adult person who is known to the minor.

§ 133.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit the use,
possession with intent to use, manufacture and delivery of drug
paraphernalia, as defined herein.



(2011 Code, § 11.0352.1)



   (B)   Legislative intent. It is the purpose and intent of the City
Council to promote the health, safety and morals of the citizens of the city.
The use or administration of controlled substances is clearly illegal. The
banning of all objects in close connection and adapted for the use of
controlled substances should also be controlled because of the lack of social
or practical purposes of such objects or paraphernalia, whether the use be by
adults or minors. It is also strong public policy to protect children from
the unsupervised exposure and familiarity of drug paraphernalia. In addition
to education about the items in school and at home, it is also essential to
discourage open use, possession, manufacture and commerce of these
drug-related items.



(2011 Code, § 11.0352.8)

circumstances:



            1.   Reasonable time to inspect. If the Inspector

the minimum reasonable period of time which the Inspector determines is
needed by the owner to bring the dwelling unit into compliance with all of
the requirements of this chapter.

initial inspection of the dwelling unit. An initial inspection of a dwelling
unit may also be conducted either at the request of a tenant of the dwelling
unit, or if the Inspector receives a written complaint which, if verified,
would establish a violation of any provision of this chapter. Upon compliance
with all requirements noted in the initial inspection report, and upon
payment of all necessary fees, the Inspector shall issue a minimum rental
housing occupancy permit with respect to such dwelling unit.



   (C)   Effect of issuance of occupancy permit.

permit for a dwelling unit shall not be construed to mean that the dwelling
unit complies with the provisions of this chapter or with any of the
provisions of any other chapters of this code, including, but not limited to,
city zoning.



      (2)   After issuance of a minimum rental housing occupancy
permit for a dwelling unit, if it is determined that the dwelling unit, or

of the provisions of this chapter, the Inspector is authorized and directed
to require the owner to bring said dwelling unit or structure into compliance

            2.   The owner has sold the property upon which
the dwelling unit is located in an arm’s length transaction to an unrelated

         (c)   Such other circumstances exist as, in the
reasonable judgment of the Board, justify removal of some or all of the
infraction points theretofore assessed against the owner of the dwelling unit.

§ 153.03  PARK DEVELOPMENT PLAN.



   (A)   Plan required. No mobile home shall be located or altered, or
land or water used, nor shall any certificate of occupancy be issued therefor
by the Building Official unless and until the required mobile home park
development plan is officially approved by resolution of the City Council and
the required licensing provisions of Iowa Code Ch. 562B are complied with.
Application for the approval of such development plan shall be made to the
City Council in writing and the City Council may refer such application to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for recommendations.



   (B)   Plan contents.



      (1)   The proposed mobile home park development plan shall
show the following:



         (a)   Topography with topographic lines at a minimum of
five-foot intervals;



         (b)   Park boundaries and dimensions; and



         (c)   Location and area of all uses, including streets
adjacent to and within the park, walks, patios, mobile home stands; play
areas, parks and common open spaces, parking areas, utilities including
street lighting and fire hydrants, physical features, such as retaining
walls, fences, trees and natural features; other information that may be
required by the Planning, Engineering, Traffic, Fire, Health, Water or
Building Departments; easements and dedications.

landscape architect, architect, engineer, land surveyor or other experienced
designer, and have the seal of a duly authorized engineer or land surveyor in
the state certifying boundaries, boundary measurements and such other matters
as are required to be so approved by the city platting ordinance.



   (C)   Zoning and site plan compliance. The proposed mobile home park
development plan shall be in accordance with the site design plan approved by
the City Council with the R-MH zoning granted for the proposed mobile home
park.



   (D)   Construction and maintenance. Every mobile home park shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with the approved mobile home park
development plan.



   (E)   Location of mobile homes. All mobile homes shall be located
and maintained in full conformity with the approved mobile home park
development plan.



   (F)   Criteria for approval. In approving mobile home parks, the
City Council shall consider the location, size, height, spacing and extent of
use of any mobile home and their appurtenances, access and circulation for
vehicles and pedestrians, streets, parking areas, yards and open spaces and
the relationship to adjacent property. The city’s Planning and Zoning
Commission shall not recommend nor the city adopt such mobile home park
development plan unless it finds that such plan conforms to all applicable
provisions of this chapter.



   (G)   Streets and utilities. If such mobile home park development
plan contains no dedication to the city for streets or utilities, or should
it be contemplated that the facilities of the city shall not be used for
maintenance of streets, sidewalks, water and sewer lines, garbage collection
or other related functions, then such owner shall be required to record with
such mobile home park plan a covenant that such owner will maintain such
streets, sidewalks, water and sewer lines in compliance with the minimum
standards as established by the city and that should the owner fail to
maintain such standards in any of these respects, after ten days’ notice to
such owner, effect all necessary repairs or improvements as required to
maintain such minimum standards and the cost of all these and necessary
repairs or improvements shall become a lien against such real estate and
enforced and recorded as mechanic’s liens are enforced and recorded against
such real estate, and such covenant shall contain the following proviso:
“that                           , being the owner or owners of
the real estate contained in the above attached mobile home park development
plan, hereby consent that if they, or their assignees, heirs or those holding
or owning said land through said owners, fail to maintain the streets,
sidewalks, water and sewer mains according to and in compliance with the
minimum standards for the maintenance of streets, sidewalks, water and sewer
mains as established by the city that, after ten days’ notice in writing to
the owner of said land as shown upon the records in the County Auditor’s
office of Jasper County, Iowa, and at the address therein shown, then said
owner, assignees, heirs, and those holding or owning through said owners,
hereby authority the city of Newton, Iowa, to make all necessary repairs and
perform all necessary maintenance and further authorize the City of Newton,
Iowa, to file a mechanic’s lien or such other lien or encumbrance against
said real estate and enforce said lien pursuant to laws then applicable.”



   (H)   Amended plans. Amending procedure and re-submission of plan
for approval as to undeveloped area.



      (1)   If it is found necessary to make material and
substantial alterations or modifications to an approved mobile home park
development plan, such alterations or modifications shall be subject to the
approval of the City Council.



      (2)   A request for approval of alterations or modifications
of a previously approved mobile home park development plan shall be
accompanied by the same kind and number of exhibits as is required for a new
request for approval insofar as such exhibits are applicable to the requested
alterations or modifications. When the City Council, by official resolution,
approves the revised mobile home park development plan, such revised plan
will supplant the original approved mobile home park development plan.



      (3)   If the total area covered in the mobile home park
development plan is not developed within the period of three years, then the
approval of the City Council as to the original plan shall expire as to the
undeveloped portion of such area and a new plan must be submitted to the
Council as to such undeveloped area containing such revisions and changed as
may be necessary by reason of any changes that may have occurred in the
environmental conditions and general area in which the plan is located.

Editor’s note:



   Iowa Code Ch. 135D has been replaced with Iowa Code Ch. 562B



§ 153.08  VARIATIONS.



   Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is of such unusual size or
shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the
strict application of the requirements contained in these regulations would
result in substantial hardships or injustice, the Council, upon
recommendation of the City Planning and Zoning Commission, may vary or modify
such requirements so that the developer is allowed to develop the property in
a reasonable manner, but so, at the same time, the public welfare and
interests of the city and surrounding area are protected and the general
intent and spirit of these regulations are preserved.

each corner of the mobile home stand to provide a readily accessible anchor
for the mobile home and each shall be able to sustain a minimum tensile
strength of 2,800 pounds.



   (D)   Skirting required. Skirting of a permanent type material and
construction shall be installed to enclose the open space between the bottom
of a mobile home floor and the grade level of the mobile home stand and shall
be so constructed to provide substantial resistance to heavy winds, thereby
alleviating to the maximum extent possible lifting action created on the
underside of the mobile home by heavy winds.



   (E)   Skirting standards. Sufficient screened, ventilating area
shall be installed in the skirting to supply the combustion requirements of
heating units and other ventilating requirements of the mobile home.
Provision shall be made for easy removal of a section large enough to permit
access for inspection of the enclosed area under the mobile home and for

on the effective date of this chapter, shall be removed from the curb or from
its starting point on city owned right-of-way, to the property line. The area
disturbed shall be restored and reseeded. Any structure or other manmade
object (excluding driveways and sidewalks) located on city-owned right-of-way

installations in such right-of-way, shall be removed at the expense of the
city or the public utility, and shall not be restored, rebuilt, or replaced
on city-owned right-of-way. The area disturbed shall be restored and reseeded
at the expense of the city or public utility.

in a timely manner, the city shall perform the removal and assess the cost

PLATS OF SURVEY



§ 156.110  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide an approval
procedure for the first two divisions of a 40-acre aliquot part or the
division of a platted lot and the transfer of ownership to the individual
parts thereof. This process shall be allowed where all required improvements
are in place as specified in §§ 156.007 and 156.150 through 156.160 or no
public improvements are proposed. To allow for staff review and approval of
lot splits, lot line adjustments and the division of duplex ownership.



(Ord. 2217, passed 11-4-2013)



§ 156.111  APPLICABILITY.



   For the purposes of this chapter, the owner may be eligible to submit a
plat of survey if any of the following conditions are met:



   (A)   Lot line adjustment. A lot line adjustment consists of the
resetting of an interior lot line between lots in a platted subdivision to
reconfigure, consolidate, or adjust the boundaries of adjoining lots, which
do not violate the Zoning Ordinance.



   (B)   Division of tract into two parcels. A division of a tract into
two parcels where all city service systems and public improvements are
extended so that each system is readily accessible for direct and individual
connection from each lot in the subdivision.



   (C)   Division of duplex lots. Where a side-by-side residential
duplex dwelling is legally constructed on an existing lot located in a
subdivision for which the subdivision plat has been duly recorded, and
providing that the dwelling met the bulk zoning regulations at the time it
was constructed, the lot may thereafter be divided to provide individual
ownership of the duplex units by the following procedure:



      (1)   A plat of survey showing the as-built location of the
duplex structure on the lot shall be filed with the Director of Planning and
Zoning. The plat of survey shall provide a reference to this code section and
indicate the purpose for which the plat is prepared. The plat shall also
locate the new ownership division line along the common wall of the structure
and provide individual legal descriptions for each new parcel. If approved by
the Director of Planning and Zoning and Public Works Director and following
review and approval by the County Auditor and Recorder, a deed may thereafter
be recorded effecting the lot division. A copy of the recorded deeds and plat
of survey shall be filed with the city.



      (2)   In the event the duplex or part thereof is removed or
destroyed, the duplex unit may be reproduced or reconstructed as before but
the newly created lots may not otherwise be considered buildable lots unless
the proposed construction meets the zoning setback and bulk requirements for
the zoning district in which it is located.

§ 156.113  REVIEW.



   The Director of Planning and Zoning and the Public Works Director shall
review the application prior to submittal to the County Recorder and Auditor.
The city shall review a plat of survey within ten business days of submittal
and either approve or return to the applicant with a request for additional
information. Upon resubmittal, the city shall approve the plat unless it
violates existing city ordinances or state law, except in the case of duplex
division with respect to minimum lot size and lot coverage. Upon approval,
the plat shall be filed in accordance with Iowa Coded Ch. 355 or applicable
succeeding chapters of the state statutes and one recorded copy shall be
returned within seven days to the Director of Planning and Zoning for use in
maintaining the city’s plat records. Failure to return a recorded copy

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS



§ 156.150  GENERAL.



   The method and financing by which public improvements are installed in
a subdivision is a matter of mutual concern to the developer and the city.
These improvements become permanent features of the community and could be a
financial burden to the developer and a continual maintenance cost to the
city. It is the intent of this chapter to provide for adequately sized,
properly located and properly installed improvements through the prescribed
rules and minimum standards of this chapter. The developer shall construct
and install the improvements in accordance with the city standard
specifications for construction within the public right-of-way. Upon approval
of both the preliminary plat and the construction plans as required within
these regulations, the developer may construct and install the required
subdivision improvements.

§ 156.151  BOND REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Performance bonds for improvements shall be in full force and
effect until acceptance of the improvements by the city at which time the
maintenance bonding period shall commence. Maintenance bonds will then be in
full force and effect throughout the duration of the bond period as set by
this chapter.



   (B)   The amount of all bonds or acceptable collateral shall not be
less than the estimated cost of the dedicated improvements, including all
inspection services and tests conducted by the city. The amount of the
estimate of the bond or acceptable collateral must be approved by the Public
Works Director.



      (1)   Performance bond. The subdivider may post a surety bond,
cash bond or certified check with the city, guaranteeing that said
improvements will be constructed within a period of two years from City
Council approval of the final plat, however, if surety bond, cash bond or
certified check is posted, City Council approval of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the city of any improvements to be
constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has
been completed and inspection by appropriate city personnel certifying the
improvements have been completed in conformance with specifications and the
minimum standards of the city. No public funds will be expended in the
subdivision until such improvements have been completed and accepted by the
city. The performance bond shall be utilized for the public improvements not
completed at the time of filing of the final plat and include but are not
limited to all work associated with:



         (a)   Street construction including grading, subbase
aggregate, pavement, curb and gutters;

      (1)   The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Newton Municipal Airport;



      (2)   It is necessary in the interest of the public health,
public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and



      (3)   The prevention of these obstructions should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power without compensation.



      (4)   It is further declared that the prevention of the
creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination,
removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation, or the
marking and lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a
political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or
interests in land.



   (C)   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Airport
Height Regulations and Use of Property in Vicinity Ordinance”.

(2011 Code, § 53.0102)



§ 157.03  AIRPORT SURFACES AND HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.



   (A)   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter there are
hereby created and established certain surfaces which include all of the land
lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal
surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Newton Municipal Airport.
Such zones are shown on the Newton Municipal Airport Zoning Map which is
attached to this Chapter and made a part hereof. An area located in more than
one of the following surfaces is considered to be in only the zone with the
more restrictive height limitation. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree
shall be allowed to grow in any surface created by this chapter to a height
in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such surface.



   (B)   The various surfaces and such height limitations are hereby
established and defined as follows.



      (1)   Horizontal surface. The horizontal surface is a
horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the
perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from
the center of the end of the primary surface on each end of runway 14/32 and
connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.



      (2)   Conical surface. The conical surface extends outward and
upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.



      (3)   Primary surface. The primary surface is a surface
longitudinally centered on a runway and extends 200 feet beyond each end of
that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as
the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the
primary surface is 250 feet for runway 5/23 and the width is 1,000 feet on
runway 14/32.



      (4)   Approach surface. The approach surface is a surface
longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending
outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. The inner edge of
the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and expands
uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet for runway ends 5 and 23; 4,000 feet for
runway end 14; and 16,000 feet for runway end 32. The approach surface
extends for a horizontal distance of 5,000 at a slope of 20:1 for runway ends
5 and 23; 10,000 feet at a slope of 34:1 for runway end 14; and 10,000 feet
at a slope of 50:1 with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40:1 for
runway end 32.



      (5)   Transitional surface. The transitional surface extends
outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway
centerline extended at a slope of 7:1 from the sides of the primary surface
and from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those
portion of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond
the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured
horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the
runway centerline.



(2011 Code, § 53.0103)



§ 157.04  USE RESTRICTIONS.



   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in
the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of
the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.



(2011 Code, § 53.0104)



§ 157.05  NON-CONFORMING USES



   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by
this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of non-conforming use. Nothing contained herein shall
require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any
structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of this chapter and is diligently prosecuted.



   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding division (A) above, the
owner of any existing non- conforming structure or tree is hereby required to
permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the City Planner to indicate to
the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such
airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and
maintained at the expense of the city.



(2011 Code, § 53.0105)



§ 157.06  PERMITS.



   (A)   Future uses.



      (1)   Except as specifically provided in divisions (A)(1)(a),
(A)(1)(b) and (A)(1)(c) below, no material change shall be made in the use of
land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree
shall be  planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall
have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use,
structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such
determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit
for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted
unless a variance has been approved in accordance with division (D) below.



         (a)   In the area lying within the limits of the
horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,
because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.



         (b)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach
zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end
of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or
structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach
zones.



         (c)   In the area lying within the limits of the
transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.



      (2)   Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions
shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or
alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the
height limits established by this chapter, except as set forth in division
(D) below.



   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a non-conforming use,
structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is
when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.



   (C)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the City
Planner determines that a non-conforming tree or structure has been abandoned
or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit
shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.



   (D)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height
of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the
Board of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for
variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application
or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and
relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create
a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice and will be in
accordance with the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for
variance to the requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board
of Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the
Newton City Planner for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the City Planner does not respond to the application within 15
days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or
deny said application.



   (E)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance
granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of
this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate
and maintain, at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be
necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this condition may be
modified to require the owner to permit the city, at its own expense, to
install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.



(2011 Code, § 53.0106)



§ 157.07  ENFORCEMENT.



   It shall be the duty of the City Planner to administer and enforce the
regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall
be made to the City Planner upon a form published for that purpose.
Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the City Planner
shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by
the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the City Planner.



(2011 Code, § 53.0107)



§ 157.08  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



   (A)   It is hereby ordered that the City Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall have and exercise the following powers:



      (1)   To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the City Planner in the enforcement of this
chapter;



      (2)   To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of
this chapter upon which such Board of Adjustment under such regulations may
be required to pass; and



      (3)   To hear and decide specific variances.



   (B)   The Board of Adjustment shall make written findings of facts
and conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal
conclusions from such facts upon which it acted and its legal conclusions
from such facts in reversing, affirming or modifying any order, requirement,
decision or determination which comes before it under the provisions of this
chapter.



   (C)   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Board
of Adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of the City Planner or decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect
variation to this chapter.



(2011 Code, § 53.0108)



§ 157.09  APPEALS.

FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT




§ 158.045  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATIONS.



   The legislature of the state has, in Iowa Code Ch. 414, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety
from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.



(2011 Code, § 34.04050.02)



§ 158.046  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extra-ordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.



   (B)   These flood losses, hazards and related adverse effects are
caused by:



      (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable
to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and



      (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.



(2011 Code, § 34.04050.03)



§ 158.047  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the city and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing those flood losses described in § 158.046(A) of this
chapter with provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction or substantial improvement;



   (C)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited
for intended purposes because of flood hazard; and



   (D)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in
the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood
Insurance Program.

shall not issue permits for variances, except as directed by the city’s
Board of Adjustment.



   (D)   Construction and use to be as provided in application and
plans. Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans
and applications authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set
forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement
or construction. Any use, arrangement or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this subchapter. The applicant
shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land
surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the state, that the finished fill,
building floor elevations, flood-proofing or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, prior
to the use or occupancy of any structure.



   (E)   Variance.



      (1)   General. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon
request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this subchapter
that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter will
result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following
applicable standards.



         (a)   Variances shall only be granted upon:



            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



            2.   A determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



            3.   A determination that the granting of the
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or
ordinances.



         (b)   Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.



         (c)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that:



            1.   The issuance of a variance will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage; and



            2.   Such construction increases risks to life and
property.



      (2)   Factors upon which the decision of the Board of
Adjustment shall be based. In passing upon applications for variances, the
Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this
subchapter and:



         (a)   The danger to life and property due to increased
flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments;



         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other
land or downstream to the injury of others;



         (c)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems
and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions;



         (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;



         (e)   The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the city;



         (f)   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain
location;



         (g)   The availability of alternative locations not
subject to flooding for the proposed use;



         (h)   The compatibility of the proposed use with
existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;



         (i)   The relationship of the proposed use to the
Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for the area;



         (j)   The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;



         (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of
rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site;



         (l)   The cost of providing governmental services during
and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and
bridges; and



         (m)   Such other factors which are relevant to the
purpose of this chapter.



      (3)   Conditions attached to variances. Upon consideration of
the factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of
this subchapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited
to:



         (a)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply
facilities;

         (c)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties and
deed restrictions;



         (d)   Requirements for construction of channel
modifications, dikes, levees and other protective measures; provided, such
are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only
practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this subchapter; and



         (e)   Flood-proofing measures.



(2011 Code, § 34.04050.27)



§ 158.070  NON-CONFORMING USES.



   (A)   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was
lawful before the passage or amendment of this subchapter, but which is not
in conformity with the provisions of this subchapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions.



      (1)   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months,
any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.



      (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances
shall not be entitled to continue as non-conforming uses.



   (B)   If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more
than 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the

PFD: PRAIRIE FIRE DESIGN OVERLAY DISTRICT




§ 158.085  INTRODUCTION.



   (A)   The Prairie Fire Design Overlay District is intended to create
a sense of place and individual identity of this development area through the
application of design guidelines and standards. “Prairie Fire” is a
reflection of this area’s environmental heritage in the prairie landscape
as well as the dynamic and rejuvenating effect fire has in that environment.
The city hopes that this becomes an area of excitement, invigoration and
restoration. Presently, the district is a blank slate that has potential of
being developed into a high-quality area that residents take pride in and
visitors take note of. These guidelines and standards rely on the natural
environment as well as landscaping, infrastructure and way-finding signage
that is being implemented by the city to guide new architectural design, sign
design and site planning in the district.



   (B)   The Prairie Fire Design Overlay District is located south of
Interstate 80 at exit 168. Because of its location south of the interstate
and away from the downtown, this area will most likely be automobile oriented
with pedestrian activity coming from future trail systems in the area. It is
important that these design guidelines are implemented consistently as future
development occurs to create an identifiable area that is highly visible from
the interstate.



   (C)   While the city wants to encourage development styles which
complement the surrounding natural environment, public infrastructure and
other private buildings, the purpose of the design district is not to create
an entirely homogeneous area. The city encourages the pursuit of individual
business identity within these guidelines.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.1)



§ 158.086  BOUNDARIES.



   The boundaries of the Prairie Fire Design Overlay District are shown on
the map in Figure 1. The City Zoning Map also indicates where the Prairie
Fire Design Overlay District is. The boundaries include (clockwise):  The
City limits line on the eastern and southern boundaries, the airport property
line, a line even with East 28th Street South (the N-S section of Rusty
Wallace Drive), Interstate 80, the property line of the existing park and
South 13th Avenue East. As the city incorporates additional land into its
limits in the future, the boundaries will most likely change and expand.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.2)



§ 158.087  GOALS AND PRINCIPLES.



   (A)   Goals. The Prairie Fire Design Overlay District provides
guidelines and standards intended to promote and enhance the identity of the
area and create a sense of place. The Planning and Zoning Commission
generated these goals in the Spring of 2006. Specifically, the goals for
overlay district are:



      (1)   To promote storefront, shopping center or industrial
building design that enhances the physical appearance of the corridor and
establishes an identity distinguishing it from development found elsewhere on
Interstate 80 and in the state;



      (2)   To promote the application of these design guidelines
while still allowing companies to maintain their own identity and ability to
be easily recognized by the general public; and



      (3)   To promote individual site planning to ensure that the
internal and external vehicular and pedestrian circulation pattern in the
district is safe and easy to navigate.



   (B)   Design principles. The Prairie Fire Design Overlay District is
based upon the following set of principles.



      (1)   Consistency. The city hopes that development in the
district will be diverse and feature a mixture of development types such as
shopping centers, hotels, restaurants, recreational facilities and museums.
Design of all these facilities is guided by the individual business use and
site constraints. Within that context, development within the district should
maintain a consistency and compatibility between the different uses through
the selection of exterior surface materials, landscape materials and sign
programs.



      (2)   Safety. Public safety is critical to the success of
commercially zoned districts. Public safety not only refers to safety from
criminal activity, but also safety for automobile and pedestrian traffic.
This can be addressed through site planning considerations such as lighting,
landscaping, internal sidewalks and bike/walking trails.



      (3)   Simplicity. Simplicity refers to the reduction of visual
clutter and the implementation of an architectural/sign/site design that fits
into the existing and future development of the whole district.



      (4)   Organically. Organically refers to the style of
development the city hopes to see occur within the district. The prairie is
the source of inspiration for the district, and the city wants building and
landscape designs to reflect that natural environment. Highly manicured
plantings and shrubs, as shown in Image 2, would not likely fit into this
natural development style. In addition to reflecting this natural
environment, landscaping, erosion controls and layouts should also work to
protect and restore the prairie.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.3)



§ 158.088  ADMINISTRATION.



   (A)   General. All projects within this district will be reviewed
for compliance with the design guidelines before approval of a development
plan and issuance of a building or sign permit. All development projects
within the Prairie Fire Design Overly District are subject to administrative
approval within 15 working days after submittal of the application for
development plan approval.



   (B)   Required submittal materials. The following elements are
required when submitting a development plan in the Prairie Fire Design
Overlay District for administrative approval. In addition to the requirements
of Ch. 155 of this code of ordinances, the following items should also be
submitted as part of the development plan:



      (1)   Architectural drawings of buildings and structures that
include photographs or catalog cuts of building materials when available;



      (2)   Copy of the sign program for the subdivision that
indicates location of the high-rise signage;



      (3)   Detailed landscaping plan;



      (4)   Design details of signage;



      (5)   Design details of lighting fixtures; and



      (6)   Design detail of fences and free-standing walls.



   (C)   Maintenance.



      (1)   Design guidelines are only one part of the equation for
producing and keeping a high-quality development area over time. It is the
responsibility of the individual properties to maintain their site in a
presentable manner.



      (2)   The following guidelines should be followed in addition
to the guidelines found in Ch. 94 of this code of ordinances.



         (a)   Landscaping shall be maintained appropriately.
Dead plant material shall be removed and replaced with the same or similar
type plant.



         (b)   Broken curbing, sidewalks or other pavement shall
be patched and repaired in accordance with the approved site plan when
necessary.



         (c)   The space behind a curb shall be properly
back-filled and seeded. Image 3 illustrates poorly maintained grass behind a
curb.



         (d)   Painted parking spaces, traffic lanes and
directional arrows in the parking area shall be maintained to a level that is
clearly visible.



         (e)   Building exteriors should be consistently
maintained by painting, power-washing and/or repairing/replacing broken
exterior materials.



   (D)   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions on projects within the
Prairie Fire Design Overlay District shall occur in the same manner as site
plan decisions. If the submitted plan is administratively disapproved or the
City Planner has not taken action within 15 working days of the submittal of
the plan, the applicant shall have the privilege of requesting Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council review and action. It is the
responsibility of the applicant to file a written appeal with the City
Planner no later than ten working days after the City Planner’s decision to
ensure a Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council hearing date, review
and action.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.4)



§ 158.089  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   ARTICULATION. The interruption of the building, fence, wall or other
structure facade through the use of directional change, depth change,
awnings, arches, display windows, change in materials, or other architectural
elements which provide interest and texture. Image 4 illustrates both
horizontal and vertical ARTICULATION.



   ECLECTIC. Composed of elements from a variety of sources, systems,
materials or styles.



   FENCE, SCREENING. A fence that is constructed of a solid material, such
as wood, that serves the purpose of concealing or hiding.



   HARMONY. The implementation of site and architectural style that works
with and complements the development patterns and style as well as the
natural environment of the surrounding area.



   OVERLAY DISTRICT. A district which is placed on top of the base zoning
to modify the development guidelines and to achieve a specific purpose for
that area. The regulations of the underlying zoning district and all other
regulations remain in effect.



   SIGN, FREE-STANDING. A sign that is not attached to a building.



   SIGN, HIGH RISE. A free-standing sign that is oriented toward the
interstate and is typically larger in size and taller than other
free-standing signs.



   SIGN, POLE. A free-standing sign where a sign face or sign faces are
attached to a single pole or multiple poles and are not enclosed by a framing
element. Image 5 illustrates a POLE SIGN.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.5)



§ 158.090  GENERAL DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS.



   (A)   The purpose of these guidelines and standards are to promote
high-quality development and serve as an extension of the Zoning,
Subdivision, and Site Plan Ordinances. The city has established consistency
between these ordinances and this design overlay district. However, in some
instances, these guidelines are more restrictive than the Zoning, Subdivision
or Site Plan Ordinances. Whenever the case, the most restrictive regulations
shall apply.



   (B)   As noted earlier, the city encourages businesses to pursue
their individual identities within these guidelines. Because today’s market
has such a vast selection of building materials, the city does not wish to
advocate the use of any one particular material. However, the city does wish
to advocate the use of materials that are going to produce high-quality
construction and landscaping that will enhance the look and feel of the
district. Throughout the following guidelines and standards, pictures and
sketches are used to convey the expectation in quality, feel and appearance.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.6)



§ 158.091  EXTERIOR FINISH AND BUILDING DESIGN.

         (b)   At least two different building materials shall be
incorporated into the exterior finish to increase visual interest.
Highlighting architectural elements, such as changes in facade plane, is
encouraged. Image 6 illustrates how multiple building materials can be
incorporated into the exterior finish and can be used to highlight
architectural elements.



   (B)   (1)   Guideline 2. To encourage the use of architectural
elements to provide visual interest and interrupt long facade expanses.



      (2)   Standards.

identifiable and could be projected or recessed to create visual interest.



         (c)   A combined use of arches, awnings, display
windows, articulation, changes in building materials, or other architectural
features shall be incorporated into the building design. Image 7 illustrates
how a combination of awnings, different building materials, windows and
height changes break up a long wall on a large retail store.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.7)



§ 158.092  FREESTANDING WALLS AND FENCES.

design principles.



   (B)   Standards.



      (1)   Free-standing walls and fences shall have both vertical
and horizontal facade articulation. Vertical articulation shall be required
for structures six feet or more in height and can be achieved through the
addition of stepping, landscaping or addition of visual interest. Horizontal
articulation shall be required for structures over 75 feet in length and
shall include a change in depth of at least three feet.



      (2)   Free-standing walls and fences shall incorporate design
elements and building materials found within the site it is located on as
well as complement the surrounding sites and public infrastructure.



(2011 Code, § 34.04060.8)



§ 158.093  SIGN PROGRAM.



   (A)   (1)   Guideline 1. Enhance the individuality of businesses
through the use of individual company logos and color schemes while still
promoting the characteristics of the design district and reducing “sign
clutter”.



      (2)   Standards.



         (a)   Commercial and industrial sites within the design
overlay may have only one individual free-standing sign on-site at the
district level. Utilization of the district level free-standing sign is
exclusive from utilization of a high-rise sign when allowed. Total number of
signs (including wall, projecting, mansard or free-standing) and maximum

SPECIFIC REGULATIONS




§ 158.110  ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.



   (A)   Location. Detached accessory buildings, which do not include a
residential use within the structure, may be located no closer than three
feet to any side or rear property line and no closer than four feet to any
other building or structure on the property. Attached accessory buildings or
structures shall be considered part of the building to which they are
attached, and shall not occupy any portion of a required yard.



   (B)   Time of construction. No accessory building or structure shall
be constructed on any lot prior to the start of construction of the principal
building to which it is accessory.



   (C)   Percentage of required rear yard occupied. No accessory
building or structures or a total of all accessory building and structures
shall occupy more than 40% of the area of the required rear yard.



   (D)   Height of accessory buildings or structures on residential
lots. No detached accessory building or structure located on a residential
lot shall exceed a height of 15 feet.



   (E)   Accessory buildings requiring conditional use permit. When the
requirements of a zoning district dictate that a conditional use permit is
required for the construction of an accessory building or structure with a
footprint greater than 1,000 square feet, the Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall review the proposal in accordance with § 158.178(CC) of this chapter
and the following criteria.



      (1)   Location. Location and setback allowances stipulated in
division (A) above do not apply in the instance that the proposed accessory
building or structure is only permissible with the issuance of a conditional
use permit. Standard setback requirements for the zoning district in which
the property is located shall dictate the minimum setback requirements.



      (2)   Screening. When a conditional use permit is required,
the Zoning Board of Adjustment may require screening from adjoining
properties only when the distance between the proposed structure and the
adjoining property line is 30 feet or less. Screening may consist of, but is
not limited to, plantings and landscaping or solid style fencing.



      (3)   Drainage. When a conditional use permit is required, the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall determine that the construction of the
accessory building or structure does not negatively impact storm water
drainage in the neighborhood.



      (4)   Visual interest. When a conditional use permit is
required, accessory buildings, located on properties two acres in size or
less, shall provide exterior decorative feature(s) to create visual interest
along exterior walls that are greater than 40 feet in length. Visual interest
features may include, but are not limited to, multiple exterior siding
materials or colors, windows or wall plane articulation.

§ 158.111  ADULT USES.



   (A)   Adult uses in business districts which are immediately
adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods have a deleterious
effect on both the business and the residential segments of the neighborhood.
The establishment of more than two adult uses within 1,000 feet of each other
compounds this deleterious effect. Control of the location of adult uses is
needed to allow an acceptable level of such uses while maintaining
neighborhoods which meet the expectations of the general public.



   (B)   An adult use shall not be located within 1,000 feet of another
adult use, nor shall they be located within 1,000 feet of any public or
parochial school, licensed day care facility, church, public park,
residential zoning district or any dwelling (one-family, two-family or
multi-dwelling).



   (C)   The 1,000 feet restrictions shall be computed by measurement
from the residential zone or from the nearest property line of the land used
for another adult use or any public or parochial school, licensed day care
facility, church, public park, residential zoning district or any dwelling to
the nearest entrance of the building in which adult uses are to occur, using
a route of direct measured horizontal distance.



   (D)   All buildings openings, entries, windows and the like shall be
covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior
from any public or semi-public area. Advertisements, displays or other
promotional materials shall not be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to
the public from pedestrian sidewalks, walkways or from other public or
semi-public areas.

increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of this chapter, except in compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. Use or occupation of an area of land is intended to mean
only that land which is actually utilized by the non-conforming use and shall
not be interpreted to include a larger area of land by virtue of ownership,
intent to use or any other argument less than actual use and physical
occupation by the non-conforming use.

non-operative status shall be evidence of discontinued use.



      (8)   Premises used for open storage, signs and billboards not
expressly permitted in residential zoning districts in which they are located
and where such uses existed prior to adoption of this chapter shall
discontinue use upon adoption of this chapter and shall not be permitted to
continue as non-conforming uses. Any such uses shall be in violation of this
chapter.



      (9)   Structural alterations may be made to non-conforming
buildings to meet the minimum requirements of other city codes and to
maintain the building in a safe condition.



      (10)   Any use of land, use of structure or any structure in
existence at the time of adoption of this chapter which was not an authorized
non-conformity under previous zoning chapters, shall not be authorized to
continue its non-conforming status pursuant to this chapter or amendments
thereto.

building may be enlarged or extended only if the addition is made to conform
to all the regulations of the district in which it is located; provided that,
the Board of Adjustment may authorize additions to and enlargements of
non-conforming uses as an authorized variance without insisting upon the
requirement of this section.

§ 158.118  TOWERS AND WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS.



   (A)   Applicability and findings.



      (1)   The provisions of this section shall apply to the
display, construction, erection, alteration other than normal maintenance and
location of all towers, wireless communications facilities, and wind energy
conversion system structures. This section applies to all free-standing or
building-mounted towers, antennas, wireless communication facilities or wind
energy conversion systems located on privately owned communication facilities
or wind energy conversion systems located on privately owned or publically
owned property. All towers, wireless communications facilities and wind
energy conversion systems shall obtain a conditional use permit from the
Zoning Board of Adjustment only after meeting the general site requirements
as herein established.



      (2)   Wind energy conversion systems. The city finds that wind
energy is an abundant, renewable and non-polluting energy resource and that
its conversion to electricity will reduce our dependence on non-renewable
energy resources and decrease the air and water pollution that results form
the use of non-renewable energy sources. The state has enacted a number of
laws and programs to encourage the use of small-scale renewable energy
systems, include net metering, sales tax exemptions, property tax exemptions,
production tax credits and the small wind innovation zone program.



      (3)   Wireless communication facilities. The city finds that
wireless communication facilities provide the necessary connectivity for
citizens, businesses, and visitors. Provision of wireless communication
facilities in a manner which is not detrimental to neighborhoods is a benefit
to the community.



   (B)   Amateur radio, private or other non-commercial antennas. This
section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that
is under 75 feet in height and id owned and operated by a federally-licensed
amateur radio station operator or is exclusively for receive-only antennas.
In addition, this section shall not apply to free-standing or
building-mounted apparatuses that are less than five feet in height as
measured form the base of the apparatus to the top, including any
accessories. However building or election permits may still be required for
apparatuses that are less than five feet in height, depending upon the use of
the specific apparatus.



   (C)   Pre-existing towers, antennas and wind energy conversion
systems. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued
prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be required to meet the
requirements of this section, other than the requirements of the FAA and FCC.
Any such towers, antennas or wind energy conversion systems shall be referred
to as “pre-existing towers,” “pre-existing antennas” or
“pre-existing wind energy conversion systems.”

         SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM. A wind energy
conversion system that has a rated capacity of up to 100 kilowatts. A system
is considered a SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM only if it supplies
electrical power solely for on-site use; except that, when a parcel on which
the system is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a utility
company, excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for
on-site use may be used by the utility company in accordance with Iowa
Administrative Code.



         SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION. A substantial modification
includes any of the following events: increasing the existing structures
vertical height, adding an additional appurtenance to the existing structure,
or any other changes that do not comply with the issued approvals for the
existing facility or structure.



      (2)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas, wireless
communications facilities, and towers may be considered either principal or
accessory uses. Small wind energy conversion systems and dispersed wind
energy conversion systems shall be an accessory use and shall not be placed
within the public right-of-way.



      (3)   Bulk and form regulations. For the purpose of this
section, height shall be measured to include the entire apparatus structure;
height equals the measurement of the tower from the base plus any
accessories, antenna or blade mounted upon the tower. For building mounted
apparatuses, the height of the building is not included in this measurement.



         (a)   Setbacks.



            1.   Privately or publically owned lots. The
minimum distance between any freestanding antenna, wireless communications
facility tower or wind energy conversion system (small wind or dispersed
wind) and any property line shall be a distance that is equivalent to the
height (100%) of the total system height. Building-mounted apparatuses shall
only be located on structures that conform to the setback requirements for
the district in which they are located per this chapter.



            2.   City public right-of-way. The minimum setback
for any free-standing antenna, tower, or wireless communications facility

platted lots. The maximum height for a tower, wireless communications
facility, antenna or wind energy conversion system shall be a height that is
equal to the setback from any property line up to a maximum of 50 feet in
residential zones and up to a maximum of 100 feet for commercial zones, and
up to a maximum of 150 feet for industrial zones for freestanding
apparatuses. The maximum height for building mounted apparatuses in all zones
shall be equal to or less than 25% of the maximum building height requirement
for the zone in which it is located. For example, a building mounted tower
located in a zone with a 35-foot maximum height requirement shall not have a
height greater than eight and three-fourths feet.



            2.   City public right-of-way. The maximum height
for a tower, wireless communications facility, or antenna located within the
City of Newton public right-of-way is 40 feet in residential zoning
classifications, 60 feet in commercial zoning classifications, and 75 feet in
industrial zoning classifications. The conditional use permit approval
process may further restrict allowable height based on the details and
findings of a specific case.



            3.   In the case that the airport height
restrictions for the city apply to the location on which the structure is to
be erected, the more restrictive, lower height requirement shall apply.



         (c)   Blade clearance. No portion of a propeller-style
wind energy conversion system blade shall extend closer than 30 feet from the
ground on a free-standing apparatus and shall maintain a clearance of ten

§ 158.155  PURPOSES.



   The purposes of the regulations in this subchapter are to:



   (A)   Alleviate existing problems with signs which include among
others, an over-abundance of signs causing clutter and visual pollution, a
number of abandoned, deteriorated and unsafe signs, and flashing portable
signs that distract, confuse, obscure, compete and conflict with motorists’
vision;



   (B)   Ensure that signs are compatible with the individual property,
with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the
community and promote an improved visual environment by encouraging
creativity and flexibility in the design and use of signs;



   (C)   Recognize that the sizes and types of signs which provide
adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented business areas differ from
those necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel
speeds are greater and required setbacks are greater than in pedestrian areas;



   (D)   Promote and protect the public health, safety and general
welfare;



   (E)   Recognize that instances may occur where strict application of
the provisions of this article may deprive a person of the reasonable use of
a sign, and provide a procedure whereby variance from the regulations herein
may, for good cause, be permitted.

§ 158.177  ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.



   (A)   This chapter shall be enforced by the Zoning Administrator.
The Zoning Administrator shall be appointed by the City Council. The Zoning
Administrator shall have the following powers and duties:



      (1)   To issue all zoning permits, certificates of zoning
compliance and provisional use permits required by this chapter;



      (2)   To cause any building, structure, land, place or
premises to be inspected and examined and to order in writing the remedying
of any condition found to exist therein in violation of an provision of this
chapter;



      (3)   To act as advisor to the Planning and Zoning Commission,
City Council and Zoning Board of Adjustment and carry out and enforce any
decisions or determinations of said bodies; and



      (4)   To develop the application forms and administrative
requirements for compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Said forms
and administrative requirements shall be approved by motion of the City
Council.



   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination as to how
all land uses and structures are classified. Unless a use is specifically
listed as permitted, it is prohibited. Any questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall be presented to the Zoning Board of Adjustment only on
appeal from the decision of the Zoning Administrator.



   (C)   If the Board shall find that the ordinance does not reasonably
provide for a proper classification of the subject use, then the Board shall
forward its findings to the City Council and the Planning and Zoning
Commission, with a recommendation for amendment of the ordinance to provide
for proper classification and to designate the zoning district(s) in which
such use may be located.



(2011 Code, § 34.0503)



§ 158.178  PERMITS AND PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Planning and Zoning Commission.



      (1)   Zoning map and zoning ordinance text amendments.



         (a)   Initiation of zoning text amendments. Amendments
to this chapter may be proposed by the City Council and by:



            1.   The Planning and Zoning Commission, as
created by the City Council;



            2.   A resident and/or property owner within the
city; or



            3.   The Zoning Administrator.



         (b)   Initiation of zoning map amendments. Amendments to

            1.   The Planning and Zoning Commission, as
created by the City Council;



            2.   The property owners of 20% or more of the
area involved in the petition presented to the city; or



            3.   The Zoning Administrator.



         (c)   Before submission to City Council. Before
submission to the City Council of the report and recommendations of the
Planning and Zoning Commission on a proposed zoning map amendment or zoning
text amendment, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public
hearing thereon, and, when such hearing is held, the notice of time and place
of such meetings shall be published as prescribed in Iowa Code §§ 362.3 and
414.4 or any successor provisions thereto.



         (d)   Fees for application for amendment. Any
application for an amendment filed by, or on behalf of, the owner or owners
of property affected shall be accompanied by a fee as determined by City
Council resolution.



      (2)   Annexation.  Prior to the annexation of any territory
to the city, a plan of zoning for the area to be annexed shall be forwarded
to the City Council by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   (B)   Zoning Board of Adjustment.



      (1)   Variances.



         (a)   Scope and purpose. The Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall have the authority pursuant to § 158.117 of this chapter to grant a
variance to the regulations of this chapter that will not be contrary to
public interest, where owing to the special conditions a literal enforcement
of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of the chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done.



         (b)   Decision criteria. In deciding upon applications
for variances, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall take into consideration
the extent to which the following conditions have been established by
evidence:



            1.   The particular physical surrounding, shape or
topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a
particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience or loss of revenue if the strict letter of the regulations were
carried out;



            2.   The conditions upon which the requested
variance is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property
within the same zoning classification;



            3.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not
been created by any person presently having an interest in the property;



            4.   The granting of the variance will not be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property
or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;



            5.   The proposed variance will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to the adjacent property, or substantially
increase the congestion in the public streets or increase the danger of fire
or endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property
values within the neighborhood; and



            6.   The proposed variance complies with the
spirit and intent of the restrictions imposed by this chapter.



         (c)   Conditions and restrictions. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions, including limiting
the time the variance is effective, upon the premises benefitted by a
variance as may be necessary to prevent injurious effects therefrom upon
other property in the neighborhood and to better carry out the general intent
of this chapter.



         (d)   Limitations. The provisions of § 158.77 of this
chapter shall not, in any instance, be varied by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment. Variance from other regulations of this chapter shall be granted
by the Zoning Board of Adjustment only in accordance with the standards set
forth herein.



         (e)   Application for; notice of hearing. An application
for variance shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
application shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall, from time to time, prescribe by general
rule. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall meet at the call of the
chairperson and at other such times as the Zoning Board of Adjustment may
determine. The notice of the time and place of such meetings shall be
published as prescribed in Iowa Codes §§ 362.3 and 414.4 or and successor
provisions thereto, to wit: not less than seven, nor more than 20 days before
the date set for the meeting of the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Such notice
shall contain a statement of the particular purpose of such meeting and a
brief description of the location of the property under consideration at such
meeting. All meetings of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be open to the
public.



         (f)   Fees for applications of variances. Any
application for a variance filed by, or on behalf of, the owner or owners of
the property affected shall be accompanied by a fee as determined by City
Council resolution.



      (2)   Conditional uses.



         (a)   Nature and purpose. The formulation and enactment
of comprehensive zoning regulations is based on the division of the entire
city into districts, in each of which are permitted specified uses that are
mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however,
it is recognized that there are other uses, which it may be necessary or
desirable to allow in a given district, but which, because of their potential
influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities, need to be carefully
regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the
community. Such uses are classified in this chapter as conditional uses and
may include the following:



            1.   Uses either municipally operated or operated
by publicly regulated utilities, or uses traditionally affected by public
interest;



            2.   Uses entirely private in character which,
because of their peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they
offer to the public and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood
may have to be established in a district in which they cannot reasonably be
allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulations;



            3.   Non-conforming uses which as conditional uses
can be made more compatible with their surroundings; and



            4.   Uses of a temporary nature, serving a
particular need within definable time limits.



         (b)   Application for conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator upon such
form and accompanied by such information as shall be established from time to
time by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator shall
forward to the Board without delay each such application received.



         (c)   Authorization; revocation. Conditional uses shall
be authorized by a conditional use permit granted by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment, after the Board shall have noticed and held a public hearing and
prepared and filed a finding of fact, thereon. Such permit shall set forth
any restrictions or conditions imposed in the granting thereof. Failure of
the permittee to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall be deemed
cause for the revocation of such permit.



         (d)   Criteria for granting. No conditional use shall be
granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment unless such use:



            1.   Is so designed, located and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;



            2.   Is so designed located, and proposed to be
operated that it is compatible with its surroundings;



            3.   Will not cause substantial injury to the
value of the other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located;
and



            4.   Shall conform to the applicable regulations
of, and be compatible with the essential character of the district in which
it is located.



         (e)   Conditions imposed upon grant. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment may provide such conditions or restrictions upon the construction,
location, and operation of a conditional use, including, but not limited to,
provisions for the protection of adjacent property, the expiration of such
conditional use after a specified period of time, off-street parking and
loading, as shall be deemed necessary to secure the general objectives of
this chapter and to reduce injury to the value of property in the
neighborhood.



         (f)   Authorized improvements. The Zoning Administrator
my authorize any expansion of the size of the building by up to 10% of the
existing or authorized building approved by a conditional use permit;
provided that, the expansion is not in violation of the provisions of the
original conditional use permit.



         (g)   Fees for applications of conditional uses. Any
application for a conditional use filed by or on behalf of, the owner or
owners of the property affected shall be accompanied by a fee as determined
by City Council resolution.



         (h)   Notice of hearing. An application for conditional
use permit shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
application shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall, from time to time, prescribe by general
rule. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall meet at the call of the
chairperson and at other such times as the Board may determine. The notice of
the time and place of such meetings shall be published two times, once not
less than seven, nor more than 17, and once not less than 14 nor more than 20
days before the date set for the meeting of the Board. Notice shall also be
mailed to all property owners within 400 feet of the outside boundaries of
the subject property at least 14 days prior to the meeting date. Notice shall
also be posted prominently in a location on the site at least two weeks in
advance of the hearing. Such notices shall contain a statement of the
particular purpose of such meeting and a brief description of the location of
the property under consideration at such meeting. All meetings of the Board
shall be open to the public.



(2011 Code, § 34.0504)



§ 158.179  APPEALS.



   (A)   Scope of appeal. An appeal may be taken to the Board of
Adjustment by any person or office, department, board or bureau affected by a
decision of the office of the City Planner. The appeal shall specify the
grounds thereof and shall be filed within such time and in such form as may
be prescribed by the Board by general rule. The City Planner, upon request of
the Board of Adjustment, transmit to it all documents, plans and papers
constituting the record of the action from which an appeal was taken.



   (B)   Hearing of appeal. The Board may require the party taking the
appeal to assume the cost of public notice and due notice to interested
parties. At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by
attorney.



   (C)   Staying of work on premises. When an appeal from the decision
of the zoning administrator has been taken and filed with the Board of
Adjustment, all proceedings and work on the premises concerning which the
decision was made shall be stayed unless the City Planner shall certify to
the Board that, by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case a proceeding or work
shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Board of Adjustment or by the district court of the county, on
application, on notice to the City Planner and the owner of the premises
affected and on due cause shown. After the owner, or owner’s agents, or
persons or a corporation in charge of the work on the premises affected have
received notice that an appeal has been filed with the Board of Adjustment,
the City Planner shall have full power to order such work discontinued or
stayed and to call upon the police power of the city to give full force and
effect to the order.



   (D)   Decision on appeal. In exercising its powers, the Board of
Adjustment may, upon the concurring vote of a majority of its members,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from as in its opinion ought to be done in
the premises and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the City Planner.



(2011 Code, § 34.0505)



§ 158.999  PENALTY.



   (A)   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses
to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of
this chapter shall  have committed a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine
of at least $65 but not to exceed $625. Each day such a violation or failure
to comply is permitted to exist after notification thereof shall constitute a
separate offense.



(2011 Code, § 34.0506.1)



   (B)   Violations of the provisions of §§ 158.045 through 158.072
of this chapter or failure to comply with any of the requirements shall
constitute a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least $65 but not
to exceed $625. Each day such a violation or failure to comply is permitted
to exist after notification there of shall constitute a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
