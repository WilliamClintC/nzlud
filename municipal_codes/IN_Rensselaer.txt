(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12) 


35.09 DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE.

(A)    The city expects that all employees will conduct themselves according to generally accepted standards of conduct and performance. When employees do not meet the standards, it is the superintendent/supervisory personnel responsibility to act in a timely manner and initiate a program of remedial steps to address the problem.

(B)    This policy presents the basic principles and procedures of a system of progressive remedial action, often referred to as discipline, which is intended to ensure that all employees are treated as consistently and fairly as possible throughout the city. The program has five major purposes:

(1)    To ensure that the employee knows what the problem is.

(2)    To communicate the superintendent’s/supervisor’s expectations are in order to correct the problem.

(3)    To provide appropriate penalties for improper work conduct.

(4)    To establish a period in which the employee is expected to have the problem corrected.

(5)    To provide a record of corrective action taken by the superintendent/supervisor.

(C)    There are four very basic and simple steps in the progressive discipline process; however, in cases of misconduct or repeated infractions, the process may be shortened and the superintendent/supervisory personnel in consultation with the Mayor’s office may move more directly to a later step in the process, including termination.

All action, be it remedial or disciplinary, should be taken within a reasonable time frame; it is strongly recommended that no more than three days (72 hours) elapse between the time the superintendent/supervisory personnel hears or has knowledge of the offense and the action taken.

(1)    Step one – oral warning. Oral warnings are appropriate for minor offenses. It is important that superintendents/supervisory personnel not overuse the oral warning for the same type of offense. No more than two oral warnings should be given to the same employee for the same offense.

(a)    The superintendent/supervisory personnel should make it very clear to the employee that the oral warning is the first step in the progressive disciplinary process. Even though it is called an oral warning it is very important to document the warning. The superintendent/supervisory personnel and the employee are required to sign the oral warning documentation. Oral warning documentation will permanently remain in the employee’s formal records in the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.

(2)    Step two – written warning. After an employee has received an oral warning, a subsequent offense should be addressed by a written reprimand as appropriate. Superintendents/supervisory personnel must review the draft of the written reprimand with the Mayor’s office.

(a)    The written warning must be given to the employee in person.

(b)    The written warning should describe as specifically as possible the situation which prompted the warning. Day, date, time, location, situation, those present.

(c)    Indicate why the action, behavior, and/or performance is unacceptable.

(d)    Explain in detail how the employee can correct the problem.

(e)    Outline a period for the employee to correct the problem.

(f)    State that if the behavior continues or other problems occur, additional corrective measures may be taken, which may result in termination of employment.

(g)    Written warnings permanently remain in the employee’s formal records in the Clerk- Treasurer’s office.

(3)    Step three – suspension. Suspension is the third step of the disciplinary procedure. It is intended to indicate to the employee the seriousness of the infraction and that the employee can reasonably expect that the next step is termination of employment.

(a)    The employee must be notified in writing of the suspension as soon as possible. The letter should outline the reason for the suspension. Suspensions are normally three to seven consecutive work days. Longer suspensions may be given because of the seriousness of the infraction. The employee should be warned that continuation of the behavior may result in termination of employment.

(b)    Normally suspensions are without pay, although if an investigation of events is necessary the employee may be suspended with pay, pending results of the investigation.

(4)    Step four – termination. Termination of employment is the culmination of the progressive discipline process or the penalty for very serious offenses. In all cases of termination, the superintendents/supervisory personnel must confer with the Mayor’s office.

(a)    All steps taken in the progressive discipline process must be documented and placed in the employee’s personnel file located in the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.

(b)    In all cases the employee has the right to dispute any disciplinary action and he/she may initiate the grievance procedure. However, the action taken stands until further notice.

All parties shall share equally the cost and expenses, if any, of the remediation process.

(D)    All employees terminating employment with the City of Rensselaer, either voluntary or involuntary, shall schedule an exit interview with the Clerk Treasurer’s office. Superintendents/supervisory personnel will notify the Clerk Treasurer’s office once the exit checklist is completed.

(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12) 


35.46 EXIT INTERVIEW.

(A)    Purpose. To ensure employees ending their employment with the city are made aware of benefit options that may be available to them, also to identify any potential personnel problems that might exist within the city’s work force, and, when possible, take necessary steps to correct situations and circumstances that contribute to these problems.

(B)    Policy. All individuals who are ending their employment with the city will be required to undergo an exit interview prior to the last day of their employment (preferably the last of employment). Those individuals who do not attend an exit interview will receive a certified letter from the Payroll Clerk advising available insurance options (COBRA).

(C)    During the exit interview the employee will have the opportunity to express their views on the operation of city government to include the effectiveness of their supervisor.

(D)    Supervisors are accountable to insure individuals separating from employment are aware of this policy.

(E)    Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).

(1)    This act requires employers to continue to offer coverage in their group health plan to certain former employees, retirees, spouses, and dependent children.

(2)    The length of continuation coverage offered depends on the qualifying event. QUALIFYING EVENTS are certain types of events that would cause, except for COBRA continuation coverage, an individual to lose health coverage. The type of qualifying event will determine who is entitled for continuation coverage under COBRA. For example, in the event a covered employee voluntarily or involuntarily terminates employment for reason other than gross misconduct or reduces the number of hours worked (which results in loss of coverage) the covered employee, spouse, and dependent children will be entitled to continue coverage in the group health plan for up to 18 months. A covered spouse and dependent child(ren) are eligible to continue coverage for up to 36 months in the event of divorce, legal separation, or death of the covered employee, or whenever the children no longer meet the requirement of a dependent child under the health plan.

(3)    Individuals will be required to pay the entire group rate premium by the first of each month.

(4)    Employees and their dependents must be notified of their rights to extend health plan coverage at the time they become plan participants and anytime a qualifying event occurs.

(5)    The required period of continued coverage may be terminated by the employer if the individual fails to make the required payments by the first of each month, becomes enrolled in another health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition, becomes entitled to Medicare, or if the employer’s group health plan is terminated.

(F)    The above information is a summary only and in no way intended to be legal advice. For further information, please contact the Clerk-Treasurer’s office.

(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12) 


35.47 KEEPING ACCOUNTS WITH CITY CURRENT.

(A)    All persons employed by the city and on the city payroll shall keep all accounts with the city in current standing, including but not limited to utility service.

(B)    If any such employee becomes indebted to the city, the employee shall, upon satisfying the Mayor and Council, make arrangements to pay any overdue accounts with the Utility Office. Arranged payments shall be made monthly until the overdue account(s) is paid in full. The Mayor and Council shall decide the minimum payment allowed and the time frame allowed to pay such overdue account(s) in full. In case of failure of such employee to meet his or her accounts, as herein provided, or in case of complaint being made, the employee shall be given a hearing before the Mayor, Council and Clerk-Treasurer. Upon his or her failure to show good reason why his or her account(s) has again become overdue, the employee shall be discharged from the service of the city and subject to the city’s means for collecting its losses.

(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12) 


35.48 SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

(A)    The city will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment. An employee suffers sexual harassment if he/she is asked to provide sexual favors in order to obtain employment, avoid discharge, or gain some other work-related benefit. The perpetrator of the harassment may be an employer or an employer’s agent, such as a supervisor, or an office holder.

(B)    There is also a second form of sexual harassment which occurs when an employee is subjected to a hostile or abusive working environment. In this kind of harassment, the offensive actions may be directly related to sexual matters, such as explicit sexual language, sexual joking, or sexual posters in the workplace; however, non-sexual harassment aimed at an employee solely because she is a female may also create a hostile environment.

(C)    Any employee who has a sexual harassment complaint will first register his or her complaint with the superintendent/supervisory personnel, unless the complaint involves the employee’s immediate superintendent/supervisor, at which time the sexual harassment complaint will first be registered with the Mayor. The superintendent/supervisory personnel shall then inform the Mayor of the complaint. An initial investigation by the Mayor and/or the City Attorney shall then be conducted promptly and thoroughly. All investigations shall be confidential and may include the following:

(1)    Warning;

(2)    Discipline;

(3)    Suspension without pay;

(4)    Termination of employee;

(5)    No action; or

(6)    Request for further investigation.

(D)    If either the alleged victim or alleged perpetrator is dissatisfied with the action taken by the Mayor, said individual may file a written complaint to the Mayor and Council, who may elect to hold a hearing. The decision of the Mayor and Council will be final.

(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12) 


35.49 WORKING HOURS.

(A)    To calculate compensable time, the Department of Labor uses the following formula to figure hours worked. Based on an hour, anything from 53 minutes before to seven minutes after the hour will be even time. Anytime from eight minutes to 22 minutes after the hour will be calculated at one-quarter of an hour. Anytime from 23 minutes to 37 minutes after the hour will be calculated at one-half of an hour and anytime from 38 minutes to 52 minutes will be calculated at three-quarters of an hour.

(B)    Superintendents/supervisory personnel have the authority to set working hours for employees of their respective departments (keeping in mind the 40-hour work week provision) for the purpose of accomplishing a specified task/job that calls for extensive working time beyond the normal (7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) Monday through Friday eight-hour work zone – i.e., a crew starting work at 6:00 a.m. and another crew starting at 10:00 a.m.

(C)    Employees are allotted two 15-minute breaks, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. All employees should take breaks at their respective locations or as determined by the superintendent or supervisory personnel.

(Ord. 16-2012, passed 6-11-12)


35.50 SAFETY AND WORKING CONDITIONS.

(A)    Establishment and maintenance of a safe work environment is the shared responsibility of the city and all employees. The city will take all reasonable steps to ensure a safe environment for employees, customers and visitors, and to ensure compliance with federal, state and local safety regulations.

(B)    Employees shall obey safety rules and exercise caution in all work activities, and shall immediately report any unsafe conditions to an elected official or their superintendent/supervisor. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made without fear of reprisal. All employees are expected to correct unsafe conditions as promptly as possible. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

They are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as and to the extent that they have been fully set forth at length herein.

(B)    All general house piping shall be of rigid construction. The pipe from the outlet of the meter shall be of iron pipe of not less than one inch inside diameter and shall protrude from the house wall or be securely fastened to the wall by means of suitable metal strap or clamp at a point not more than 18 inches from the outlet connection of the meter, and if extended along the outside wall shall be strapped to the wall at intervals sufficient to make the piping rigid throughout. In instances where piping protrudes from the wall, the opposite end shall be securely fastened so that pipe will not turn when fittings at the meter are put on.

(C)    The house manifold pipe shall terminate approximately six inches outside the building wall, approximately 15 inches to the right of the service line stub when facing the wall, and not less than six inches nor more than 24 inches above the ground with a one inch elbow turned down. The piping from the meter through and/or along the wall to the furnace or largest appliance shall constitute and hereinafter be called the “house pipe manifold.” The minimum size of one inch manifold will be used where the total hourly demand of a building or house is in excess of 400 cubic feet of gas per hour or less. Where the total hourly demand of a building or house is in excess of 400 cubic feet of gas per hour, the gas utility must be consulted for specifications for the house pipe manifold.

(D)    From any house pipe manifold, pipe to the various appliances shall be of the same dimension or larger than the fitting on the appliance where such appliance is designed and approved for natural gas, subject to the length of the run from the manifold. Where appliances are to be converted from liquefied petroleum gas, pipe from the manifold to the appliance shall be of such size as would be approved by the American Gas Association for natural gas appliances having the same BTU input rating.

(E)    From the house pipe manifold, any appliance pipe may be extended a maximum distance of 40 lineal feet unless specifically designed. For each 90 degree turn in the appliance pipe, three lineal feet shall be deducted from the maximum distance.

(F)    No connection will be made with any house type manifold that has not been tested for leakage or is not rigidly connected to the building.

(’73 Code, § 12-7) (Ord. 10-61, passed - -61; Am. Ord. 6-98, passed 4-13-98) 


52.09 EXTENSION OF GAS MAINS AND SERVICE SYSTEM.

(A)    The city shall extend service within the city limits as provided herein, when sufficient funds are available in excess of those required for the proper operation of the system. Extension of mains and service outside of the city limits shall be subject to approval of the council and shall be subject to all of the rules, regulations and provisions as provided herein or as may be amended by the Council.

(B)    The city shall, upon written request for service by a prospective customer or a group of prospective customers located in the same neighborhood, make, free of charge, an extension necessary to give service when the estimated total revenue, for a period of four years or as approved by the Council and/or its financial advisory, from the prospective customer or customers is approximately equal to the cost of the extension; provided that the patronage or demand will be of such permanency as to warrant the capital expenditure involved. Where such service requests are outside the city limits, said service and is subject to a 25% surcharge of the city’s base gas rates (refer to § 52.42 for further information).

(C)    If the extension required in order to furnish service at any point within the corporate limits of the municipality, or for any adjacent suburb of the municipality, is greater than the free extension specified herein, such an extension shall be made under the following conditions. The city shall require an interest free deposit of the cost of the extension above the free limit and shall in such case, for each additional customer connected to the extension within a period of eight years from the making of such extension, refund an amount by which four times the estimated annual revenue of the new customer exceeds the cost of connecting such new customer, but at no time shall the aggregate refund made to any customer exceed the original deposit of such customer. If the extension is of such length, and the prospective business which may be developed by it is so meager as to make it doubtful whether the business from the extension would ever pay a fair return on the investment involved in such extension, or in the case of real estate development enterprises with slight or no immediate demand for service, or in the case of industrial installation requiring extensive equipment with slight or irregular service, the facts shall be reported to the municipality for investigation and determination as to the reasonableness of such extension or installation and the conditions under which it shall be made.

(D)    In estimating the cost of an extension the estimate shall be based on the diameter of the pipe and type to be used; provided, however, the estimated cost to the customer shall not be based on a pipe diameter in excess of four inches, unless actual consumption estimated for the proposed customer or customers require a larger pipe.

(E)    The city shall not be required to make extensions as described in this section unless those to be served by such extension shall contract to use the service for at least four years. The city may require of the prospective customer on a proposed extension a satisfactory and reasonable guarantee that he will fulfill all the obligations made by him to the city.

(F)    Deposits made under the provisions of this section shall not exempt the applicant from the payment of all other charges required by the chapter.

(G)    Amounts received by the city for such extensions shall be deposited in the meter deposit fund and payments for refunds shall likewise be paid from such fund. Interest shall not be paid on deposits made for construction expenditures.

(e)    Class I users shall use the rates and charges hereto known as city rates.

(f)    Class III users shall use the rates and charges hereto known as rural rates.

(g)    In addition to the rates and charges under division (B)(1)(a)1 of this section, users connecting to the city’s west side sanitary sewer shall pay a debt service charge to assist in defraying the costs of furnishing such service. The charge shall be effective upon commencement of construction and continue until either December 31, 2021, or upon payoff of the bonds associated with the project, whichever is sooner. The debt service charge shall be determined as follows:

	 	Monthly Rate

	Rate per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU)	$75.30

An equivalent dwelling unit is a factor determined by the city based on the ratio of a customer’s maximum daily flow to the maximum daily flow for an average residential customer.

Until users connecting to the west side sanitary sewer are connected to the city’s municipal water utility, monthly water usage used to determine the monthly sewer bill as calculated in accordance with divisions (B)(1)(a)1 and 2 of this section shall be estimated by the city based on information provided by the user.

(2)    Class II and IV users.

(a)    Class II and Class IV users shall be those users who own and maintain their own collection system, do not make use of the city’s collection system, and whose billable flow is determined by a meter located at a point so as to record all of the Class II and Class IV users’ inflow and infiltration.

(b)    The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of flow generated by the user. For the purpose of billing and collecting the charges for sewage service, the meter shall be read monthly. In situations where it is impracticable for a meter to be read, the monthly reading may be estimated and reconciled with the next meter reading. The users shall be billed each month (or period equaling a month). The usage schedule on which the amount of said rates and charges shall be determined is as follows:

1.    Treatment rate per 1,000 gallons of usage per month:

	 	Phase I	Phase II	Phase III

	 	Effective 1/1/2014	Effective 1/1/2015	Effective 1/1/2016

53.42 CHARGES RELATED TO SPECIAL USE CONSIDERATIONS.

The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewage system and obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except as hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records to be consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that such quantities do not enter the sanitary sewage system.

(A)    In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building other than a single-family dwelling unit discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and the water used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rate or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.

(B)    In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city. In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for determination of sewage discharge.

(C)    In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be averaged for each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges shall apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real estate, or buildings served through the single water meter.

(D)    In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes, apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in each such case, billing shall be for a single service in the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall be in the amount shown below per month per dwelling unit served through the single water meter.

	Effective 1/1/2014	$14.55

	Effective 1/1/2015	$16.75

	Effective 1/1/2016	$18.95

In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home spaces available for rent plus any other dwelling units served through a meter. A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.

(E)    In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into the city’s sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses water in excess of 10,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.

53.43 CHARGES RELATED TO STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF WASTES.

In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges not only on the volume, but also on the strength and character of the stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat and dispose of. The city shall require the user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharged, either directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner, by such method, and at such times as the city may deem practicable in light of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge. The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times.

(A)    Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed ammonia in excess of 20 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid, or biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid. Additional charges for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:

(1)    Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids. There shall be an additional charge per pound of suspended solids for suspended solids received in excess of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid.

53.44 BILLING PROCEDURE.

Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the city in the manner provided by law and this subchapter.

(A)    The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and billed monthly. Annually, each user shall be notified of the portion of the total billing charged for operation, maintenance, and replacement for that user during the preceding year.

(B)    (1)    The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability in the event payment is not made as herein required.

    (2)    The owners of properties served which are occupied by a tenant or tenants shall have the right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided that such examination shall be made at the office at which such records are kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.

(C)    As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid by the fifteenth day following billing are hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount of the rates and charges shall thereupon attach hereto.

53.45 STUDIES TO DETERMINE FAIRNESS OF RATES.

(A)    In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users of user classes, the city shall cause a study to be made within a reasonable period of time following the first two years of operation, following the date on which the ordinance codified in this subchapter goes into effect. Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the cost associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works, and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements, and capital improvements to the wastewater treatment systems.

(B)    Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of time following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing this fairness, equity, and proportionality of the rates and charges conducted by officers or employees of the city or by a firm of certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees, certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall determine to be best under the circumstances. The city shall, upon completion of said study, revise and adjust the rates and charges as necessary in accordance therewith in order to maintain the proportionality and sufficiency of the rates.

(Ord. 12-93, passed 7-26-93; Am. Ord. 19-06, passed 10-23-06; Am. Ord. 7-07, passed 2-12-07; Am. Ord. 10-2008, passed 4-14-08; Am. Ord. 15-2011, passed 10-18-11; Ord. 12-2013, passed 12-9-2013)


53.46 AUTHORITY TO MAKE AND ENFORCE REGULATIONS.

The city may make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the safe, economical, and efficient management of the city’s sewage system, pumping stations, and sewage treatment works, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewage treatment works, the sewage collection system, and for the regulation, collection, and rebating and refunding of such rates and charges. The city is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the city’s sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the operation of the sewage treatment works of the city, or to require method affecting pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment standards included in the NPDES Permit issued to the sewage works or as contained in the EPA General Pretreatment Regulation, 40 CFR Part 403 and any amendments thereto, or the city’s pretreatment program plan.

53.47 CONNECTION CHARGE.

The owner of any residential lot, parcel of real estate, or building connecting to the sewage works shall, prior to being permitted to make a connection, pay a connection charge in the amount of $1,200 for each connection. The Council, acting as Utility Board, now finds such a connection charge to be reasonable and equitable pro rata cost of construction of a local or lateral sewer adequate to serve the property so connecting and the cost of providing a connection to the sewer, excavation, backfilling, pavement replacement, and installation of a sewer line from the sewer to the property line. All commercial, institutional, governmental, and industrial users will be charged actual time and material for the installation of a sewage tap, with the minimum fee being $1,200. The Utility Board now finds that such a method of charging said users is just and reasonable, as this class of users oftentimes has unique requirements not found with residential taps that result in greater overall cost to construct and connect the tap. Provided, however, no connection charge will be required of any customer connecting to a local or lateral sewer within 180 days of the date on which said sewer was available for connection. Connection charges will be imposed on any connection and on all connections made to future extensions of the system.

53.48 APPEAL PROCEDURE.

That the rules and regulations promulgated by the city, after approval by the Utility Board shall, among other things, provide for an appeal procedure whereby a user shall have the right to appeal a decision of the administrator of the sewage system and user charge system to the Utility Board, and that any decision concerning the sewage system or user charges of the Utility Board may be appealed to the circuit court of the county under appeal procedures provided for in the Indiana Administrative Adjudication Act.

53.49 AUTHORITY FOR SPECIAL RATE CONTRACTS.

The Board is hereby further authorized to enter into special rate contracts with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable reduction in cost to the sewage works can be determined, and such reduction shall be limited to such reduced costs.

(Ord. 12-93, passed 7-26-93; Am. Ord. 19-06, passed 10-23-06; Am. Ord. 7-07, passed 2-12-07; Am. Ord. 10-2008, passed 4-14-08; Ord. 12-2013, passed 12-9-2013)

91.01 GENERAL INFORMATION.

Weston Cemetery was platted in 1873 and has a burial history dating from 1841. It is owned by the city and is administered by a Sexton appointed by the Mayor and approved by the Common Council. All cemetery personnel are employees of the city. The roles and regulations regarding the cemetery are within the constraints of the ordinances of the city and laws set forth by the State of Indiana. Certain rules and regulations are specific to Weston Cemetery. These rules and regulations are designed for the protection of owners of interment rights as a group and they are intended, not as reserving, but rather as preventing the inconsiderate from taking unfair advantage of others. Their enforcement will help protect the cemetery and assist in creating and preserving its beauty. The Sexton (hereafter known as the management) and other Weston Cemetery personnel will be the instruments of the enforcement of these rules and regulations and they shall be enforced at the discretion of Weston Cemetery management. The Sexton is granted, by the state, within the cemetery and the immediate surrounding area which affects the proceedings within the cemetery, powers equal to a peace officer within the jurisdiction (I.C. 23-14-46-6). Weston Cemetery reserves the right to refuse admission to the cemetery, to refuse the use of any cemetery facilities at any time, and to eject any person whom the management may deem objectionable to the best interest of the cemetery. It is incumbent upon each visitor and lot owner to be familiar with the rules and regulations as applies to them. Weston Cemetery may not be held liable for any accident or injury sustained to any visitor as a result of a violation of the rules and regulations of the cemetery.

MASTER PLAN 


151.10 PURPOSE.

(A)    The purpose of this chapter is to establish a single unified code consisting of all plans, reports and ordinances that deal with the subject of planning and zoning, as a comprehensive guide to the future growth and development of the city and territory within the jurisdiction of the Plan Commission. (’73 Code, § 18-2)

(’73 Code, § 18-7)

(C)    The Common Council and all municipal boards, commissions and all other agencies of the city shall be guided by and give consideration to the general policy and pattern of development set out in the master plan prior to the authorization, construction, alteration or abandonment of any public installation required or necessitated in the interest of the physical development of the city and its jurisdictional area.

(Ord. 9-71, passed - -71)

The master plan consists of a plan entitled Comprehensive Land Use Plan, dated 1971, together with the provisions of the maps, charts, plans and ordinances which have heretofore or may hereafter be enacted concerning the following subjects: zoning, subdivision control, thoroughfares, central business district plan, enforcement, school, parking, parks, recreation and public areas, as well as other related subjects.

151.12 THOROUGHFARES.

(A)    A drawing entitled “Typical Thoroughfare Cross Sections, Rensselaer, Indiana,” which shows cross sections for streets as designated on the comprehensive use plan of the city, is hereby adopted. (’73 Code, § 18-4)

(B)    The thoroughfares are classified as to width and type in accordance with their function as a part of the thoroughfare system, and are designated as arterial, feeder, parkway and residential streets, as shown on the comprehensive land use plan. Such streets are to be provided with the right-of-way widths, shown on the thoroughfare plan as set out in comprehensive land use plan, and are to be improved as required by the city subdivision control regulations. (’73 Code, § 18-5)

(C)    Opening or widening of streets. Whenever a street designated on the thoroughfare plan is to be platted as a part of a subdivision of land, the right-of-way shall conform to the policies and specified designations and indications in the thoroughfare plan; provided that where a street borders a tract of land to be subdivided, the owner of such land shall be required to have such street measured at 90 degrees to the center line thereof.

(2)    Streets which follow irregular alignment, or indicate revised alignments or are not referenced to established lines, shall follow in a general manner the alignment shown on the thoroughfare plan. Their alignment shall be subject to detailed surveys which may be made by the Common Council or by the City Plan Commission or by other public agencies, or by the approval of the City Plan Commission prior to the acquisition of land or the filing of subdivision plans affecting such streets.

After adoption of the thoroughfare plan and this chapter, the Common Council shall be guided by and give consideration to the general policy and pattern of development set out in the thoroughfare plan in the authorization, construction, alteration or abandonment of public highways and structures.

(F)    Issuance of permits. In the case of permits authorized by the Common Council for the erection or alteration of structures and other improvements, the permit shall be issued only if the proposed street and thoroughfare rights-of-way, as set forth by this plan, will be protected from encroachment and, for planning and zoning purposes, the proposed street and thoroughfare right-of-way lines will be considered as the front line of lots and tracts bordering such streets and thoroughfares.

(Ord. 5-93, passed 4-12-93; Am. Ord. 24-02, passed 10-28-02) 


152.05 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT.

No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any “development” in the SFHA without first obtaining an improvement location permit from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall not issue an improvement location permit if the proposed “development” does not meet the requirements of this section.

(A)    The application for an improvement location permit shall be accompanied by the following:

(1)    A description of the proposed development;

(2)    Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams;

(3)    A legal description of the property site;

(4)    A site development plan showing existing and proposed development locations and existing and proposed land grades; and

(5)    Elevation of the top of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed development. Elevation should be in National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD). In either case the conversion formula should be included.

(B)    Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location permit, the Zoning Administrator shall determine if the site is located within an identified floodway, floodway fringe or within the floodplain where the limits of the floodway have not yet been determined.

(1)    (a) If the site is in an identified floodway the Zoning Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway.

(b)    Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit from the Natural Resources Commission is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, and the like, undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building.

(c)    No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until a permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit has been issued by the Natural Resources Commission, the Zoning Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in §§ 152.06 and 152.07 have been met. The improvement location permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit issued by the Natural Resources Commission.

(2)    If the site is located in an identified floodway fringe, then the Zoning Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit provided the provisions contained in §§ 152.07 and 152.09 have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the Flood Protection Grade (FPG).

(3)    (a) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Zoning Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.

(b)    No action shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator until either a permit for construction in the floodway or a letter of recommendation citing the 100 year flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Department of Natural Resources.

(c)    Once the Zoning Administrator has received the proper permit or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, an improvement location permit may be issued provided the conditions of the improvement location permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §§ 152.06 and 152.07 have been met.

(4)    (a) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Zoning Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, floodway fringe and 100 year elevation for the site.

(b)    Upon receipt, the Zoning Administrator may issue the local improvement location permit, provided the provisions contained in §§ 152.06 and 152.07 have been met.

152.06 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.

No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.

(A)    Within the floodway identified on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or engineering analysis, the following standards shall apply:

(1)    No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will cause any increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood; and

(2)    For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.

(B)    Within all SFHAs identified as A Zones (no 100 year flood elevation and/or floodway/floodway fringe delineation has been provided) the following standard shall apply:

(1)    The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood elevation more than one-tenth of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

(C)    Public Health Standards in all SFHAs:

(1)    No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection grade, unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed storage tank or building constructed according to the requirements of § 152.07.

(2)    New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground openings are located above the FPG, or those which are located below the FPG are watertight.

(Ord. 5-93, passed 4-12-93; Am. Ord. 24-02, passed 10-28-02)

such a permit or certificate in the event that same is erroneously issued or does not
comply with applicable laws and the Code of the City of Rensselaer, Indiana.
Furthermore, the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit, Certificate of Occupancy
or other permit or certificate in no way condones the violation of any restrictive covenants

22 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Administration
f) Non-Conforming Situations
The lawful use of a building or premise, existing at the time of the passage of this Ordinance, may
be continued although such use does not conform to all the provisions of this Ordinance, subject to
the following conditions:
1. May Be Extended. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout a building provided
the size of the structure is not increased.
2. Change with Ownership. A nonconforming use shall be changed to a conforming use at
the time ownership of the use or structure changes.
3. Use Cannot Be Changed to Nonconforming Use. Whenever a nonconforming use has
been changed to a conforming use or to a use permitted in a district of greater restrictions,
it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
4. No Building Erected on Nonconforming Use Premises. No building shall be erected upon
any premises devoted to a nonconforming use, except in conformance with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
5. Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use. In the event that a nonconforming use of any
building or premises is discontinued for a period of at least one (1) year, the use of the
same shall hereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located, and
provided further that any nonconforming dwelling which may be removed from a lot, shall
relocate on a lot in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
6. Damage to Nonconforming Use. If a building or other structure containing a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of fifty percent
(50%) or more of its replacement value at that time, the building or other structure can be
rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use and in compliance with the provisions
of the district in which it is located. In the event the damage or destruction is less than fifty
percent (50%) of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the building may
then be restored to its original condition and the occupancy or use of such building may
be continued which existed at the time of such partial destruction. It shall be the decision
of the Building Commissioner as to percentage determinations. In either event, restoration
or repair of the building or other structure must be started within a period of six (6) months
from the date of damage or destruction, and diligently pursued to completion within
eighteen (18) months from the date of damage or destruction.
Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Administration
23
7. Buildings May Be Made Safe. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building declared unsafe by proper
authority.
8. Nonconforming Use Resulting From Amendment. These provisions apply in the same
manner to a use which may become a nonconforming use as a result of an amendment to
this Ordinance.
9. Nonconforming Agricultural Use. An agricultural non-conforming use is subject to I.C. 36-
7-4-616 shall be maintained and operated in compliance with all:
a. State environmental and state health laws and rules, and
b. Requirements to which conforming agricultural use land is subject.
10. Nonconforming Use in FO Flood Overlay District. Any building, structure or use of land in
the FO Flood Overlay District which is not in conformance with this Ordinance constitutes
a nonconforming use. All applications to repair, extend or enlarge a nonconforming use in
the FO Flood Overlay District shall be forwarded to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment. All terms and conditions imposed by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources shall be incorporated into the issuance of any resulting
Improvement Location Permit or Building Permit issued by the Building Commissioner.
11. Nonconforming Lot Areas and Widths. A single-family dwelling may be located on any lot
in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted if the lot was a single parcel
included in a subdivision of record at the time of passage of this Ordinance, even though
the lot does not have the minimum lot width or the minimum lot area specified for the
district.

24 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Administration
a. A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues
to exist.
b. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Rensselaer from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
2. Violations in the SFHA or the FO Flood Overlay District. Failure to obtain an Improvement
Location Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or

Flood Overlay District in Section E, Overlay Zoning Districts.
a. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
b. The Building Commissioner shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
3. Complaints. Whenever a violation of this Ordinance occurs, or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint with the Building Commissioner.
4. Enforcement. If the Building Commissioner shall find that any of the provisions of this
Ordinance are being violated, he shall notify in writing the person responsible for the
violations, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to

d) Amendment (Rezoning)
Applications to amend the Zone Map, rezone or change the zoning classification of a parcel or
parcels of land shall comply with the requirements herein and the submittal procedures outlined in
Section B, Administration. Rezoning applications may be initiated by either the owner of the
subject property, or the City Council.
1. All actions by the Plan Commission in reviewing and making recommendations on a
rezoning application and by the City Council in approving or disapproving such application
shall be based in general upon the provisions of this Ordinance, and on the following
additional criteria:
a. That the existing zoning is inconsistent with the goals, objectives or policies of
the Comprehensive Plan.
b. That the land proposed for rezoning or adjacent land has changed, or is
changing, to a degree such that it is in the public interest and consistent with the
intent, purpose and provisions of this Ordinance to encourage different densities
or uses within the land in question.
c. That the proposed rezoning is needed to provide land for a demonstrated
community need or service and such rezoning will be consistent with the goals,
objectives and policies contained within the Comprehensive Plan.
d. That the existing zone classification currently recorded on the Zone Map is in
error.
e. That the change of zone is in conformance, or will bring the property into
conformance, with the Comprehensive Plan goals, objectives and policies, and
other related policies or plans for the area.
30 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Zone Map
f. That the proposed change of zone is compatible with the surrounding area and
there will be minimal adverse impacts considering the benefits to be derived.
g. That there will be social, recreational, physical and/or economic benefits to the
community derived by the change of zone.
h. That adequate infrastructure/facilities are available to serve the type of uses
allowed by the change of zone, or that the applicant will upgrade and provide
such where they do not exist or are under capacity.
i. That the proposed rezoning will not adversely affect public health, safety or
welfare by creating excessive traffic congestion, creating drainage problems, or
seriously reducing light and air to adjacent properties.
j. That the rezoning will not create an isolated or spot zone district unrelated to
adjacent or nearby areas.
k. That the applicant shall carry the burden of demonstrating that the land in
question should be rezoned and that the advantages resulting from rezoning
would outweigh any disadvantages that would result. Nothing contained herein
shall, however, be construed as limiting in any way the authority of the City
Council to rezone any land within the City’s jurisdiction or otherwise amend the
Zone Map for any reason consistent with health, welfare or safety of citizens. The
final decision on a change of zone expressly rests in the exercise of the
discretion of the City Council. All applicants are advised there is no right to a
change of zone.
2. If an applicant for a residential subdivision of land, as set forth in Chapter 22, Revised
Subdivision Code, proposed to be located in an area covered by an A-1 District, can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Plan Commission that such land is actually located
in an area having primarily Group III and/or Group IV Soils (in accordance with the criteria
and findings in the soil survey prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service in cooperation with the Purdue Experimental
Station and the Jasper County Soil and Water Conservation District), the Plan
Commission may then initiate a Zone Map amendment on its own motion in order to
cause the area proposed to be subdivided to be reclassified to the A-2 District, provided
following requirements have been met by the applicant:
Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance

l) Planned Unit Development (PUD)
The Planned Unit Development District is intended to provide more development flexibility than is
possible through the application of customary zoning regulations. In recognition of both the rapid
changes in design and technology in the building industry and new demands in the housing and
commercial markets, it is deemed necessary to meet those changes in a manner that will be
consistent with the best interests of the City. A Planned Unit Development should be designed to
produce an environment of stable and desirable character in keeping with the principles of good
community design, with standards for open space, street patterns, parking and site amenities
adequate for the occupancy proposed.
1. Permitted uses in a Planned Unit Development may include:
a. Dwelling units in detached, semi- detached, attached or multi-storied structures
or any combination thereof;
b. Non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and business or
enclosed industrial character; or
c. Non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and business or
enclosed industrial character, which uses are an integral part of a residential
development logically oriented to and coordinated with the total Planned Unit
Development. Such uses shall be planned and gauged primarily for the service
and convenience of the anticipated population of the planned unit development.
2. Approval a Planned Unit Development is a two step process: Step 1 involves approval of
a Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan; Step 2 involves approval of a Detailed
Planned Unit Development Plan.
a. Where a platting, re-platting or vacation of streets within all or a portion of the
land involved is contemplated, the Commission shall handle such matters in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 22, Revised Subdivision Control
Code.
b. A Preliminary Plat and a Final Plat may be prepared concurrently with either a
Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan or a Detailed Planned Unit
Development Plan, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 22, Revised
Subdivision Control Code.
58 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Base Zone Districts
3. Approval of a Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan shall be subject to the following
procedures:
a. Upon a petition of the owners of property of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
area involved in the application, or upon a petition initiated by the Commission, a
preliminary plan for any area proposed for development as a Planned Unit
Development shall be first presented to the Building Commissioner. Three (3)
copies of a preliminary plan of the proposed development, containing the
following information, shall be submitted for review:
i. Proposed dimensioned layout to scale, not to exceed one hundred
(100) feet equal one (1) inch.
ii. Proposed locations, amounts and types of non-residential uses within
the area proposed to be developed.
iii. Proposed plan for handling vehicular traffic, parking, sewage disposal,
drainage, water supply, site perimeter treatment and other pertinent
development features.
iv. The preliminary plan may be an approximate drawing, but it shall
include any other graphic mediums which will explain the features to be
contained within the development of engineering feasibility.
v. If the Planned Unit Development is to supersede an original plat or
subdivision being vacated, the original plat shall be shown by dotted
lines in relationship to the lines of the new plan, the new plan being
clearly shown in solid lines.
vi. The plan shall show the boundary lines of adjacent subdivided and unsubdivided
land and the existing zoning of the area proposed to be
developed, as well as the land adjacent thereto. In the case of a petition
by owners, the plan shall also show which property within the area
proposed for development is owned by such owners.
vii. An enumeration of covenants, in general terms, proposed to be made a
part of the Planned Unit Development.
viii. A statement expressing the order and estimated time of development.
Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Base Zone Districts
59
b. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the petition for preliminary plan approval, the
Building Commissioner shall forward the application to the Technical Review
Committee for their examination and report.
c. Within five (5) days after receipt of the Technical Review Committee report, the
Building Commissioner shall consult with the petitioner regarding the preliminary
plan. After such consultation, the petitioner may make modifications to the
application which are deemed appropriate.
d. Application for approval of the preliminary plan for the Planned Unit Development
shall then be submitted to the Commission along with a recommendation from
the Building Commissioner, accompanied by six (6) copies of the preliminary
plan (with modifications, if any) and any other desired supporting documents.
e. The preliminary plan for the Planned Unit Development shall be considered at a
regular meeting of the Commission as a petition for amendment of the Zone Map
and subject to the procedures applicable thereto. The Commission may approve
the preliminary plan as amended, or disapprove the plan. The Commission may
impose any reasonable conditions upon its approval, including the recording of
covenants. If approved, the preliminary plan with amendments, if any, shall be
stamped "Approved Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan" and be signed
by the president and secretary of the Commission, and one (1) copy shall be
permanently retained in the office of the Commission.
f. The Approved Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan shall then be certified
to the City Council for adoption as a Planned Unit Development (PUD) District
pursuant to the regulations governing amendment of the Zone Map.
4. Approval of a Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan shall be subject to the following
procedures:
a. Before any development takes place, the Commission shall approve a Detailed
Planned Unit Development Plan specifying the exact location, composition, and
general engineering features of all lots, drainage, sewage, water supply facilities,
recreational facilities, site perimeter treatment and other pertinent site
development features including general locations and features of proposed
buildings. Such approval shall be conditional upon a finding by the Commission
that the Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan is consistent with the approved
Preliminary Planned Unit Development Plan. The approved Detailed Planned
Unit Development Plan shall be stamped "Approved Detailed Planned Unit
60 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Base Zone Districts
Development Plan" and be signed by the President of the Commission, and one
(1) copy shall be permanently retained in the office of the Commission.
b. Approval of a Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan shall be obtained within
one (1) year after adoption by the City Council, unless the Commission, upon
proper application, for good cause shown, grants an extension of time for such
period as it deems is in the public interest; provided, however, only the
"Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan" shall be required within the
said one (1) year period, and a Final Plat for recording purposes of all or an
appropriate part of the Planned Unit Development may be undertaken in sections
or phases at a later time.
c. A refusal by the Commission to approve a Detailed Planned Unit Development
Plan shall not be construed as a denial, and any such refusal shall not operate
as a limitation on the right of the petitioner to continue to seek approval nor shall
it impair the right of the petitioner to obtain an extension of time for approval.
d. In the event that approval of a Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan is not
obtained with the one (1) year period or an approved extension of time, the
Commission shall initiate an amendment of the Zone Map so that the land will be
zoned into the category or categories it held before being reclassified as a PUD
District.
e. An Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan and modifications thereof shall be
recorded in the Office of the Jasper County Recorder by the applicant.
f. Approval of a Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan shall expire after a period
of three (3) years from its date of its approval, unless the development is fifty
percent (50%) completed in terms of public improvements, including streets,
parks, walkways and utility installations, in which instance an extension of time
may be granted by the Commission not to exceed two (2) successive periods of
two (2) years each.
g. Under the abandonment of a development authorized under this subsection
(abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have
been made pursuant to the Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan for twentyfour
(24) consecutive months, or under the expiration of seven (7) years from the
approval by the Commission of a Detailed Unit Development Plan for a
development which construction has been initiated yet not completed, or the
expiration of an extension granted by the Commission), the Commission shall
initiate an amendment to the Revised Zoning Ordinance so that the land will be
Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Base Zone Districts
61
zoned (or reclassified) into a category or categories which most nearly
approximate its then existing use or such other zoning category or categories
which it deems appropriate.
h. The Commission shall not initiate any amendment to the Zone Map concerning
property involved in a Planned Unit Development District as long as the
development is in conformity with an approved Detailed Planned Unit
Development Plan and proceeding in the time requirements imposed herein.
5. Development associated with an Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan shall
be subject to the following procedures:
a. No Improvement Location Permit shall be issued in a Planned Unit Development
unless an Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan has been
recorded.
b. All development shall be in conformity with the Approved Detailed Planned Unit
Development Plan. In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Commission shall take
cognizance of any material deviations from the Approved Detailed Planned Unit
Development Plan and take appropriate enforcement action.
c. The Commission may allow the petitioner to develop property associated with an
Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan in phases. If such phasing is
permitted, the Commission may allow the petitioner to submit partial detailed site
plans which correspond to the phases involved. Such partial detailed site plans,
when approved, shall be treated in the same manner as approved detailed site
plans for an entire Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan.
d. No construction or installation work shall be done on any public improvements
associated with an Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development Plan until
satisfactory plans and specifications therefore have been approved by the City
Engineer in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 22, Revised Subdivision
Control Code, and the petitioner has, at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance,
notified the Building Commissioner of his intention to begin such work, in order
that inspections may be made as the work progresses.
e. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued in a Planned Unit Development
unless the Approved Detailed Unit Development Plan, with modifications, if any,
is adhered to, all in compliance with the purposes of this Ordinance and other
applicable City ordinances.
62 Chapter 28: Rensselaer Zoning Ordinance
Base Zone Districts
6. Covenants shall be required by the Commission as an ingredient for stability and longevity
of the Planned Unit Development, and shall set forth, in detail, provisions for the
ownership and maintenance of facilities held in common so as to reasonably insure their
continuity and conservation.
a. Said covenant provisions shall include special remedies in the event facilities
held in common are permitted to deteriorate or are not maintained in a condition
consistent with the best interests of the City, and in such event the City shall take
those remedial steps provided for in such provisions.
b. The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any reasonable
public or semi-public purpose, including, but not limited to, the allocation of land
by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks, schools, recreational facilities,
and other public and semi-public purposes whenever necessary in conformity
with the Comprehensive Plan of current adoption. Such covenants shall provide
that if a governmental unit or agency thereof does not proceed with acquisition of
the allocated land within a specified period of time, the covenants shall
automatically terminate. If such termination occurs, the petitioner shall then
submit for approval by the Commission a modified Detailed Planned Unit
Development Plan for such land consistent with the Approved Preliminary
Planned Unit Development Plan.
c. The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any other
reasonable purpose, including, but not limited to, imposing standards for
development of property in a Planned Unit Development. Such development
standards may include, but are not limited to, requirements as to the following:
i. Lot area, width and coverage;
ii. Floor area;
iii. Ratios of floor space to land area;
iv. Area in which structures may be built (building area), including areas for
cluster type residential development without lot lines;

procedures of platting pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 22, Revised Subdivision
Control Code.
8. Adequate provision shall be made for a private organization with direct responsibility to,
and control by, the property owners involved to provide for the operation and maintenance
of all common facilities including private streets jointly shared by such property owners if
such facilities are a part of the Planned Unit Development, and, in such instance, legal
assurance shall be provided which shows that the private organization is self-perpetuating
and adequately funded to accomplish its purposes.
a. Common facilities which are not dedicated to the public shall be maintained to
standards assuring continuous and adequate maintenance at a reasonable and
non-discriminatory rate of charge to the beneficiaries thereof. Common facilities
not dedicated to the public shall be operated and maintained at no expense to
any governmental unit.

a) Airport Overlay (AO)
The Airport Overlay (AO) District is intended to encourage the harmonious arrangement and
development of land uses in and around Jasper County Airport. Establishment of an Airport
Overlay District, however, does not imply that areas outside of the Airport Overlay District will be
totally free from airport and aircraft related hazards nor that all hazards within the Airport Overlay
District will be completely mitigated. Establishment of the Airport Overlay District shall not create a
liability on the part of or cause any action against the City of Rensselaer or any officer, employee or
contractor thereof for any damages that may result directly or indirectly from reliance on the
provisions contained herein.
1. The regulations and standards contained herein shall apply to all land within the Airport
Overlay District. This district will serve as an overlay district that applies supplementary
regulations in addition to all other applicable underlying zone district regulations. In the
case of conflicting standards and requirements, the more stringent standards and

letter of recommendation approving the proposed development, an
Improvement Location Permit may be issued provided the conditions of
the Improvement Location Permit are not less restrictive than the
conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
and the provisions contained in this Ordinance have been met.
viii. If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway
and floodway fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage
area upstream of the site is less than one (1) square mile, the Building
Commissioner shall require the applicant to provide an engineering
analysis showing the limits of the floodway, floodway fringe and one
hundred (100) year elevation for the site. Upon receipt of the
engineering analysis, the Building Commissioner may issue the
Improvement Location Permit, provided the provisions of this Ordinance
have been met.

F. District Uses
a) Permitted Uses
Permitted uses are those uses specifically allowed in one or more of the base zone districts or
overlay zone districts without the necessity to show need for their location. Permitted uses are
allowed as a matter of right and generally without the need for special authorization, further
application or administrative review, unless otherwise required by the Building Commissioner.
b) Conditional Uses
Conditional uses are land uses that have potential for causing adverse impacts on other uses
because of such factors as location, method of operation, scale or intensity of activity, or traffic
generated. Because of their unusual or special characteristics, conditional uses require review and
evaluation so that they may be located properly with respect to their effects on surrounding
properties and the City at large. Conditional uses may be permitted subject to such conditions and
limitations as may be prescribed. The intent is to ensure that the location and operation of the
conditional use is in accordance with the development objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and
will not be detrimental to other uses or properties. Where conditions cannot be devised to achieve
these objectives, or it is not possible to mitigate adverse impacts, applications for a conditional use
will not be approved.
1. The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby authorized to allow uses designated in each
zoning district as conditional uses subject to the requirements in Section B, Administration
and any additional requirements specified for a particular use in Section H, Supplemental
Use Standards.
2. A conditional use shall conform to all development standards of the applicable zoning
district.
3. A conditional use shall conform to all conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Such conditions may include any reasonable site, development, operational and
performance standards, requirements and restrictions deemed necessary.

complying with the requirements of this Ordinance. Whenever any movable or unattached
sign is installed or maintained in violation of this Ordinance, said sign may be removed by
action of the Building Commissioner after due notice is given to the person in interest.

Commissioner for thirty (30) days, during which they may be recovered by the owner only
upon payment to the applicable jurisdiction for costs of removal and storage. If not
recovered within the thirty (30) day period, the sign and supporting structure shall be
declared abandoned and title shall vest with the applicable jurisdiction. The costs of
removal and storage (up to thirty [30] days) may be billed to the owner. If not paid, the
