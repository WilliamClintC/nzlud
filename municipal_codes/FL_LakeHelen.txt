These regulations will aid in providing for increased public safety in traffic, transportation, vehicular parking, parks, commercial buildings, public buildings, residential housing, water services, storm drainage, emergency preparedness and other public requirements and interests. The intent is to help lessen traffic and building congestion in new developments, disorder, and dangers that occur in unplanned and unregulated development; prevent overcrowding and overdevelopment on the land and an undue concentration of population; provide for a more equitable and just land-use pattern; and, provide more reasonable and serviceable means and methods of safeguarding the economic structure and improving the overall aesthetics and the residential quality of life in the City of Lake Helen.

No person shall use, occupy, establish, authorize or permit the use, occupancy or subdivision of any land or buildings under their control except in accordance with all applicable provisions of these regulations.

1.07.02 - Exceptions. 
1.  Previously issued and applied for building/development permits. The provisions of these Land Development Code (LDC) regulations and any amendments thereto will not affect the validity of any lawful application or issued and effective building/development permit applied for in good faith or issued prior to the date of these adopted regulations (which shall be February 1, 2018) and if:

    Development techniques such as clustering are to be used to ensure the protection of the habitats. The preservation of wildlife corridors within developments which connect to other protected wildlife habitats shall be required. 
7.10.00 - Operational Standard: Noise, Vibrations, Odors, Fumes. 
    The purpose of this section is to provide appropriate standards for the objective measurement of potential nuisances within the City: to ensure that the community is protected by requiring methods to control or eliminate the hazards and nuisances; to protect potential uses from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on perceived harm or past reputation. 
    These standards shall apply to all uses and operations within the City of Lake Helen. 
7.10.01 - Noise. 
    No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land use category in the table below: 
Table 7A Sound Levels by Receiving Land Use 
Receiving Land Use Category Time Sound Level Limit 
dBA Residential 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. 61 10:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. 55 Commercial 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. 66 10:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. 60  
    These levels may not be exceeded for more than three (3) cumulative minutes out of any continuous sixty (60) minute period. 
7.10.02 - Noise Level Limits in dBA. 
    The following limits are in effect which if exceeded will have a high probability of producing permanent hearing loss in anyone in the area where the noise levels are being exceeded. No noise shall be permitted within the City which exceeds these limits. 
Table 7B Permissible Noise Exposures 
Duration per day, continuous hours Noise Level-dBA 8 90 6 92 4 95 3 97 2 100 11/2 102 1 105 1/2 110 1/4 or less 115  
    When the daily noise exposure is composed of two (2) or more periods of noise exposure at different levels, their combined effect should be considered, rather than the individual effect of each. If the sum of the following fractions: C1/T1 + C2/T2 ...Cn/Tn exceeds unity, then, the mixed exposure should be considered to exceed the noise level limit value. Cn indicates the total time of exposure at a specified noise level, and Tn indicates the total time of exposure permitted at that level.

The amount of land cleared shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish a permitted development or agricultural activity. Clear cutting a development site shall not be permitted. For phased development projects, clearing shall only be allowed for the phase approved and ready for development, and only for those areas outlined above. For subdivisions, land clearing shall be for infrastructure areas only. Individual lots within subdivisions shall be only cleared at the time of approval of a Building Permit. Where infrastructure cannot be constructed without the removal of trees within an individual lot, city permission shall be granted for the necessary tree removal on the lot on a tree by tree basis. 
    A land clearing permit is required for the removal of any underbrush other than that directly associated with a developed single-family home site or construction activities associated with a building permit already in effect, and land clearing necessary for surveying. 
8.06.00 - Appeal of Tree Preservation Decisions. 
    Any person with a grievance as to a tree(s) being required to be preserved; the number of trees being required as replacement trees; tree recompense fees; or any other issues with the administration of tree preservation may request an appeal and/or interpretation by the City Commission as outlined in Article 15. 
8.07.00 - Landscaping Regulations. 
8.07.01 - Landscaping Regulations. 
    It is the intent of the City of Lake Helen City Commission to promote the health, safety, and welfare for both current and future residents and visitors by establishing minimum standards for the installation and continued maintenance of landscaping within the City of Lake Helen, Florida. 
    The importance of the installation and maintenance of landscaping: 
1.  Improves the aesthetic appearance of residential and commercial properties through the harmonizing of the built environment; 
2.  Improves environmental quality through the following scientifically-recognized benefits: 
a.  Improving air and water quality through such recognized processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; 
b.  Maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water and riverine management, as well as aquifer recharge; 
c.  Reducing and reversing air, noise, and other pollutants through the biological filtering capacities of trees and flora; 
d.  Conserving energy through the creation of shade by reducing the heating of buildings and paved surfaces; and 
e.  Reducing the temperature of the microclimate though the process of evapotranspiration; 
3.  Maintains and increases the value of land, thus becoming a capital asset; 
4.  Provides direct and important physical and psychological benefits to humans through the reduction of noise and glare and the softening of the physiological impacts of urban development. 
8.07.02 - Relationship to Comprehensive Plan. 
    These regulations shall work towards implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the Conservation element of the City of Lake Helen Comprehensive Plan. 
    City of Lake Helen Comprehensive Plan, Conservation Element. 
1.  Policy V1.2.10. Florida Friendly Landscaping. The City shall encourage the use and application of Florida-Friendly Landscaping and Florida-Friendly Yard practices to improve water quality and reduce the consumptive use of water.

7.  Pesticides: It shall be the goal of each landscape plan to establish an Integrated Pest Management approach and reduce or eliminate the need for pesticide application. 
8.07.11 - Required Landscaping in Off-street Parking Areas. 
    Landscaping is required in off-street parking areas to promote safe and efficient use of the facilities, conserve energy through the cooling effect of trees and vegetation and provide buffers between vehicular use areas so that potential negative impacts do not adversely affect activity in another area. Landscaping also aids in parking circulation by better directing access to proper ingress and egress points, as well as the internal movement of vehicles and pedestrians to desired areas. 
    All off-street parking areas, except those which serve single-family and duplex structures, shall meet the following landscape requirements, along with all of the general landscape requirements outlined in this article. It is the intent of this section to promote vehicular and pedestrian safety; limit physical site access to established points of ingress and egress; delineate and buffer the bounds of abutting vehicular use areas so that distractions of movement, noise and glare from one area do not adversely affect the activity in another area; break up large expanses of pavement; and to reduce heat island effect within the vehicular use areas of a site. 
    All off-street parking lots with ten (10) or more required parking spaces and vehicular use areas (access driveways, service drives, and loading areas) are required to include landscaping. Required parking lot landscaping shall be in addition to requirements for protection of existing trees, except where preserved trees are part of required landscaping buffers. 
1.  A permit shall be required for development or redevelopment of any off-street parking area to serve an existing use, when it is not part of the original development or redevelopment building permit. 
2.  Parking areas that abut a public right-of-way shall include a minimum ten-foot wide landscaped buffer on the perimeter of the parking area that abuts any private or public street. 
3.  A minimum of one (1) landscaped island shall be provided for every ten (10) parking spaces. Each island shall contain a minimum of one shade (1) tree. Landscaped islands shall be a minimum of fifty (50) square feet in area. 
4.  Where a sidewalk is not provided, a minimum of five feet (5') of landscaping, consisting primarily of shrubbery, shall be provided along the front of any building which abuts a parking area. 
5.  Landscape areas shall have a minimum of two (2) living plant materials other than trees. The total of all landscape areas on a site shall include a minimum of three (3) living plant materials other than trees. 
6.  Interior planting areas shall be located to effectively accommodate stormwater runoff, as well as to provide shade in large expanses of paved areas. Use of swales, vegetated filter strips, and bioretention areas (rain gardens) shall be incorporated into the overall stormwater plan, grading plan, and landscape strategy for the entire parking area. Plant species should be selected based on their ability to tolerate urban stresses such as expected pollutant loadings, highly variable soil moisture conditions, ponding water fluctuations, and Soil pH and texture. 
7.  All right-of-way areas as well as any existing landscaping disturbed by construction shall be restored in a manner approved by the City. 
8.  If stabilized grass parking is utilized, the parking spaces shall be delineated with parking stops. 
9.  Landscape buffers shall be provided between the parking area and any residentially zoned properties which abut the parking area. 
10.  All landscaped areas serving the parking area shall be protected from encroachment by a barrier such as curbs, wheel stops, or similar devices. 
a)  Curbs shall be designed to allow percolation of water to the root systems of the plants. Where existing trees are preserved, tree wells, tree islands, or a continuous curb shall be installed to protect the trunk and root system from damage. A drainage system shall be provided within the area defined by the drip line of the tree(s). 
b)  Vehicle stops or other design features shall be used to prevent parked vehicles from overhanging more than two (2) feet into any landscape area. 
11.  All parking spaces adjacent to any structures shall be separated from that structure by a minimum five-foot wide landscape buffer. The landscape buffer may contain walkways, but in no instance shall the landscaped area within the buffer be less than fifty percent (50%) of the total buffer area. 
    In order to allow for flexibility and creativity in design standards, hedges may be replaced or interrupted in areas which provide for a decorative wall and berms and other creative landscape features, and landscape materials may be clustered so long as the parking area remains screened from the public right-of-way and adjacent private property. 
8.07.12 - Required Perimeter Landscaping in Off-street Parking Areas. 
    A landscaped area not less than ten (10) feet in width, exclusive of impervious area, using vertical layering of landscape materials shall be located around the perimeter of the parking lot in order to provide visual screening from the right-of-way or adjoining properties. Perimeter landscape area requirements shall not apply to shared vehicular access areas or to the portion of the perimeter areas where physical interconnections exist. When perimeter landscape areas are required on adjacent properties, the owners of such adjacent properties may agree to the installation of only one such landscape area on the adjacent boundary, as long as such agreement is binding on both property owners and their successors in the interest and is approved as part of the site plan review process. 
A.  An access, not exceeding four feet (4') in width, may be provided through the buffer to an adjacent sidewalk, public street, or sidewalk. 
B.  Trees within the perimeter landscaped area shall be determined using a ratio of one (1) tree for each twenty (20) linear feet of required landscape perimeter area, or major portion thereof, with no less than fifty percent (50%) of said trees being shade trees. Creative design and spacing is encouraged. Where creative design or spacing is utilized, other features such as fencing, walls, berms, or similar structures may be required to fill visual gaps and meet opacity standards. 
C.  A visual screen is required within perimeter landscape areas, running the entire length of such areas excluding areas of ingress and egress. The visual screen may be provided using: 
a.  Shrubs or Ornamental Grasses. Shrubs or Ornamental Grasses shall be spaced a minimum of three feet to a maximum of six feet on center dependent on the inherent growth of the species. Creative design and spacing is encouraged. 
b.  Contoured berms or embankments. Contoured berms or embankments shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches in height, measured from the adjacent parking surface level, at the time of planting and landscaped appropriately. 
c.  Plant material must be non-deciduous for full year round screening. 
d.  Where the adjacent right-of-way meets an on-site road right-of-way or driveway, an area bounded by the first thirty (30) feet along each right-of-way line or driveway, projected where rounded and a diagonal line extending across the property and connecting the ends of such thirty (30) foot lines shall be provided, where visual obstructions from trees, plants, shrubs, and other landscaping materials of between three (3) and six (6) feet in height shall be prohibited. 
e.  Perimeter landscaping for parking lots along road rights-of-way shall provide opacity of seventy percent (70%). 
8.07.13 - Sign Landscaping. 
    All monument (ground) signs shall have shrubbery or flowers planted around the perimeter of the sign. Signs shall be located so as to provide both adequate visibility from the public rights-of-way utilizing visibility triangles and to preserve protected trees. 
    If a freestanding sign cannot be shifted to allow the required room for perimeter plantings between the sign and the parking area without obscuring visibility to the sign, then the City shall allow a five (5) foot radius from the base of the freestanding sign in which lower accent plantings are allowed in lieu of perimeter plantings. 
8.07.14 - Mechanical Equipment Screening Plantings. 
    Structures such as dumpster enclosures, mechanical equipment, backflow preventers, wells, pumps, tanks, buffer walls, HVAC units, transformers, lift stations, utility cabinets, electrical panels, or cable television equipment shall be wholly enclosed within either a natural or manmade enclosure on three (3) sides, with an opaque gate on the access side, so as not to interfere with the ability to access said equipment and/or empty the dumpster. Said access gate shall remain closed when not in use. Screening shall, at a minimum, be at the same height as the equipment to be screened. Structural screening shall be architecturally integrated into the overall project design and shall be compatible, in terms of style, exterior construction materials, colors, and finish with the principle and accessory building(s).

5.  The consumer shall bear all expense of installing, testing and maintaining the protective devices required by this article to ensure proper operation on a continuing basis. Installation, testing and maintenance of protective devices shall be conducted by certified personnel approved by the city's department of public works.

The consumer shall keep records on his testing, maintenance and repair activities related to cross-connection control and shall make these records available upon request. Copies of all testing, maintenance and repair records shall be sent to the city's department of public works immediately after the work is performed. 
6.  Section 9.07 does not supersede the Florida Building Code, the Florida State Department of Health Guidelines or any city ordinance but is supplementary to them; where conflicts exist, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
7.  Any person or customer found guilty of violating any of the provisions of section 9.07 or any written order of the City or pursuance thereof shall be subject to the provisions of Article 15.

    The Assessments authorized herein shall constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
    The Assessments imposed pursuant to this Article will be imposed by the City Commission, not the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector. Any activity of the Property Appraiser or Tax Collector under the provisions of this Article shall be construed solely as ministerial. 
9.09.01 - Authority and Purpose. 
    The City Commission is hereby authorized to impose Assessments against property located within an Assessment Area to fund Capital Improvements or Essential Services. The Assessment shall be computed in a manner that fairly and reasonably apportions the Capital Costs or Service Costs among the parcels of property within an Assessment Area, based upon objectively determinable Assessment Units related to the value, use or physical characteristics of the property. 
9.09.02 - Creation of Assessment Areas. 
1.  The City Commission is hereby authorized to create Assessment Areas by resolution. Each Assessment Area shall encompass only that property specially benefited by the Capital Improvements or Essential Services proposed for funding from the proceeds of Assessments to be imposed therein. Either the Initial Assessment Resolution proposing an Assessment Area or the Final Assessment Resolution creating an Assessment Area shall include brief descriptions of the Capital Improvements or Essential Services proposed for such area, a description of the property to be included within the Assessment Area, and specific legislative findings that recognize the special benefit to be provided by each proposed Capital Improvement or Essential Service to property within the Assessment Area. Properties in any Assessment Area need not be adjacent or contiguous to any other property in an Assessment Area. 
2.  At its option, the City Commission may establish a process pursuant to which the owners of property may petition for creation of an Assessment Area to fund Capital Improvements and Essential Services. Notwithstanding any petition process established pursuant to this section, the City Commission shall retain the authority to create Assessment Areas without a landowner petition. 
9.09.03 - Initial Assessment Resolution. 
    The initial proceeding for imposition of an Assessment shall be the City Commission's adoption of an Initial Assessment Resolution. The Initial Assessment Resolution shall:

B.  describe the Capital Improvements or Essential Services proposed for funding from proceeds of the Assessments; 
C.  estimate the Service Cost or Capital Cost; 
D.  establish a Maximum Assessment Rate if desired by the City Commission;

F.  include specific legislative findings that recognize the equity provided by the apportionment methodology; 
G.  schedule a public hearing at a meeting of the City Commission, which meeting shall be a regular, adjourned or special meeting, at which to hear objections of all interested persons and to consider adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution and approval of the Assessment Roll; and 
H.  direct the Assessment Coordinator to (1) prepare the Assessment Roll pursuant to Section 9.09.04 hereof, (2) publish the notice required by Section 9.09.05 hereof, and (3) mail the notice required by Section 9.09.06 hereof using information then available from the Property Appraiser. 
9.09.04 - Assessment Roll. 
A.  The Assessment Coordinator shall prepare a preliminary Assessment Roll that contains the following information: 
1.  a summary description of each parcel of property (conforming to the description contained on the Tax Roll) subject to the Assessment; 
2.  the name of the owner of record of each parcel, as shown on the Tax Roll; 
3.  the number of Assessment Units attributable to each parcel; 
4.  if applicable, the estimated maximum annual Assessment to become due in any Fiscal Year for each Assessment Unit; and 
5.  if applicable, the estimated maximum annual Assessment to become due in any Fiscal Year for each parcel. 
B.  Copies of the Initial Assessment Resolution and the preliminary Assessment Roll shall be on file in the office of the Assessment Coordinator and open to public inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the Assessment Roll be in printed form if the amount of the Assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use of a computer terminal or otherwise accessible through the internet or similar data base. 
9.09.05 - Notice by Publication. 
    After filing the Assessment Roll in the office of the Assessment Coordinator, as required by Section 9.09.04B thereof, the Assessment Coordinator shall publish once in a newspaper of general circulation within Volusia County a notice stating that at a meeting of the City Commission on a certain day and hour, not earlier than 20 calendar days from such publication, which meeting shall be a regular, adjourned or special meeting, the City Commission will hear objections of all interested persons to the Final Assessment Resolution and approval of the Assessment Roll. The published notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such notice shall include (A) a geographic depiction of the property subject to the Assessment; (B) the proposed schedule of the Assessment; (C) the method by which the Assessment shall be collected; (D) the Maximum Assessment Rate in the event one was adopted in the Initial Assessment Resolution; and (E) a statement that all affected property owners have the right to appear at the public hearing and to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, notice of a proposed Assessment may be given in any manner authorized by law. 
9.09.06 - Notice by Mail. 
    In addition to the published notice required by [Article] 9.09.05, Notice by Publication hereof, the Assessment Coordinator shall provide notice of the proposed Assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the Assessment. The mailed notice shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such notice shall include (A) the purpose of the Assessment; (B) the total Assessment to be levied against each parcel of property including a Maximum Assessment Rate in the event one was adopted by the Initial Assessment Resolution; (C) the Assessment Unit to be applied to determine the Assessment; (D) the number of such Assessment Units contained in each parcel; (E) the total revenue to be collected by the Assessment; and (F) a statement that failure to pay the Assessment will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the property or foreclosure proceedings may be instituted, either of which may result in a loss of title to the property; (G) a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the hearing and to file written objections with the City Commission within 20 days of the notice; and (H) the date, time and place of the hearing. Notice shall be mailed at least 20 calendar days prior to the hearing to each property owner at such address as is shown on the Tax Roll at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of mailing; provided, however, that failure to mail or receive such notice shall not invalidate any Assessment imposed hereunder. Notice shall be deemed mailed upon delivery thereof to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service. The Assessment Coordinator may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, notice of a proposed Assessment may be given in any manner authorized by law. 
9.09.07 - Adoption of Final Assessment Resolution. 
A.  At the time named in such notices, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken, the City Commission shall conduct a public hearing to receive written objections and hear testimony of interested persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the City Commission, adopt the Final Assessment Resolution which shall: 
1.  confirm, modify or repeal the Initial Assessment Resolution with such amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the City Commission; 
2.  create the Assessment Area; 
3.  establish the maximum amount of the Assessment for each Assessment Unit; 
4.  approve the Assessment Roll, with such amendments as it deems just and right; and 
5.  determine the method of collecting the Assessments and when collection shall commence. 
B.  In any instance where the public hearing is adjourned or continued prior to adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution or any Annual Assessment Resolution requiring mailed notice as provided in Section 9.09.08 hereof, the City shall not be required to provide additional notices pursuant to Sections 9.09.05, Notice by Publication and/or 9.09.06, Notice by Mail, hereof, provided: 
1.  The public hearing is continued to a time and date certain as determined by majority vote of the City Commission at the public hearing included in the original mailed notices; and 
2.  Such time and date certain is within sixty (60) days of the public hearing date included in the original mailed notices. 
9.09.08 - Annual Assessment Resolution. 
    The City Commission shall adopt an Annual Assessment Resolution during its budget adoption process for each Fiscal Year in which Assessments will be imposed to approve the Assessment Roll for such Fiscal Year. The Final Assessment Resolution shall constitute the Annual Assessment Resolution for the initial Fiscal Year. The Assessment Roll, as prepared in accordance with the Initial Assessment Resolution and confirmed or amended by the Final Assessment Resolution, shall be confirmed or amended by the Annual Assessment Resolution to reflect the then applicable portion of the cost of the Capital Improvements or Essential Services, or both, to be paid by Assessments. If the proposed Assessment for any parcel of property exceeds the Maximum Assessment Rate established in the Initial Assessment Resolution for the area and described in the notices provided pursuant to Sections 9.09.05, Notice by Publication and/or 9.09.06, Notice by Mail, hereof or if an Assessment is imposed against property not previously subject thereto, the City Commission shall provide notice to the owner of such property in accordance with [Article] 9.09.06, Notice by Mail hereof and conduct a public hearing prior to adoption of the Annual Assessment Resolution. In the case of an Annual Assessment Resolution which approves an Assessment against property not previously subject thereto, notice and public hearing shall not be required if all owners of the newly affected property provide written consent to the imposition of the Assessment. Failure to adopt an Annual Assessment Resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time. 
9.09.09 - Effect of Assessment Resolutions. 
    The adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution or of an Annual Assessment Resolution requiring notice as provided in Section 9.09.08 Annual Assessment Resolution hereof, shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the apportionment methodology, the rate of assessment, the maximum annual Assessment of each parcel, the adoption of the Assessment Roll and the levy and lien of the Assessments), unless proper steps are initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the City Commission's adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution. The Assessments for each Fiscal Year shall be established upon adoption of the Annual Assessment Resolution. If the Assessments are to be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the Assessment Roll, as approved by the Annual Assessment Resolution, shall be certified to the Tax Collector. 
9.09.10 - Repayment of Assessments. 
A.  Unless determined otherwise in the applicable Initial Assessment Resolution, Final Assessment Resolution or any Annual Assessment Resolution, the Assessment imposed against any parcel of property to fund Capital Improvements shall be subject to prepayment at the option of the property owner, as follows: 
1.  Prior to the issuance of Obligations, the Assessment Coordinator shall provide first class mailed notice to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the Assessment of the City Commission's intent to issue such Obligations. On or prior to the date specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the thirtieth day following the date on which the notice is delivered to the possession of the U.S. Postal Service), or such later date as the City Commission may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the Assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total Assessment obligation. 
2.  Following the date specified in the notice provided pursuant to Section 9.09.10 (A)(1) hereof, or such later date as the City Commission may allow in its sole discretion, the owner of each parcel of property subject to the Assessment shall be entitled to prepay the total remaining Assessment upon payment of an amount equal to the sum of (a) such parcel's share of the principal amount of Obligations then outstanding, (b) the premium associated with redemption of such parcel's share of the principal amount of Obligations then outstanding, and (c) interest on such parcel's share of the principal amount of Obligations then outstanding, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid to the next date following such prepayment on which the City can redeem Obligations after providing all notices required by the ordinance or resolution authorizing issuance of such Obligations; provided however, that during any period commencing on the date the annual Assessment Roll is certified for collection pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and ending on the next date on which unpaid ad valorem taxes become delinquent, the City may reduce the amount required to prepay the Assessments imposed against any parcel of property by the amount of the Assessment certified for collection with respect to such parcel. 
B.  At the City's election, the Assessment imposed against any parcel of property may be subject to acceleration and mandatory prepayment if at any time a tax certificate has been issued and remains outstanding in respect of such property. In such event, the amount required for mandatory prepayment shall be the same as that required for an optional prepayment authorized by Section 9.09.10(A)(2) hereof. 
C.  The amount of all prepayments computed in accordance with this Section 9.09.10 shall be final. The City shall not be required to refund any portion of a prepayment if (1) the Capital Cost is less than the amount upon which such prepayment was computed, or (2) annual Assessments will not be imposed for the full number of years anticipated at the time of such prepayment. 
9.09.11 - Lien of Assessments. 
A.  Upon adoption of the Annual Assessment Resolution for each Fiscal Year, Assessments to be collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the City Commission of the Annual Assessment Resolution and shall attach to the property included on the Assessment Roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes. 
B.  Upon adoption of the Final Assessment Resolution, Assessments to be collected under the alternative method of collection provided in Section 9.09.17 Alternative Method of Collection hereof shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid. The lien shall be deemed perfected on the date notice thereof is recorded in the Official Records of Volusia County, Florida. 
C.  The lien of any Assessment imposed against any tax parcel hereunder shall survive a tax sale, and the purchaser of such parcel shall take title thereto subject to the lien of the Assessment. 
9.09.12 - Revisions to Assessments. 
    If any Assessment made under the provisions of this Article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the City Commission is satisfied that any such Assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the City Commission has omitted the inclusion of any property on the Assessment Roll which property should have been so included, the City Commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new Assessment against any property benefited by the Capital Improvement or Essential Service, following as nearly as may be practicable the provisions of this Article, and in case such second Assessment is annulled, the City Commission may levy and impose other Assessments until a valid Assessment is imposed. 
9.09.13 - Procedural Irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any Assessment under the provisions of this Article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any Assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such Assessment was duly levied, that the Assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all proceedings related to such Assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required by this Article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.09.13, Procedural Irregularities, any party objecting to an Assessment imposed pursuant to this Article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
9.09.14 - Corrections of Errors and Omissions. 
A.  No act of error or omission on the part of the City Commission, Assessment Coordinator, Property Appraiser, Tax Collector, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of any Assessment imposed by the City Commission under the provisions of this Article. 
B.  The number of Assessment Units attributed to a parcel of property may be corrected at any time by the Assessment Coordinator, including upon presentation of competent substantial evidence by the owner of such parcel. Any such correction which reduces an Assessment shall be considered valid from the date on which the Assessment was imposed and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the Assessment imposed under the provisions of this Article. Any such correction which increases an Assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner at the address shown on the Tax Roll notifying the owner of the date, time and place that the City Commission will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. 
C.  After the Assessment Roll has been delivered to the Tax Collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to errors and insolvencies for ad valorem taxes. 
9.09.15 - Collection of Assessments. 
9.09.16 - Method of Collection. 
    Unless directed otherwise by the City Commission, Assessments (other than Assessments imposed against Government Property) shall be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the City shall comply with all applicable provisions thereof, including but not limited to (1) entering into a written agreement with the Property Appraiser and the Tax Collector for reimbursement of necessary expenses, (2) certifying the Assessment Roll to the Tax Collector, and (3) adopting a Resolution of Intent after publishing weekly notice of such intent for four consecutive weeks preceding the hearing. The Resolution of Intent may be adopted either prior to or following the Initial Assessment Resolution; provided, however, that the Resolution of Intent must be adopted prior to January 1 (March 1 with consent of the Property Appraiser and Tax Collector) of the year in which the Assessments are first collected on the ad valorem tax bill. This section shall not be construed to require adoption of an additional Resolution of Intent, and notice thereof, if a Resolution of Intent was previously adopted and is currently in effect for the area in question. Any hearing or notice required by this Article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
9.09.17 - Alternative Method of Collection. 
    In lieu of using the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the City may elect to collect the Assessment by any other method which is authorized by law or provided by this Section 9.09.17 as follows: 
A.  The City shall provide Assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property, other than Government Property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the Assessment, (2) a description of the Assessment Units used to determine the amount of the Assessment, (3) the number of Assessment Units attributable to the parcel, (4) the total amount of the parcel's Assessment for the appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, (6) the date on which the Assessment is due, and (7) a statement that the Assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
B.  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the Assessments shall be recorded in the Official Records of Volusia County, Florida. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the Official Records. 
C.  The City shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent Assessments in the manner provided by law. An Assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the due date. The City or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of an Assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such Assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the City or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent Assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
D.  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the City may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The City may join in one foreclosure action the collection of Assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent Assessments and any other costs incurred by the City as a result of such delinquent Assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
E.  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent Assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however, that (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this Article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent Assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the Assessment Roll to the Tax Collector. 
9.09.18 - Responsibility for Enforcement.

Improvements or new construction of collector or arterial roadways shall include provision for sidewalks and bikeways within the right-of-way. 
3.  Repair. When a public sidewalk exists, the landowner is responsible for any repair or replacement of sidewalk or bike path which is damaged by the landowner or builder. 
4.  Reserved. 
5.  When acceleration, deceleration and/or turning lanes are incorporated into a street with on-road bicycle facilities, the extra land width, paved shoulder, or bike lane should be incorporated into the right-hand through lane, with FDOT design standards being met. 
6.  Sidewalks shall be required to be constructed on any new or redeveloped, individual or subdivided, residential or non-residential development site. The developer may have an alternative of paying an "in lieu of' fee for sidewalk construction if it is determined by the City Commission that a public purpose will be served by applying said fee to an existing, or planned, sidewalk linkage rather than constructing the sidewalk on the development site. The City of Lake Helen shall prioritize street segments with sidewalk gaps. The following criteria shall be used in prioritizing sidewalk gap improvements: 
a.  Proximity to schools. 
b.  Proximity to major public parks or cultural facilities. 
c.  Proximity to residential and commercial areas, or any area exhibiting a high volume of walking.

    It is the intent of the City Commission of the City of Lake Helen to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to ensure the protection of the travelling public and the citizens of the City of Lake Helen by this legislative enactment. 
11.06.01 - Use of Golf Carts within City of Lake Helen. 
1.  In accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 316.212, relating to the operation of golf carts on roadways, the operation of a golf cart upon the streets of the City is permitted on streets within the municipal limits of Lake Helen with posted speed limits of 30 m.p.h. or less. The City Commission has determined that golf carts may safely travel on and/or cross the public roads and/or streets of Lake Helen, considering the facts of speed, volume, and the character of pedestrian, non-motorized travel and all motor vehicle traffic, using the streets of the City of Lake Helen. 
2.  Upon a determination that golf carts may be safely operated on a designated road or street, the City Administrator or his/her designee, shall post appropriate signs to indicate that such operation is authorized and allowed. With regard to the streets where the operation of golf carts is prohibited, the City Commission has, and shall be deemed for all purposes to have, determined that such prohibition is necessary in the interest of public safety in accordance with subsection 1 hereof. 
3.  A golf cart may be operated at any time, day or night, on public roads or streets with a posted speed limit of 30 m.p.h. or less provided the golf cart is equipped with headlights, brake lights, turn signals, a windshield, and such other equipment as is required in subsection 5 hereof. The City Administrator or his/her designee, shall post appropriate informational signage within the City upon specific direction from the City Commission. 
4.  No golf cart shall be driven, operated, or controlled on the public roads or streets of the City of Lake Helen unless the golf cart has a visible City of Lake Helen permit tag on the golf cart that is current and unrevoked indicating compliance with all necessary laws.

2.  All vehicular access points shall be located one hundred feet (100'), or two-thirds (2/3) the length of the parcel frontage on the street, whichever is less, from the intersection of any right-of-way lines of streets or a street and a railroad. 
11.08.00 - Off-Street Parking and Loading. 
    This section implements the Transportation Element goals of ensuring an efficient flow of on-site traffic and providing for adequate parking, loading and fire lane facilities. 
11.08.01 - Off-Street Parking Design Standards. 
1.  Parking areas shall be surfaced with acceptable materials, shall be constructed in compliance with the City's stormwater management regulations, shall contain wheel stops for individual vehicle parking space delineation and shall be constructed in compliance with the City's landscaping regulations. 
2.  Acceptable materials means a durable all-weather surface composed of concrete, brick, asphalt, permanent porous grating, or other permanent dust-free surfaces. The aforesaid notwithstanding, the City may, during the development review process, and on an individual project specific basis, consider approval of the use of alternate parking area surface materials. Such consideration shall weigh such factors as surface materials proposed, site location, site topography, environmental benefits, size of parking area, maintenance requirements, site aesthetics, potential impacts on surrounding properties, potential impacts on City rights-of-way and facilities, and hours and days of use of the parking area. 
11.08.02 - Off-Street Parking Requirements. 
1.  The following matrix Table 11E specifies the required minimum number of off-street automobile and bicycle parking spaces for a specific land use. 
2.  A plan showing off-street parking and delineating traffic flow within shall be submitted to and approved by the City Administrator or his/her designee before a permit is issued for the construction or use of the building, structure or facility being considered, except for single-family residences. This plan shall show the location and accurately designate the number and size of spaces, access aisles, drive-thru window(s) location and associated drive-thru queue parking, driveways/access points, loading zones, fire lanes, and dumpster locations. The off-street parking plan shall be included in the site plan submittal requirements. 
3.  The number of parking spaces for uses not specifically listed in the matrix shall be determined by the City Administrator or his/her designee. They shall consider requirements for similar uses and appropriate traffic engineering and planning data, and shall establish a minimum number of spaces based upon the principles of this Code. 
4.  For several uses listed in the matrix the parking requirement is to be determined by the City Administrator or his/her designee. These uses have a large variability in parking demand, making it impossible to specify a single parking requirement. A developer proposing to develop or expand one of these uses must submit a parking study that provides justification for the requirement proposed. The City Administrator or his/her designee will review this study along with any traffic engineering and planning data that are appropriate to the establishment of a parking requirement for the use proposed. 
5.  For the purpose of computing the number of off-street parking spaces, the gross floor area (GFA) of a building is the sum of the gross horizontal area of all floors of a building measured from the exterior faces of exterior walls. Seating capacity is the total number of seats or chairs permitted for a use. For the purposes of this section, one (1) seat shall mean one seating area which can accommodate one (1) person sitting, such as one (1) chair or one (1) such area on a church pew or bench. The applicant is encouraged to develop a parking plan which can prove the number of actually needed spaces for a site and use, and based on the supporting evidence the City Administrator or his/her designee can approve the applicant's parking plan. 
6.  When computing the number of required parking spaces, round to the nearest whole number. 
7.  Excessive parking spaces beyond that required are not encouraged. If requested by the applicant and approved by the City Administrator or his/her designee, excessive parking shall not be located as part of the required principle parking facility or area. 
8.  A reduction in the number of parking spaces may be granted by the City Administrator or his/her designee if the applicant can demonstrate that a reasonable number of trips to the site will be generated by transportation not requiring parking; or joint use with another site that has different temporal parking demands will satisfy parking space requirements. 
9.  Any parking area to be used by the general public shall provide suitable, marked parking spaces for handicapped persons. The number, design and location of these spaces shall be consistent with the requirements of Sections 316.1955 and 316.1956, Florida Statutes, or succeeding provisions. Parking space required for the handicapped shall be counted as a parking space to comply with the minimum requirements of this Code. All spaces for the handicapped shall be paved. 
10.  Compact car parking spaces may satisfy no more than twenty-five (25%) percent of required parking spaces. These spaces shall use appropriate signage and shall be located no more or no less conveniently than standard size car spaces. 
11.  For the purposes of this section, a compact vehicle is defined as any vehicle less than fifteen feet (180 inches) in length. A standard vehicle is any vehicle that is fifteen feet or larger. 
12.  Off-street parking shall be available for use prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy. 
13.  A permit shall be required for any temporary use of right-of-way. Permanent use of right-of-way is prohibited. 
11.08.03 - Shared Parking Provisions. 
    Shared parking may be applied when land uses have different parking demand patterns and can use the same parking spaces/areas throughout the day or night. Shared parking may also be applied when an existing development can demonstrate excess parking. Factors evaluated to establish shared parking arrangements shall include operating hours, seasonal/weekly/daily peaks in parking demand, the site's orientation, location of access driveways, accessibility to other nearby parking areas, pedestrian connections, distance to parking area, and availability of parking spaces. 
    Shared parking is subject to an agreement that addresses the following: 
1.  The agreement is valid only as long as the conditions described in the application for the shared parking exist. The City must be a party identified in the agreement requiring a signature from the City Administrator or his/her designee, and the agreement must be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney recorded with the Volusia County Clerk of Courts. 
2.  A copy of the recorded agreement shall be submitted to the City Clerk within ten (10) days of its recording. 
11.08.04 - Off-Site Parking. 
    Up to 75% of the overall required parking may be met in off-site parking areas through a shared parking agreement. A pedestrian connection providing a safe, well lighted walking environment shall be required.

Article 12. - LEVEL OF SERVICE (LOS) CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT 

12.00.00 - General Provisions/Purpose, Intent and Applicability. 
    This article is established for the purpose of ensuring that the issuance of a building permit will not degrade the level of service for any facility located within the City below the adopted level of service standard. This article provides processes for measuring compliance with level of service (LOS) standards adopted in the Comprehensive Plan for the following public facilities: transportation; potable water; solid waste; stormwater; public schools; and, parks and recreation. No final development order or building permit shall be issued to construct, reconstruct, or alter any building or structure; use of an existing building shall be not be changed; and no special exception shall be granted; until a site plan for the property has been reviewed and evaluated to determine compliance with the concurrency management provisions of this article. Any proposed rezoning which would result in an increase in the densities or intensities of development, shall be tested for facility capacity and concurrency at the time of rezoning. 
    Concurrency evaluation is one factor in the development review process, and compliance with only this article does not guarantee approval of the project. Unless otherwise provided herein, this article shall apply to all new developments of structures or property and the additional impacts from changes to existing development. The provisions of this article shall assess only the net impacts created from the development of a lot. Please reference Section 12.01.00 of this article which lists those projects exempt from the concurrency evaluation review process. 
12.01.00 - Concurrency Requirements. 
1.  A Concurrency Certificate shall be required to be granted by the City prior to the issuance of the earliest of the following development permit or approvals except as exempted in the Article. The following are determined to require a concurrency certificate: 
a.  Building Permit. 
b.  Preliminary Development Order. 
c.  Final Development Order. 
d.  Final Plat. 
2.  A Concurrency Certificate shall not be required prior to commencement of construction of any new public facility by any other government, school board, quasi-governmental agency or health care facility constructed to meet the obligation to furnish health care services to indigents and residents of the district and authorities created by the special legislative acts creating the independent special taxing districts to the extent that such construction is authorized by the special acts as they may be amended. 
3.  A Concurrency Certificate shall not be required when development orders or building permits for single family homes or duplexes within existing platted subdivisions of record recorded prior to the effective date of this Article or where all public facilities required within the subdivision to support the property has been provided and accepted by the City. 
4.  If a proposed development includes land use of such low intensity as to have a de minimis effect, if any, upon the level of service standards set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan, the development shall be exempt from concurrency review. De minimis development impact for transportation concurrency applies to a project that does not exceed one percent (1%) of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service (LOS) on affected transportation facilities. Said project shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. 
5.  A Concurrency Certificate shall not be required for the replacement of structures destroyed by fire, hurricanes, tornadoes or other acts of God not exceeding the area and cubic content of the structure prior to its destruction. 
6.  If the proposed change of use shall have an impact on public facilities and/or services which is equal to or less than the previous use, then the proposed change, redevelopment or modification of use may proceed without the encumbrance of additional capacity in accordance with the provisions of this Article. 
7.  All applications for development orders or permits shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the City. 
8.  The standards used in the review of projects for available capacity shall be the level of service standards established in the City's Comprehensive Plan referenced below:

b.  Trip generation rates shall be based upon the latest edition of ITE's Trip Generation Manual or other specific local site surveys deemed by the City to be representative of the proposed use. All generated trips shall be assumed to be external, unless documented. Any internal capture passerby, or transit that is assumed, must be documented and is subject to acceptance by the City. 
c.  For commercial projects which are greater than five (5) acres or generate more than 100 P.M. peak hour trip ends, the applicant shall provide a traffic study which is certified by a Florida Registered professional engineer. 
d.  Where improvement to an existing facility is proposed, and no change in use of the existing facility is being made, the trip generation calculation may reflect only the newly proposed improvement and its use. Where improvement to and/or change in use of an existing facility is proposed the trip generation calculation shall reflect the volume of traffic generated by the existing facility's current and/or new use(s) and the volume of traffic generated by improvements if proposed (i.e. the combined uses). 
e.  For phased developments, calculation of the trip generation traffic volume and traffic impact analysis shall be presented for the completed development, and shall include all proposed phases of development and land uses. 
f.  Where the proposed development lies within one mile of an educational facility or ancillary facility, potentially impacted by changes if traffic volume and where A.M. trips are germane, both A.M. and P.M. traffic counts and impacts must be calculated. 
g.  In determining the impact of a project, the review shall encompass the impact within a minimum one-half mile of the development site. However, the City may require a larger traffic impact area to be studied based on the scale of the project and its traffic generation.

13.12.00 - Variance and Special Exception Guidelines. 
    A Variance or Special Exception may be granted, upon application, from the terms and provisions of this article as will not be contrary to the public health, safety, welfare and morals where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. Such Variance or Special Exception may be granted by the City Commission after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission. 
    Variances. The Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission shall hear and make recommendations to the City Commission regarding requests for variances from the quantitative terms of the zoning regulations where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary and undue hardship upon, and personal to, the applicant therefor, and not surrounding properties. In order to recommend approval of said variance, the Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission must find: 
1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district; such on-site conditions may include, but are not limited to, topography, preservation of vegetation, access, vehicular and pedestrian safety and preservation of scenic views; 
2.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
3.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the article to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district; 
4.  That literal interpretation of the provisions would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the article and would work [incur] unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant; 
5.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
6.  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this code and the comprehensive plan, will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; 
7.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located; 
8.  In granting any variance, the commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, the violation of which shall be deemed a violation of this code. The commission may also prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance was requested shall be begun, completed or both; 
9.  Under no circumstances shall the commission grant a variance which permits a use not generally, or by special exception use, permitted in the zoning district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited, by the terms of this code in the zoning district involved. Nonconforming uses of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning classifications or district, and permitted uses of lands, structures or buildings in other zoning classifications or districts shall not be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. For purposes of this section, an unnecessary hardship shall mean that without the granting of the variance or special exception the owner will be deprived of all reasonable use of the property as allowed in the zoning district; 
10.  The public notice and approval process for a variance and a site plan is the same. Since they are the same, the City can approve variances as part of the site planning process assuming that the site plan approval goes through the approval process and the required notices are provided for site plan approval and the notices incorporate the notice provisions for a variance. However, the review criteria for a variance approval shall remain the same. 
    Special Exception Uses. The Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission shall hear and make recommendations to the City Commission on requests for Special Exception uses. In doing so, the commission may decide such questions as are involved in determining when special exception uses should be granted and either grant special uses with appropriate conditions and safeguards or deny special exception uses. After review of an application and a public hearing thereon, the Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission (PLDRC) may make a recommendation that the City Commission allow special exception uses only upon a determination that the use meets the following standards: 
a.  The intensity of the proposed use is harmonious with the character of the area and is consistent with trends of development in the area. 
b.  Does not have an unduly adverse effect on existing traffic patterns, movements, intensity, and safety. 
c.  Is consistent with the comprehensive plan goals and policies and the density/intensity standards based on the Comprehensive Plan and Future Land Use Map for the district in which the property is located. 
d.  The proposed use is consistent with the intent of the zoning district in which it is located. 
e.  The proposed use shall not be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, and morals of adjoining properties or residents of the city, and shall be economically beneficial to the city. 
f.  The height and orientation of any proposed structure(s) shall be compatible with existing neighboring structures. 
g.  The subject property shall be of adequate size and shape to accommodate the proposed development while providing adequate separation from neighboring uses. 
h.  The proposed use shall not create or intensify flooding issues on neighboring properties. 
i.  The proposed use shall be effectively buffered so as to screen neighboring properties from traffic, noise, light, odor, or visual impacts. 
j.  The refuse and/or loading areas shall be adequately screened so as not to have visual, odor, or noise impacts on neighboring properties. 
k.  The size, design, and location of proposed sign(s) shall be in conformance with the city sign regulations, as well as being compatible with neighboring uses. 
l.  Exterior lighting shall be harmonious with neighboring uses in terms of glare and intensity. 
m.  On-site traffic circulation shall meet the requirements for the Police Department, Fire Department and other first responders.

    Annexation is the process of adding real property to the boundaries of the City of Lake Helen. Once annexed, the property becomes fully a part of the City and realizes all benefits and services thereof. The Florida Statutes will allow unincorporated property to be annexed only if it is contiguous with the City limits. 
    In order for specific property within unincorporated areas to be voluntarily annexed, F.S. ch. 171.044 requires the following criteria be met:

Alternatively, if the City determines the County's designations are not the most appropriate for the property, a request for City designations must be made in accordance with the Land Use Plan Amendment process. In either case, a Zoning Map Amendment request must be made to establish a City Zoning designation that is consistent with the Future Land Use designation. 
13.19.02 - Procedure for Annexation. 
    The owner(s) of the properties shall meet with city staff and complete the application requesting Annexation. The Application will be forwarded to the Planning and Land Development Regulation Commission for review and recommendation to the City Commission and will ensure compliance with F.S. ch. 171.

1.  The request is consistent with the densities, intensities and general uses set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and LDC regulations. 
2.  The requested uses are compatible with existing or planned uses in the surrounding area. 
3.  Approval of the request will be consistent with the population density pattern and not place an undue burden upon existing transportation or other services, utilities and facilities and will be capable of being adequately served by them, should the highest use allowed by the requested zoning be developed. 
4.  The proposed uses are appropriate at the subject location. 
5.  The proposed change is consistent with the established land use pattern, and would not create an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts. 
6.  Changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary.

5.  If a code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, a code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violation of the same and may immediately issue a citation and schedule the matter for a hearing before a special magistrate.

4.  A special magistrate shall advise the alleged violator of the section of the code of which he or she is accused of violating and the nature of the violation. A special magistrate shall first seek to determine whether or not the alleged violator admits the violation.

If the alleged violator denies the violation, the special magistrate shall hear first from the city and any city witnesses and evidence, and the alleged violator shall have the right to cross-examine city witnesses. At the close of the presentation of the city's case against the alleged violator, the violator shall be permitted to present his evidence, testimony of other witnesses and his own testimony in his defense.

A.  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
B.  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
C.  When activities described in subsections A. and B. are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
D.  When the activities described in subsections A. and B. are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients; blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection C, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
E.  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur often are constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
F.  The activities described in subsections A. and B. occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulations by the City in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City. 
G.  The activities described in subsections A. and B. often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
H.  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections A. and B. leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
I.  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections A. and B. creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
J.  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City, it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur. 
K.  Employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
L.  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers, poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
M.  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City, it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur. 
N.  The potential dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this Article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
O.  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
P.  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residence, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parts, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
Q.  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsections A. and B. occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.

A reverse repurchase agreement (REPO) consists of two simultaneous transactions. One is the purchase of securities (collateral) by an investor from a bank or broker. The other is the commitment by the bank or broker to repurchase the securities at the same price for a mutually agreed-upon time. A standard "PSA" repurchase agreement will be signed with the financial institution, which also defines collateral and maturities of the collateral. 
G.  Corporate Bonds. Corporate bonds are issued by corporations that are raising funds for specific purposes (i.e. capital projects). The City is limited to investing in corporate bonds that are AAA rated by Standard and Poor's and Moody's. The City position is also limited to less than five percent (5%) of the entire portfolio. 
H.  Banker's Acceptance. A banker's acceptance is a draft or bill of exchange. The City is limited to the fifty largest domestic banks, which must be "A" rated by Standard and Poor's or Moody's. This investment position is also limited to five percent (5%) of the entire portfolio.

These funds include, but are not limited to, money market mutual funds, adjustable-rate U.S. security funds, and short-term U.S. security funds. 
27.13.00 - Delivery vs. Payment Method. 
    Regardless of the size or sophistication of the jurisdiction, all responsible officials must install some kind of mechanism to ensure that all of the City's investment or liquidation transactions are performed on a "delivery vs. Payment" basis, whereby delivery of and payments for the security are simultaneous. In general, this approach will accomplish several things: 
A.  Since the jurisdiction will not release funds from its bank account until it has physical possession of the interest-earning asset (investment), it will minimize any risk of losing a day's (or a weekend's) interest due to failure on the part of the seller of the investment security. 
B.  A "delivery vs. payment" approach will ensure that jurisdictional funds are not released in the absence of receiving perfected investment securities in proper dollar denominations. 
C.  The accountability and verifiability of the transaction will be enhanced; written third-party documentation is a natural byproduct of the "delivery vs. payment" or "payment vs. delivery" approach. 
27.14.00 - Policy Review and Amendments. 
    The City's Investment Ordinance will be reviewed yearly by the City Administrator. If investment conditions dictate a change prior to this yearly review, then City Administrator may submit these changes to the City Commission.

    The City Administrator shall exercise and monitor a set of internal controls, designed to protect the City's funds and ensure proper accounting and reporting of the securities transactions. Such internal controls shall consist of the following: 
A.  All securities purchased or sold will be transferred only under the "delivery versus payment" (D.V.P.) method to ensure that funds or securities are not released until all criteria relating to the specific transaction are met. 
B.  The City Administrator is authorized to accept on behalf of and in the name of the City, bank trust receipts or confirmations as evidence of actual delivery of the obligation or securities in return for investment of funds. 
C.  Trust receipts or confirmations shall fully describe the various obligations or securities held. The receipt or confirmation shall state that the investment is held in the name of the City.

E.  There will be adequate separation of duties with clear delegation of authority among investment personnel.
