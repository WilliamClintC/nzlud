PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Charter of the City of Maitland, Florida, the Maitland City Code, indexes to each, and various tracing tables to facilitate their use. For a detailed discussion of the contents of Part I, the Charter, see the footnote at the bottom of page 1. 
    The Maitland City Code, which comprises Part II of the volume, constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The Code was analyzed in 1991 and the changes pursuant to the analyzation were implemented with the publication of Supplement No. 13. 
    The Code was again analyzed in 1999 and republished in 2000 with the inclusion of ordinances received for publication subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 19 through Ord. No. 995, adopted March 27, 2000. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Maitland City Code, adopted December 14, 1971, and effective January 15, 1972, as supplemented through September 10, 1979, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. Reference in these notes to "Code 1971" means the former Code as amended and supplemented. Thus, for example, a citation to "Code 1971, § 131/2-2" means § 131/2-2 as enacted by Ordinance No. 496. To obtain the complete legislative history of a section, the user will therefore need to consult the supplemented copy of the old Code on file in the office of the City Clerk. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two figures separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the thirteenth section of chapter 9 is 9-13. New sections can be inserted in their proper places in the future by using a decimal system for amendments. If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-37 and 6-38 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-37.1, 6-37.2 and 6-37.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 7 and 8 it will be designated as chapter 7.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this volume up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Republication 
    The republication of the Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Town of Lake Maitland was originally organized as a municipal corporation under the general laws of the state on July 17, 1885. See Miscellaneous Records, Orange County, Vol. 5, p. 225. This incorporation was validated by Laws of Fla. 1909, Ch. 6068. Subsequent acts affecting the town were Laws of Fla. 1919, Ch. 8297; 1931, Ch. 15298; 1933, Ch. 16524; 1937, Chs. 18640, 18641 and 18642; 1949, Ch. 25957; and Ch. 57-1487. 
Chapter 59-1475 constituted a new charter for the municipality, changing its name to the City of Maitland. This charter was in turn superseded and a new charter enacted by Laws of Fla., Ch. 70-793. 
Said Chapter 70-793 is set out, as enacted and from time to time amended, in this Part I, except that its title has been omitted and the editors have added words and phrases in brackets where necessary in the interest of clarity. Amendments have been worked into their proper places and amended or repealed provisions deleted. Amendatory acts are cited in parentheses following the provisions amended; the absence of such a citation indicates that the particular provision has not been amended and is as originally contained in the 1970 act. 
Chapter 70-793 became a law without the Governor's approval, was filed in the office of the Secretary of State on June 19, 1970, and became effective on July 1, 1970, as provided in section 11.05(i) hereof. 

ARTICLE I. - POWERS OF THE CITY 

Sec. 1.01. - Powers of the city. 
    The city shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the constitution and laws of this state as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this charter. 
State Law reference- Powers of municipalities generally, Fla. Const., Art. VIII, § 2(b); F.S. § 166.021. 
Sec. 1.02. - Construction. 
    The powers of the city under this charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific mention of particular powers in the charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general power stated in this article. Whenever words used in this charter refer to the masculine gender, they shall include the feminine and neuter gender and vice versa. 
(Ord. No. 957, § 1, 10-26-98; Ord. No. 1232, § 3(Amend. 1), 11-26-12) 
Sec. 1.03. - Intergovernmental relations. 
    The city may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one or more states or civil divisions or agencies thereof, or the United States or any agency thereof. 
Sec. 1.04. - Corporate limits.

ARTICLE II. - CITY COUNCIL 

Sec. 2.01. - Composition, eligibility, election and terms. 
(a)  Composition. There shall be a city council of five (5) members which includes the mayor elected by the qualified voters of the city at large. 
(b)  Eligibility. Only qualified voters of the city residing within the city limits of Maitland, Florida for a minimum of six (6) months prior to qualifying to run for office, shall be eligible to hold the office of mayor or city council. 
(c)  Term of office. The term of office of any person elected to the city council or mayor at any general election held in the city shall be for a period of approximately three (3) years and shall commence and begin at the 2nd council meeting after the certification of the election. Consecutive terms of any member of the city council and the mayor shall be limited to two (2) consecutive terms in office, either as mayor or council or any combination thereof. Additionally, if the mayor has served two (2) consecutive terms in office as mayor, the mayor shall be ineligible to run for the office of city council member in the next regular city election. The time served by a person appointed, or elected to fill a vacancy on city council shall not constitute a full term of office if such time served does not exceed two (2) years. 
(d)  Waiting period after serving two (2) consecutive terms in office. If a candidate is not eligible to hold an office because the candidate has served two (2) consecutive terms in office, one regular city election of either mayor or city council (approximately one (1) year), shall have been held before the candidate shall be eligible to hold such office either by appointment or election. 
(e)  Effect of resigned office or vacated office on calculation of mayoral candidate waiting period. For the purpose of determining whether a candidate for mayor has served two (2) consecutive terms, any candidate for mayor who has resigned or otherwise vacated the mayor's office during the immediately prior term shall be deemed to have completed the full term of such office through the last day of the three (3) year term of such office regardless of the time served. 
(f)  Interpretation. It is the intention of this subsection that a candidate seeking the office of mayor, who has served two (2) consecutive terms in office as a member of council, but not as mayor, is eligible to seek the office of mayor, and, if elected, serve two (2) consecutive terms as mayor. It is the further intention of this subsection that a mayor who has served two (2) consecutive terms in office as mayor shall not be eligible to be a candidate for a position as a member of the city council without waiting one city election cycle.

(c)  Filling of vacancies. A vacancy in the council shall be filled by appointment of a successor by a majority vote of the remaining members of city council to serve until the next general election at which time there shall be elected a city council member for the balance of the unexpired term. If the city council fails to appoint a successor to serve to the date of the next general election within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of the vacancy, the election authority shall call a special election to fill the vacancy, to be held not sooner than ninety (90) days nor later than one hundred twenty (120) days following the occurrence of the vacancy, such election to be held pursuant to Article VIII of this charter.

I understand that my decisions affect the well-being of our community, now and in the future.

Represent our city with honesty and integrity, and not advance my personal interests at the expense of my fellow residents.

I shall work for the common good of all and not for any private or personal interest and I will endeavor to treat all persons, claims and transactions in a fair and equitable manner;

Inform myself of public issues, listen attentively to public discussion before the Council and focus on the business at hand; 
Make decisions based upon the merits and substance of the matter at hand; 
Make it my responsibility to publicly share substantive information that is relevant to a matter under consideration that may be received from sources outside of the public decision-making processes; 
Assure independence and impartiality on behalf of the public good, I shall not use my official position to influence government decisions in which I have a financial interest, where I have an organizational responsibility or a personal relationship that would present a conflict of interest under applicable State law; 
Not take advantage of services or opportunities not available to the general public for personal gain. I shall refrain from accepting gifts, favors or promises of future benefits that might compromise my independent judgment or action or give the appearance of being compromised; 
Respect and preserve the confidentiality of information provided to me concerning the confidential matters of the City. I shall neither disclose confidential information without proper legal authorization nor use such information to advance my financial or private interests; 
Respect and adhere to the Council-Manager structure of the City of Maitland City Government as provided by State and local law; 
Uphold the rights of future generations to advance their standard of living in a healthy community; 
Invest in developing myself, our citizens, and our city to create sustainable and inclusive prosperity;

(1)  The member upon electing any option of this section will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of his death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time, but any such change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the board of trustees. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and his retirement income benefits have commenced, he may thereafter change his designated joint pensioner or beneficiary, but only if the board of trustees consents to such change and if the joint pensioner last previously designated by him is alive when he files with the board of trustees his request for such change. 
(2)  Then consent of a member's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. 
(3)  The board of trustees may request such evidence of the good health of the joint pensioner that is being removed as it may require and the amount of the retirement income payable to the member upon designation of a new joint pensioner shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the member. Each such designation will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees, and on completion will be filed with the board of trustees. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the member, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the member subsequent to his retirement, shall be paid as provided in section 2-127. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, a retiree may change his or her designation of joint annuitant or beneficiary up to two (2) times without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint annuitant or beneficiary. The retiree is not required to provide proof of the good health of the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. Any change made under this subsection shall be actuarially neutral. 
(2)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date, or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under sections 2-129 and 2-130, subject to the limitations of section 2-124(6)(c), without regard to the existence of insurance policies. 
(b)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the plan, the option elected will be cancelled automatically and a retirement income of normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section, or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement and within ninety (90) days after the death of the beneficiary. 
(c)  If both the retired member, and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by him die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1)(c) of this section, the board of trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum, and in accordance with section 2-127. 
(d)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 2-125 and dies prior to his actual retirement and if the member has selected an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section and the option is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which member's death occurred. 
(e)  No firefighter or police officer may make any change in his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check.

(2)  If a deceased member fails to name a beneficiary in the manner above prescribed, or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member predecease the member, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the plan with respect to such deceased member may be paid to the estate of such deceased member, provided that in any such cases the board of trustees, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments be paid in a lump sum. Any payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board of trustees by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan regard to such deceased member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder.

Sec. 2-128. - Disability retirement. 
(1)  A member may retire from the service of the city under the plan if, he becomes totally and permanently disabled as defined in subsection (2) of this section by reason of any cause other than a cause set out in subsection (3) of this section on or after the effective date of the plan. Such retirement shall herein be referred to as disability retirement. 
(2)  A member will be considered totally disabled if in the opinion of the board of trustees, he is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter, volunteer firefighter, or police officer; and a member will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the board of trustees, such member is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than as specified in subsection (3) of this section.

(a)  Excessive and habitual use by the member of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics as determined by a medical doctor or medical examiner. 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections, or while committing a crime.

(4)  No member shall be permitted to retire under the provisions of this section until examined by a duly-qualified physician or surgeon, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and is found to be disabled in the degree and in the manner specified in this section. Any member retiring under this section may be examined periodically at the discretion of the board but not more often than every two (2) years by a duly-qualified physician or surgeon or board of physicians and surgeons to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. But in no instance shall this section be imposed after a member has reached normal retirement age. 
(5)  The benefits payable to a member who retires from the service of the city due to total and permanent disability as a direct result of a disability commencing prior to his normal retirement date is the monthly income payable for ten (10) years certain and life for which, if the member's disability occurred in the line of duty, his monthly benefit shall be the accrued retirement benefit, but shall not be less than sixty (60) percent of his average monthly salary at the time of disability. If after ten (10) years of service the disability is other than in the line of duty, the member's monthly benefit shall be the accrued normal retirement benefit, but shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of his average monthly salary at the time of disability. 
(6)  The monthly retirement income to which a member is entitled in the event of his disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such entitlement However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be, if the member recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery or, if the member dies without recovering from his disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the one hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later. Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled member shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. 
(7)  If the board of trustees finds that a member who is receiving a disability retirement income is, at any time prior to his normal retirement date, no longer disabled, as provided herein, the board of trustees shall direct that the disability retirement income be discontinued. Recovery from disability as used herein shall mean the ability of a member to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, or police officer, provided further, that if a member in receipt of a disability retirement accepts employment with another employer as a police officer or firefighter, the individual may, after review and consideration by the board, forfeit the right to his or her disability benefit. 
(8)  If the member recovers from disability and reenters the service as a firefighter, volunteer firefighter, or police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service will not be considered as credited service for the purpose of this plan. 
(9)  In lieu of the form of payment set forth in subsection (5) a member may elect an optional form of retirement as set forth in section 2-126.

(2)  Upon the death of an active member of this fund an additional lump sum death benefit shall be payable on his behalf in an amount equal to his annualized rate of base pay at the time of his death. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a member shall not be eligible for this benefit if he should have refused to perform any reasonable acts requested of him by an insurance company in order to place insurance in force upon his life.

The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the employee's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the employee. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the municipality, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality and the state. 
(5)  The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with the manner of distribution determined under subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the municipality or the board of trustees of the pension trust fund has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section

(c)  Adjustments in limitations. In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of § 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, but not less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) if the benefit begins at or after age fifty-five (55). 
In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable before age fifty-five (55), the seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) limitation shall be reduced from age fifty-five (55) in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of § 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. A member with at least fifteen (15) years of credited service may not have the benefit reduced below fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
If the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made using an assumed interest rate of five (5) percent and shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(d)  Less than ten (10) years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(e)  Ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this fund and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(f)  Member in defined contribution plan. In any case where a member under this fund is also a member in a "defined contribution plan," as defined in § 414(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, maintained by the city, the sum of the "defined benefit plan fraction" and the "defined contribution plan fraction" (both as defined in § 415(e) of the Internal Revenue Code) shall not exceed 1.0. 
(g)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(h)  Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated herein shall be adjusted to the time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to § 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Either the claimant or the board of trustees may cause a court reporter to attend the hearing and record the proceedings. In such event, a complete written transcript of the proceedings shall be furnished to both parties by the court reporter.

Sec. 2-142. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  Generally. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993.

Sec. 2-143. - Distribution of benefits. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this fund to the contrary, a form of retirement income payable from this fund after the effective date of this ordinance [Ord. No. 914, adopted Nov. 11, 1996], shall satisfy the following conditions: 
(1)  If the retirement income is payable before the member's death: 
(a)  It shall either be distributed or commence to the member not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2), or the calendar year in which member retires; and 
(b)  The distribution shall commence not later than the calendar year defined above, and (1) shall be paid over the life of the member or over the lifetimes of the member and spouse, issue or dependent, or (2) shall be paid over the period extending not beyond the life expectancy of the member and spouse, issue or dependent. 
Where a form of retirement income payment has commenced in accordance with the preceding paragraphs and the member dies before his entire interest in the fund has been distributed, the remaining portion of such interest in the fund shall be distributed no less rapidly than under the form of distribution in effect at the time of the member's death. 
(2)  If the member's death occurs before the distribution of his interest in the fund has commenced, member's entire interest in the fund shall be distributed within five (5) years of member's death, unless it is to be distributed in accordance with the following rules: 
(a)  The member's remaining interest in the fund is payable to his spouse, issue or dependent; 
(b)  The remaining interest is to be distributed over the life of the spouse, issue or dependent, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the spouse, issue or dependent; and 
(c)  Such distribution begins within one year of the member's death unless the member's spouse, issue or dependent shall receive the remaining interest, in which case the distribution need not begin before the date on which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2) and if the spouse, issue or dependent dies before the distribution to the spouse, issue or dependent begins, this section shall be applied as if the spouse, issue or dependent were the member. 
(Ord. No. 914, § 6, 11-11-96) 
Sec. 2-144. - Family Medical Leave Act. 
    On each March first a member may proceed to purchase fractional parts of years of credited service for time that he is on leave without pay from the city pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and such purchased time shall be added to his credited service provided that: 
(1)  The maximum credited service that can be purchased for FMLA leave time during a member's entire employment with the city is twelve (12) weeks. 
(2)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the fund for the fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(3)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March thirty-first. Credited service may be purchased once per year until twelve (12) weeks of credited service for FMLA leave time has been purchased. 
(4)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made on or before April thirtieth for the FMLA leave time being purchased and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be issued.

(Ord. No. 914, § 7, 11-11-96) 
Sec. 2-145. - Deferred retirement option plan (DROP). 
(a)  Creation of plan. There is hereby created a Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP). 
(b)  Members who have obtained eligibility for normal retirement may enter the DROP on the first day of the month coincident or next following the attainment of normal retirement eligibility . The DROP eligibility period begins when a member attains the age of fifty-five (55) years with at least ten (10) years of credited service, the member attains the age of forty-five (45) years with at least twenty (20) years of credited service, or when a member completes twenty (20) years of credited service, without regard to age, provided the member has elected to pay such additional contributions as may be required by the actuarial valuation adopted by the board. 
(c)  Limitation of DROP participation. Participation in the DROP shall be limited to a period not in excess of sixty (60) consecutive months. For each month in which a member delays entry into the DROP, following attainment of eligibility, one month of DROP participation shall be lost. No member shall be eligible to enter the DROP more than sixty (60) consecutive months after eligibility for normal retirement. 
(d)  Application. Application for entry into the DROP shall be on a form prescribed by the board. At the time of entry into the DROP, the member shall elect the retirement option desired in accordance with the terms of the plan. 
(e)  Effect of entry into DROP. At the time of entry into the DROP, a member's average final compensation and credited service shall be calculated as if the member had actually retired from service. A member shall accrue to his or her credit an amount equal to the monthly retirement benefit. For members who are eligible to participate in the DROP before April 1, 2015, the benefits accrued shall gain interest at the guaranteed rate equal to the actuarially assumed rate of investment return, compounded annually. For members who become eligible to participate in the DROP on or after April 1, 2015, the benefits accrued shall gain interest at either (i) a fixed rate of return of three (3) percent, compounded annually, or (ii) a rate equal to the net rate of investment return of the plan for the preceding plan year, compounded annually, but not less than zero (0) percent or more than ten (10) percent per annum. Net rate of investment return means the market rate of return on plan assets, net of all investment-related expenses. At the time of entry into the DROP members who become eligible to participate in the DROP on or after April 1, 2015 must elect one of the two interest rate options, and each member may change their option one time during the DROP period. Such election, and change in election, will be effective at the beginning of the following plan year. Upon conclusion of the DROP period, the member shall terminate service with the city. Entry into the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable decision to separate from service no later than the end of the maximum period of DROP participation based on the retirement date of the member. 
Nothing in this section shall prohibit a member from separating service prior to the completion of the maximum DROP participation period. 
(f)  Disability or death benefits while in DROP. In the event that a member shall become disabled while in the DROP or shall die while in the DROP, the member shall be presumed to have actually separated from the service and concluded DROP participation on the day prior to disability or death. In such case, the member who is disabled shall thereafter receive a normal retirement together with distribution of DROP assets accumulated to date. In the case of a deceased member, distribution of the DROP shall be made in accordance with the written designation of the member, or if no such designation exists, to the estate of the member. Survivorship benefits, if any, shall thereafter be payable in accordance with the terms of the retirement plan. 
(g)  Distribution of DROP assets. No member shall be entitled to distribution of DROP assets until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the actual termination of employment with the City. Prior to completion of the DROP period, members shall make an irrevocable election as to the method of DROP distribution. Benefits in the DROP plan may be taken in any of the following forms: 
(1)  Lump sum distribution, or 
(2)  Direct plan-to-plan rollover to another qualified retirement plan consistent with the terms of the Internal Revenue Code. 
One hundred eighty-day window to return to active membership: All police officers of any rank and all full time firefighters at or above the rank of lieutenant who are DROP participants as of March 24, 2003 and who are identified on the impact statement for Ord. No. 1076 shall be provided with a one hundred eighty (180) day window, within which to elect to return to active membership. Eligible DROP participants who are identified on the impact statement for Ord. No. 1076 and who elect to return to active membership shall be credited with all creditable service earned during the period of DROP participation. As a condition to returning to active employment, all eligible DROP participants identified on the impact statement for Ord. No. 1076 shall be required to: 
(1)  Make an irrevocable election to forfeit their DROP account balance, including DROP earnings; 
(2)  Withdraw from the DROP and reenter active service; and 
(3)  Pay to the Retirement Plan the value of employee contributions to cover the time spent in the DROP; provided that if the member elects to pay through payroll deduction, interest shall be assessed based on the Retirement Plan's actuarial assumed rate of investment return. Members shall not be assessed interest if payment is made to the Retirement Plan in a lump sum. Members shall have the option of paying the lump sum through rollover from an individual retirement account (IRA) or another tax qualified plan. 
All eligible DROP participants identified on the impact statement for this ordinance who elect to return to active membership under the window hereby created shall be permitted to re-enter the DROP at a later time, provided that: 
(1)  No member shall be eligible to enter the DROP more than sixty (60) consecutive months after eligibility for normal retirement; and 
(2)  Participation in the DROP shall be limited to a period not in excess of sixty (60) months, inclusive of the period of prior DROP participation. 
(h)  Contributions. Upon entry in the DROP, both employee and city contributions shall cease. 
(i)  Employment status while in DROP. For all purposes related to employment with the city, a member in the DROP plan shall be considered an active employee. For the purposes of the Retirement Plan, a member shall be deemed retired with a deferred distribution of retirement benefits until the conclusion of DROP participation. 
(j)  Rule-making authority. The board of trustees shall have the authority to establish uniform rules for the implementation and efficient administration of the DROP plan. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 6-22-98; Ord. No. 1056, § 1, 4-14-03; Ord. No. 1076, § 1, 11-24-03; Ord. No. 1225, § 3, 3-12-12; Ord. No. 1269, § 2, 3-9-15 ) 
Sec. 2-146. - Purchase of additional credited service. 
    Any member shall be permitted to purchase up to an additional five (5) years of credited service in the plan based upon honorable service in the United States Armed Forces or as a full-time law enforcement officer or firefighter employed by a city, county, state, federal or other public agency not otherwise provided for in section 2-123(9). Reserve military service other than call-up for full active duty shall not apply. Temporary, auxiliary, reserve, volunteer or private agency service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter shall not apply nor shall service as a correctional officer. Eligible members may receive this credited service by paying to the pension trust fund the actuarial cost of the service purchased, as determined by the actuary for the plan. Members purchasing this service credit shall provide the board of trustees with proof of prior military service and honorable discharge and prior law enforcement or fire service with honorable separation. No service credit may be purchased if the member is receiving or will receive any other retirement benefit based on this service except the federal military retirement system. Credited service purchased under this section shall not count towards any vesting requirements under the plan, however, it will count towards the required years of credited service as set forth in section 2-125. The board shall establish a uniform rule for the implementation of this provision. 
(Ord. No. 994, § 1, 2-28-00; Ord. No. 1169, § 2, 9-8-08; Ord. No. 1331, § 1, 6-11-18 ) 
Sec. 2-147. - Share plan. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of Chapters 175 and 185, Florida Statutes, and to provide a mechanism to pay required "Chapter 175 and 185 monies" to police officers, firefighters and retirees based on the growth of premium tax revenue pursuant to Chapters 175 and 185. The fund created by this section, hereinafter the City of Maitland Police Officer's and Firefighter's Retirement Fund Share Plan, shall be derived exclusively from monies received from the state and not from any additional taxes levied by the city and shall be in addition to the police officer and firefighter defined benefit pension paid by the City of Maitland Police Officer and Firefighter Retirement Fund. The share plan shall be administered by the board of trustees of the City of Maitland Police Officer and Firefighter Retirement Fund (hereinafter the "retirement fund"). 
(b)  In each year, after receipt of the annual distribution of chapter money from the state, the board of trustees, with the advice of their actuary, shall determine the amount of non-dedicated chapter money received by the city during the current fiscal year pursuant to F.S. § 175.131 and § 185.11. The sum of these amounts shall be known as the "available funds." There shall be separate share plans for police and fire; the police share plan shall be funded with Chapter 185 monies and the fire share plan shall be funded with 175 monies. Allocation of shares shall be computed at the end of each fiscal year, or as soon as is practicable thereafter. 
(c)  An individual share account shall be established for each active and retired member on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives. DROP participants shall be considered active members only for purposes of the share plan. Available funds for active members shall be invested by the board of trustees and may be commingled for investment purposes with the other assets of the retirement system. The individual balances and earnings or losses for each participant in the share plan shall be clearly identified on the statements prepared by the plan. Each active member will recognize investment gains or losses at the same rate as the rest of the plan's assets as invested by the plan investment managers. The calculation of interest and the rate shall clearly be identified on the statements prepared by the plan. The City of Maitland shall not incur any financial obligation in any manner relative to the share plan. 
(d)  After premium tax distributions are received from the state, the expense of administering the share plan for the preceding year shall be determined by the board of trustees and charged against monies received during such year. The first allocation of the share plan shall be after the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and shall consist of the reserve of unused revenue as of September 30, 2008, minus the current baseline in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 175 and 185, Florida Statutes. 
(e)  Available funds shall be allocated to each qualified participant in shares. Available funds shall be allocated to each active member by credit to the active member's individual account. Active members will receive a credit of one share for every month worked during the given fiscal year. An active member will not be entitled to his or her share account until fully vested in the plan with ten (10) years of credited service. Any members separating from service with less than ten (10) years of credited service will forfeit their share account. Retired members and disability retirees will receive a six-tenths (0.6) share for every year of credited service they have accrued in the retirement plan prior to separation from service with the City of Maitland. Available funds shall be allocated and paid in a lump sum, or by rollover to a qualified retirement plan, to each inactive member if he or she has retired under the terms of the retirement fund. 
(f)  The account balance for each active participant with at least ten (10) years of credited service shall be payable to the active members, in a lump sum or rollover to a qualified retirement plan, within ninety (90) days after separation of service with the City of Maitland, under the provisions of the retirement fund. 
(g)  The board of trustees shall be authorized to adopt any rules necessary for the administration of the share accounts. 
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 9-8-08) 
Sec. 2-148. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(1)  After normal retirement . Effective January 1, 2012, any retiree who is retired under normal retirement, pursuant to this plan and who is reemployed in the same capacity as a firefighter or police officer after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(2)  After early retirement .

Sec. 4.7-5. - General functions, powers and duties. 
(a)  Administrative review. The board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the administration or enforcement of the zoning code. 
It is the intent of this Code that questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the zoning administrator, and that such questions shall be presented to the board only on appeal from the decision of the zoning administrator, and that recourse from the decisions of the board shall be to the courts. It is further the intent of this code that the duties of the city council in connection with the zoning code shall not include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not preclude the city council from determining the compatibility of an initial zoning, rezoning, or permitted conditional use with the intent or standards applicable in any zoning district. 
(b)  Variance applications. The board shall review applications for variance from the terms of the zoning code. The board shall grant variances from the zoning code provisions in specific cases where, because of special circumstances, literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning code would result in unnecessary hardship. Before such a variance request may be approved, the board must find that the application meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to the other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district; 
(2)  Literal interpretation of the provisions of the zoning code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of the zoning code; 
(3)  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
(4)  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the zoning code to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; 
(5)  The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning code; 
(6)  The granting of the variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Development Plan; 
(7)  The granting of the variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate specific written conditions and safeguards in conformity with the zoning code. Under no circumstance shall the board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of the zoning code in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the zoning code in said district. 
(c)  Power of administrative official. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of the zoning code, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the zoning administrator from whom the appeal is taken. 
(Ord. No. 964, § 2, 1-25-99) 
Sec. 4.7-6. - Appeals; final disposition. 
(a)  Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, or bureau of the city jointly or severally aggrieved by any variance decision of the board of zoning adjustment may petition the Orange County Circuit Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision by the board. The petition must be filed with the clerk of the circuit court within thirty (30) days of the determination of the board, in accordance with applicable laws of the State of Florida and the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
(b)  Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, or bureau of the city jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning adjustment regarding an appeal of any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the administration or enforcement of the zoning code may appeal said decision directly to city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the rendition of the board's decision. A hearing before city council on the appeal will then be scheduled and placed on a future city council meeting agenda. 
(c)  Any person or persons or taxpayer of the city jointly or severally aggrieved by the city council's decision on such appeal may petition the Orange County Circuit Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision. The petition must be filed with the clerk of the circuit court within thirty (30) days of the determination of the city council, in accordance with applicable laws of the State of Florida and the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

(Ord. No. 1163, § 2, 3-10-08) 
Editor's note- See the editor's note to Art. III of this chapter. 
Sec. 4.7-11. - General functions, powers and duties. 
(a)  Violation of city codes and ordinances. A code enforcement board and a special magistrate shall have the jurisdiction to hear and decide alleged violations of any codes and ordinances of the city. A code enforcement board or special magistrate, however, is an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance with these codes and ordinances. Nothing shall prohibit the city council from enforcing its codes and ordinances by any other means. 
In its administration of this function, a code enforcement board and a special magistrate shall have the power to subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to any hearing, which subpoenas shall be served by the Maitland police department; subpoena records, surveys, plats and other documentary evidence, which subpoenas shall be served by the Maitland police department; take testimony under oath; and issue orders having the force and effect of law, commanding whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(b)  Levy fines and penalties. Upon notification by the chief code enforcement officer that a previous order of the board has not been complied with by the set time, a code enforcement board or special magistrate may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for each day the violation continues past the date set by the board's order for compliance, in addition to administrative costs and fees. For repeat violations, a code enforcement board or special magistrate may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day the violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector, in addition to administrative costs and fees. For violations found to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, a code enforcement board or special magistrate may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. In addition, if the violation is found to present a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall notify the city council, which may make reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance, and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed, consistent with this section and Florida State Statutes. 
A certified copy of any order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of Orange County, Florida, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as court judgment by the sheriffs of the State of Florida, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code enforcement board or special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. 
No lien provided by this chapter shall continue for a period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien, and these costs shall be applied automatically to the total fine collected. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

(l)  Regulate signs in a manner that will not interfere with or obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(m)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(n)  Preserve, conserve, protect and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of the city;

ARTICLE VII. - BUILDING NUMBERS AND STREET NAMES[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1268, § 1, adopted January 12, 2015 , amended § 5-104 of former Art. VI of this chapter. Because former Art. VI was amended in its entirety by another ordinance and in order to group similar subject matter together, the editor has included the provisions of Ord. No. 1268 as Art. VII, § 5-151 as herein set out. 

Sec. 5-151. - Numbering of buildings and naming of streets. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article shall be to require the display of building numbers visible from public or private streets for all properties that contain buildings, as defined by the Florida Building Code, within the city. For properties that also front on waterways, the display of numbers visible from said waterway shall also be required. This section also provides for the assignment of address numbers to buildings and structures and naming of streets. This requirement is established to assist the general public or city personnel in identifying any property in case of an emergency, as well as for the general welfare of the public in conducting normal affairs. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following words, terms and phrases shall be defined as follows: 
    Accessory building means a building which is clearly incidental or subordinate to and customarily utilized adjacent to and in connection with a principal building located on the same parcel. 
    Building shall mean any permanent structure designed or built for the support, enclosure, shelter or protection of persons, animals, chattel or property of any kind, including residential, commercial and industrial buildings, but excluding accessory buildings. 
    Building front means that side of a building which faces the public or private road, street, or way pursuant to which the building is numbered. When a building is constructed on a corner lot, the building front shall be that area of the building which faces the public or private road, street, or way on which a projected address is assigned, or, if a projected address has not been assigned, the area so designed by the street naming and numbering agency.

ARTICLE I. - FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 6.5-1. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Maitland are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 1192, § 2, 10-12-09) 
Sec. 6.5-2. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to save lives, promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to life, health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  Preserve the integrity of the city's lakes and water bodies, aquifer, and any other natural resource deemed necessary within the conservation element of the city's adopted comprehensive development plan. 
(Ord. No. 1192, § 2, 10-12-09) 
Sec. 6.5-3. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, health and to eliminate or minimize property damage; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and culverts located in floodplains; 
(6)  Maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area. 
(8)  To protect the aquifer and surface water bodies in the city.

Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the board of adjustments and appeal's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This term is synonymous with the phrase "special flood hazard area."

    Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building -see "structure." 
    Datum. A reference surface used to ensure that all elevation records are properly related. The current national datum is the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, which is expressed in relation to mean sea level, or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment.

This term may also be referred to as "existing structures". 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 5, 1979. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means: 
(a)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surface of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(b)  It also means the collapse or subsidence of land along a shore of a lake or other body of water as the result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which result sin flooding as defined in paragraph (a) (1) of this definition. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map of the community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of special flood hazard and regulatory floodways.

    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by FEMA, which delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official hydrology and hydraulics report provided by FEMA. The study contains an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and other flood-related erosion hazards. The study may also contain flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FHBM (where applicable), and other related data and information. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations of the community. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, State of Florida, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway -see "regulatory floodway." 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the one-percent (base or 100-year) floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Freeboard means the additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet, above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors, such as wave action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed, which could contribute to flood heights greater than the heights calculated for a selected frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Hardship as related to variances from this chapter means the exceptional difficulty associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The community requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is; 
(a)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register: 
(b)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district: 
(c)  Individually listed on the Florida inventory of historic places, which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(d)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
(1)  By an approved Florida program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(2)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after the completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design standards of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, which is the property value excluding the land value and that of the detached accessory structures and other improvements on site (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller) as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by an independent certified appraisal (other than a limited or curbside appraisal, or one based on income approach), Actual cash value (replacement cost depreciated for age and quality of construction of building), or adjusted tax-assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this ordinance, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after September 5, 1979 (see the comment in definition for "Existing construction). The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For flood insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after September 5, 1979 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the first floodplain management code, ordinance or standard. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Principally above ground means that at least 51 percent of the actual cash value of the structure is above ground. 
    Program deficiency means a defect in the community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations or of the standards required by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to safety or health of the entire community or a neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means base flood waters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the SFHA and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis; 
(b)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(c)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Remedy a deficiency or violation means to bring the regulation, procedure, structure or other development into compliance with State of Florida, federal, or local floodplain management regulations; or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways the impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Shallow flooding -see "area of shallow flooding." 
    Special flood hazard area -see "area of special flood hazard." 
    Start of construction means, for other than new construction and substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P. L. 97-348, includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eigthty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Storm cellar means a place below grade used to accommodate occupants of the structure and emergency supplies as a means of temporary shelter against severe tornadoes or similar windstorm activity. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State of Florida or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for permit for improvement, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. This term does not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of lacustrine or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 1192, § 2, 10-12-09) 
Sec. 6.5-27. - Specific standards. 
    In all A-Zones where base flood elevation data have been provided (Zones AE, A1-30, A (with base flood elevation), and AH), as set forth in section 6.5-6, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article III, section 6.5-26, shall apply: 
(1)  Residential construction. All new construction and substantial improvement of any residential building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, there must be a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of flood hydrostatic forces in accordance with standards of Article III, section 6.5-27(3). 
(2)  Non-residential construction. All new construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than two (2) foot above the base flood elevation. structures located in A-Zones may be flood-proofed, in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the components, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, below the base flood elevation plus two foot are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied using the FEMA floodproofing certificate. Such certification along with the corresponding engineering data, and the operational and maintenance plans shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 6.5-17. 
(3)  Enclosures below the lowest floor. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above adjacent interior grade (which must be equal to or higher in elevation than the adjacent exterior grade); and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they provide the required net area of the openings and permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation; 
c.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, storage, and building access. Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
d.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
(4)  Setbacks. 
a.  Single family residential: No building or structure, except swimming pools, boathouses, or docks may be erected within fifty (50) feet of a controlled water elevation of any lake. For swimming pools located closer than fifty (50) feet to the controlled water elevation, the screen enclosure height shall not exceed twelve (12) feet, consistent with Chapter 21 of the City Code of Ordinances. Likewise, no boathouse or dock may be constructed or maintained so as to create a hazard to boats or other watercraft in the water. 
b.  All other land uses: No impervious surface area, excluding decking, may be erected within fifty (50) feet of a controlled water elevation of any lake or canal. 
(5)  Special environmental protection. Areas of special flood hazard adjacent to Lake Lucien and Howell Creek are established in section 6.5-5. Since these areas exist substantially in a natural state and restriction of further encroachment and reduction of the flood capacity in these areas by development can prevent costly flooding and other environmental damage, the following provision shall apply: Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development shall be prohibited. 
(6)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes that are placed, or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, on sites (i) outside of an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, the lowest floor be elevated on a permanent foundation to no lower than the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph 4.a of this section, must be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the grade and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  All recreational vehicles must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation standards in accordance with section 6.5-27. 
(7)  Adequate drainage paths. Adequate drainage paths around structures shall be provided on slopes to guide water away from structures within Zone AH. 
(8)  Standards for waterways with established base flood elevations, but without regulatory floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 6.5-6, where streams exist for which base flood elevation data has been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency without the delineation of the regulatory floodway (Zones AE and A1-30), the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in section 6.5-27 shall apply: 
a.  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development including fill shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
b.  Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies-with the community's endorsement-for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(9)  Standards for waterways with established base flood elevations and floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 6.5-6, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the high velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and have significant erosion potential, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in section 6.5-27 shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments within the regulatory floodway unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice demonstrating that encroachments would not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  Development activities including new construction and substantial improvements within the regulatory floodway that increase the base flood elevation may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies-with the community's endorsement-for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of FEMA. 
c.  When fill is proposed, in accordance with the permit issued by the Florida Department of Health, within the regulatory floodway, the development permit shall be issued only upon demonstration by appropriate engineering analyses that the proposed fill will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood in accordance with section 6.5-27. 
(Ord. No. 1192, § 2, 10-12-09; Ord. No. 1266, § 1, 11-10-14 ) 
Sec. 6.5-28. - Specific standards for a-zones without base flood elevations and regulatory floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 6.5-6, where there exist A Zones for which no base flood elevation data and regulatory floodway have been provided or designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Require standards of section 6.5-26. 
(2)  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data.

The studies must be provided in a form established by the community development department. The analysis must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
(e)  A shared parking plan shall be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record and shall be subject to approval by the city. The owner(s) shall agree to bear the expense of recording the agreement, and such agreement shall bind owners and their heirs, successors, and assigns. An attested copy of the agreement between the owner(s) of record shall be submitted to the community development department. Recordation of the agreement must take place before issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for any use to be served by the shared parking area. 
(f)  When the uses or the property subject to shared parking agreement are proposed to change, the community development director or designee shall have the authority to require a revised shared parking study and shall, with the approval of the development review committee, either revoke the shared parking agreement when it is determined that it is no longer necessary to meet the parking requirements of the uses or shall require a new shared parking agreement, when the revised parking study indicates additional parking is required. 
(g)  The community development director or designee may reevaluate a parking agreement previously approved by the city under the following circumstances: 
1.  Expiration of the agreement; 
2.  When there is proposed revision to the use or property that would require additional parking under the Maitland City Code regulating parking such as, an increase in square footage of structures/buildings affected by the agreement, or increased seating, or employee counts for restaurants; or

(Ord. No. 1224, § 1(Exh. A), 2-13-12) 
Sec. 7.5-43. - Procedure for minor amendments to a development agreement. 
(I)  Review and approval by community development director. 
(a)  Minor amendments to a development agreement may be approved as a non-statutory development agreement pursuant to the city's home rule powers under the Florida Constitution and Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, after review by the community development director, provided: 
(1)  The change is substantially consistent with the overall purposes and intent of the approved development agreement; and 
(2)  The change conforms to all other applicable city ordinances and regulations; and 
(3)  The change does not require a change in any other provision of the development agreement that would require review under section 7.5-42; and 
(4)  The change is not inconsistent with the city's comprehensive development plan. 
(b)  An amendment is considered minor if it includes one or more of the following: 
(1)  Adds less than five (5) percent of the approximate structural square footage of the project, if the development agreement states an approximate maximum square footage of the project. 
(2)  Changes provisions regarding easements or utilities so that more effective service levels can be achieved. 
(3)  Corrects any scriveners' errors. 
(4)  Changes provisions which are specifically provided for as minor in the approved development agreement. 
(5)  Change time frames for development application review, as long as the modified schedule does not trigger any default dates that may exist within the agreement and the modified review time frames and all required improvements, can be accomplished without an extension of the expiration date of the agreement. 
(6)  Changes resulting from changes to any section or subsection numbers of amended Florida Statutes, Florida Administrative Code, or any other state or local law, so long as the substance of the state or local law has not changed. 
(7)  When the development agreement provides that a city official take certain action, the change adds that the city official "or his or her designee" may execute the action. 
(8)  Changes provisions that allow administrative site plan reviews by providing that site plan reviews shall be processed in accordance with Article X of Chapter 7.5. 
(9)  Extends the effective date of a current, unexpired development agreement if state law applicable to the development agreement requires such extension, so long as the developer follows the requirements of the law. 
(10)  When a development agreement requires a letter of credit or maintenance bond, the change allows other forms of security interest, so long as any surety is approved by the city staff; provided, however, that any stated amount or percentage of the security interest remains the same. 
(11)  Changes the corporate name or address of developer when such changes have been accomplished through the state. 
(12)  Changes the name of the subject property or project, unless the name of the subject property listed in the development agreement is the same as an already-platted subdivision. 
(II)  Development review committee review and recommendation. If the Community Development Director desires review and recommendation by the DRC for a determination of whether the change is minor, (s)he may require DRC to review the proposed change. The DRC shall recommend approval or denial that the change is minor. 
(III)  Decision of community development director. If the community development director determines, when applying the above criteria, that the change is minor, the amendment shall be prepared, executed, and recorded in the public records of Orange County, without necessity of any public hearings before the LPA or city council. If the community development director determines that the change is not minor, (s)he shall state reasons in writing to the applicant, and the amendment shall be reviewed in accordance with section 7.5-42.

    The development agreement may be revoked or modified by the City of Maitland in accordance with Section 163.3235, Florida Statutes, or canceled at any time in accordance with Section 163.3237, Florida Statutes; or revoked in accordance with Section 163.3241, Florida Statutes.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Oct. 24, 2011, amended former Art. VII, §§ 7.5-50-7.5-58, to read as herein set out. Former Art. VII pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 771, § 2, adopted April 22, 1991. 

Sec. 7.5-50. - Purpose and intent. 
    The planned development review process established in this article is intended to implement zoning amendment requests for planned developments consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and zoning regulations. The procedures will provide efficient review of zoning amendment requests for the planned development district, with particular attention to levels of service established in the city's comprehensive plan and design and performance criteria established by the city to guide development. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-51. - Applicability. 
    The procedures contained in this article are applicable to all zoning amendment requests for the planned development zoning district. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, erect or alter a building or structure or to develop, change or improve land or to change the use for which an approved final development plan is required by this article, except in accordance with an approved final development plan. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-52. - Schedule of fees. 
    The city council shall establish, by resolution, a schedule of fees, charges and expenses for administering this article. Until all applicable fees, charges and expenses have been paid, no action shall be taken on any planned development application. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-53. - Planned development application procedures. 
(I)  Pre-application conference. Before submitting an application, the applicant shall schedule a pre-application conference with the Development Review Committee, to review the proposed development. The applicant shall obtain a copy of the pre-application form from the Community Development Department. The city shall provide written comments to the applicant prior to the Development Review Committee pre-application meeting. 
    The pre-application process serves as an opportunity to examine ideas and share information between the City of Maitland and an applicant for a potential development project, in a conceptual application format. The comments and information provided by the city do not constitute a waiver of any requirements contained in the city's Land Development Code; but are meant to assist in the preparation of the application for formal submittal. A pre-application conference must be held no more than six (6) months prior to filing an application for planned development. 
    Following the pre-application conference, the applicant may submit an application for a planned development which consists of a development plan submittal as well as a zoning amendment. The applicant shall submit the application and supplemental materials to the community development department in quantities designated by the city. 
    Applicants are encouraged to meet with neighborhoods and surrounding property owners/residents prior to formal submittal of an application for planned development to discuss plans for the property that will be subject to the PD zoning and to be able to understand and respond to any valid concerns via design modifications. 
    The application for planned development provides two (2) options to proceed through the application process. They are Option 1 and Option 2. 
    The Option 1 application for planned development provides the opportunity to proceed through the planned development review process and obtain rezoning and development plan approval, but does not require final development plan level information, such as final engineering and final storm water calculations, during this stage of the application process. Selecting Option 1 will not result in a waiver of any requirement stated within the Land Development Code; rather it allows the information to be submitted as part of the site plan review process following city council approval of the planned development application. 
    After the city council has approved the planned development application, the applicant must submit an application for site plan review, pursuant to section 7.5-83(II) of the Maitland City Code, to the development review committee for an administrative review. The site plan review process will require submittal of final engineering and final storm water calculations as well as other detailed application materials necessary to complete the city's technical review of the application and obtain final site plan approval. 
    The Option 2 process allows the applicant to choose to submit final development plan application review materials, including items such as final engineering and sealed and engineered final storm water calculations, listed in section 7.5-56 of the Maitland City Code. Option 2 does not require the SITE PLAN review submittal because final development plan (site plan) review materials are included in this review. 
    Both Option 1 and Option 2 will require the public hearing and public notification processes outlined in section 7.5-53(III) of the Maitland City Code. 
(II)  Sufficiency review for zoning amendment and planned development. All applications for a zoning amendment to a planned development district shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. Applications must be submitted no later than 12:00 noon at least forty (40) days prior to the first or 3rd Thursday of any month. The zoning administrator will review the application for sufficiency and completeness of information within five (5) working days after submission. If corrections are requested, the applicant shall have five (5) working days to make all requested changes. Incomplete applications will not be processed. 
(III)  Notice of planning and zoning commission hearing. After receipt of a complete petition, the city shall give notice in a newspaper of general circulation, as defined in Florida Statutes, at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the planning and zoning commission public hearing date on which the petition is to be heard. Notice shall be posted on the property subject to the petition and in two (2) public places, as well as the city web site. Notice shall be sent by first class regular United States mail to property owners within five hundred (500) feet of the subject property. The distance shall be measured by a straight line from the point on the boundary of the property subject to the planned development zoning amendment petition nearest to the point of the boundary of any surrounding property. Notice shall be deemed to have been delivered when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, and addressed to the property owner whose name is shown on the most current tax roll in Orange County or Seminole County. 
    All notices referenced in the above paragraph shall include: 
(a)  A statement that the planned development zoning district classification has been requested for the property; 
(b)  The legal description of the property subject to the petition and a general location map to correspond with the legal description of the property as noted on the hearing notice. This does not mandate publication of the location map in the newspaper noted above unless otherwise required by Florida Statutes. 
(c)  The name of the owner(s) of the property subject to the petition; 
(d)  That a public hearing will be held by the planning and zoning commission; 
(e)  The date, time, and location of the hearing; 
(f)  Advise that the public is invited to attend the hearing and make comment orally or in writing; and 
(g)  The location and times during which an interested party may inspect the petition. 
(IV)  Planning and zoning commission public hearing. The planning and zoning commission public hearing shall be held on the first or third Thursday of the month. Any party may appear in person, or by agent or by attorney to discuss and/or comment on the petition. 
    Following the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission has the option to: 
(a)  Provide an additional review of the application by the planning and zoning commission to finalize its review comments; or 
(b)  Forward its comments to the city council without further review by the planning and zoning commission. 
    In either case, before any recommendation is forwarded to city council, the planning and zoning commission shall make a written finding, certifying consistency with the comprehensive development plan, and finding that satisfactory provision and arrangements have been made concerning the factors itemized for development review committee review. 
    The written finding shall also certify compliance with the specific rules governing planned developments as may be applicable to the application under review. 
(a)  If the planning and zoning commission chooses to review the application again; it shall declare at the public hearing that the application shall be returned following the development review committee's action on the application. After its review is complete, the planning and zoning commission shall forward a recommendation to the city council (including any conditions and findings) for approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the application. 
(b)  The planning and zoning commission may choose to provide a recommendation directly to the city council. In such cases, the planning and zoning commission shall forward instructions to the development review committee regarding the development of detailed conditions to include in the findings and recommendation being forwarded to the city council. The development review committee will then finalize the recommendation for consideration by the city council, unless the development review committee recommendation is contrary to that of the planning and zoning commission recommendation. In this case, the development review committee shall return the recommendation to the planning and zoning commission for finalization. 
(V)  Review by development review committee. Following a public hearing by the planning and zoning commission the development review committee shall review the petition and any testimony that was made at the hearing and shall provide reasonable assistance to the applicant to bring the project in compliance with the Land Development Code and other applicable regulations and agreements. The applicant may continue to work with development review committee until such time that the development review committee determines the proposal is consistent with all applicable regulations and the item is ready to be placed on the next practical planning and zoning commission or city council agenda, if the streamline approach is taken pursuant to 7.5-53.(IV). Should the applicant determine they no longer desire to work with development review committee to resolve the items, the applicant may choose to proceed to the next required planning and zoning commission or city council meeting, where staff shall advise of the applicant's decision to proceed without completing modifications required by development review committee. In all cases, the development review committee will generate and forward a written recommendation that will accompany the petition to the next step of the review process. The development review committee shall make a recommendation for approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the proposed petition. The development review committee shall formulate its recommendation and make findings with regard to the following factors: 
(a)  Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety, connectivity and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or catastrophe; 
(b)  Off-street parking and loading areas, where required, with particular attention to the items in (a) above;

(i)  Whether there is compliance with the applicable ordinances and regulations for the proposed development; where compliance is not achieved, whether the development adversely impacts adjacent and surrounding properties and unduly burdens city operations and facilities; 
(j)  Whether the proposed development will lower the applicable levels of service below the levels adopted in the city's comprehensive development plan, and whether the proposed development is phased to be constructed at a time when the adopted service levels are met; 
(k)  Whether the time frames proposed for development are consistent with requirements of the comprehensive plan and other applicable regulations; 
(l)  Whether the phase of development in question can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of substantial desirability and stability; 
(m)  Whether there is substantial compliance with the purpose and intent of the planned development district; 
(n)  Reserved. 
(o)  Whether off-site credits (incentives) proposed (if any) have been satisfactorily addressed, if applicable; 
(p)  Whether mobility strategies for a transportation concurrency exception area (TCEA) are required and have been satisfactorily addressed, if applicable; 
(q)  Whether the existing or proposed utility services and transportation systems are adequate for the proposed development; whether all adopted levels of service have been or will be adequately met; and 
(r)  Whether the proposed development plan is consistent with the comprehensive development plan.

For any allocation less than fifty (50) percent of the ground floor square footage of a building or development site, approval may only be granted based upon evidence that an allocation of fifty (50) percent or greater of the ground floor square footage as retail, office and/or other commercial uses would not be viable use within the development and evidence that the proposed allocation of residential uses will further the objectives and purposes of the Packwood District described in section 21-21 and section 23-3 of the Maitland City Code. However, in no case shall ground floor commercial square footage be approved at less than twenty-five (25) percent of a building or development site.

Substantial deviation shall mean a change to an accepted overall development plan and development order which creates a reasonable likelihood of adverse impact to any portion of the project devoted to a specific use or to adjacent properties. Any decision rendered by the development review committee may be appealed to the city council within thirty (30) days of the date that the decision is rendered. 
    However, following consideration of the proposed revision, should the development review committee determine the change does not qualify as a minor revision, then the revision(s) shall be forwarded to the planning and zoning commission and city council for final approval.

ARTICLE IX. - ROAD ACCESS TO STATE ROADS 

Sec. 7.5-70. - Purpose and intent. 
    The Florida Legislature has passed 335.18 through 335.188, Florida Statutes, the "State Highway System Access Management Act," which expresses the legislative intent that local governments assert an active role, in cooperation with the Florida Department of Transportation, in planning and controlling access to the Florida State Highway System. 
    In addition, the State Highway System Access Management Act authorizes local governments to require access permits from persons seeking to install additional connections to the state highway system within such local government's jurisdiction, including the responsibility to develop access-permitting standards and to grant or deny access permit applications. 
    Therefore, the city has determined that municipal regulation of connections to the public streets, roads and other rights-of-way within the city would greatly promote the public welfare and safety, assist in coordinating land use planning decisions, and aid in reducing the city's traffic congestion problem. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 2, 4-22-91) 
Sec. 7.5-71. - Applicability. 
    Any person, firm or entity, including a governmental entity other than the city, seeking to connect, alter or improve access to the state highway system within the city must first apply for and receive an access permit from the city. Such access permit shall be in addition to any permit required by the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT) as a prerequisite to connection to the State Highway System, and receipt of an access permit from the city neither relieves the recipient from the necessity to obtain a permit from DOT nor guarantees the right to connect to the state highway system. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 2, 4-22-91) 
Sec. 7.5-72. - Schedule of fees. 
    The application shall be accompanied by payment to the city of an application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Until this fee has been paid, no action shall be taken on any application. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 2, 4-22-91)

Such application in conjunction with properly identified exhibits and supporting materials must be supplied in quantities as specified by the public works director on the application and shall clearly indicate the following: 
(a)  Completed application form for access permit. A completed application form for access permit, with the name, address and telephone number of applicant(s), property owner(s), and agent(s) statement indicating request, and appropriate signatures. If ownership of any part of or all of the real property subject to the petition shall change during the pendency of the petition, the petitioning owner who has conveyed such parcel of real property shall be required to immediately advise the public works department in writing. Any desire to amend or withdraw application must be submitted in writing to the public works department. 
(b)  Fees. The payment of all appropriate processing fees and charges, as set from time to time. 
(c)  Applicant authorization. If the applicant or agent is other than the property owner, the applicant shall provide a notarized letter of authorization from the property owner. 
(d)  Supplemental information. 
1.  Legal description or street address of the parcel of land on which the improvement is proposed to be placed as well as a statement of all persons owning any legal or beneficial rights in such land. 
2.  Vicinity map.

3.  Construction details. A statement as to what construction materials will be used in the improvement including an estimate of the duration of such construction. 
4.  Level of service data and analysis. A statement as to what type of vehicular use the improvement will be put, including estimates of average and peak vehicle trips per day over such improvement, an assessment of the resulting effects on the level of service for the roadway and the two (2) closest intersections, and the increase if any to average or peak hour vehicle trips per day over the road to which the improvement gives access. 
(II)  For the purpose of administering this section, the word "improvements" shall mean "any roadway which is a part of the state highway system within the city, whether or not publicly dedicated, for any purpose related to widening or repairing existing access". This definition is intended to include all improvements of every kind to roadways and adjacent real property which could in any way affect traffic volumes on the state highway system within the city, and should be read broadly so as to effectuate that intent. 
(III)  Following submission of the application for access permit, the director of public works (director) shall have a period of not more than ninety (90) days for staff review of the proposed connection. Should the department of public works (the department) determine that a longer review period is required to thoroughly assess the probable impact of the proposed connection upon the city, the director shall notify the applicant at least fourteen (14) business days before the expiration of the aforementioned ninety-day period that extended review will be necessary. The department shall evaluate the proposed connection in light of its probable effects upon the state highway system, traffic flow and vehicular congestion, public safety, quality of life and the natural environment within the city. 
(IV)  The following are hereby adopted as minimum standards for the department to use in evaluating access permit applications, and the department is hereby authorized to adopt such further standards as it finds necessary to achieve the ends expressed in section 7.5-72 above: 
(a)  The standards contained in the comprehensive plan for the city. 
(b)  The standards contained in the DOT manual, "Policy and Guidelines for Vehicular Connections to the State Highway System." 
(c)  The standards contained in Florida Administrative Code Rule 9J-2.055 for measuring traffic volume; specifically, "level of service" as defined in F.A.C. Rule 9J-02.055(3)(e) and "peak hour vehicle trips" by which such levels of service are computed. The department shall deny a permit for any improvement which the department estimates will result in either (1) a ten-percent or greater increase in average or peak vehicle trips per day, or (2) reduction of the level of service of the roadway to which an applicant desires to make an improvement. 
(V)  If the director finds that the proposed access will meet the requirements of this article, he shall issue a permit therefor. The director is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued by him pursuant to this article, upon the failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provision of the article. Any decision or action made or taken by the director pursuant to this article may be appealed in writing to the city council within thirty (30) days after any such decision or action.

Substantial deviation shall mean a change to an accepted overall development plan and development order which creates a reasonable likelihood of adverse impact to any portion of the project devoted to a specific use or to adjacent properties. Any decision rendered by the development review committee may be appealed to the city council within thirty (30) days of the date that the decision is rendered. 
    Should the development review committee determine that a proposed change is not substantially consistent with the approved development order, the development review committee in its sole discretion, may choose to forward a revision to the planning and zoning commission for review. The development review committee's determination to forward a revision to the planning and zoning commission may be based on a finding of inconsistency with approved design standards or specifications, incompatibility with the CDP, substantial deviation from the approved plan or for any other reason determined by the development review committee to require planning and zoning commission review. 
    Any decision rendered by the planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the city council within thirty (30) days of the date that the decision is rendered.

ARTICLE XI. - SUBDIVISION PROCESS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Oct. 24, 2011, amended former Art. XI, §§ 7.5-90-7.5-100, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XI pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 771, § 2, April 22, 1991; Ord. No. 995, § 73, March 27, 2000. 
Cross reference- Subdivision of land generally, Ch. 16. 

Sec. 7.5-90. - Purpose and intent. 
    Land subdivision is the first step in community development. Once land has been subdivided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads, drainage and utilities must be maintained and various customary municipal services must be provided. The welfare of the entire city is directly affected by land subdivision. It is to the interest of all taxpayers and citizens, the developer and future residents that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound practice and appropriate standards. 
    The intent and purpose of these regulations is to provide for the harmonious development of the city; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic; and to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, potable water, flood prevention drainage, sewers, and other sanitary facilities and city services. 
    In addition to the minimum requirements for construction of such improvements as roads and drainage, compliance with the intent of these regulations requires that good design be practiced in subdivision planning, valuable and scenic natural features conserved and adequate open space be made available for public use. Subdivision design should be adapted to the peculiarities and opportunities of the site should utilize contemporary, imaginative design and should avoid monotonous repetition of a wasteful pattern of gridiron layouts and long, straight minor or collector streets. Size, shape and orientation of lots and blocks should be carefully considered with relation to future use of the various lots to be created. 
    It is intended that this article shall be construed liberally in the favor of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-91. - Applicability. 
    The regulations established in this article shall apply to all lands presently within the limits of the city and to any lands which may in the future be annexed to and be made a part of the city. No land shall be subdivided unless such subdivision conforms to the provisions of this article and all other applicable regulations in the city. In order to subdivide land and file a plat thereon, except merely to record the boundaries of an ownership, all requirements as set out in this article shall be met and the procedures as herein set forth shall be followed. More specifically, anyone seeking the division of land into two (2) or more lots in the city shall be required to follow the procedures established by this article. The sale or exchange of small parcels of land to or between adjoining property owners where such sale or exchange does not create additional lots shall not be considered a subdivision of land required to adhere to these procedures. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-92. - Schedule of fees. 
    The city council shall establish, by resolution, a schedule of fees, charges, expenses, and a collection process for administering this article. Until all applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid, no action shall be taken on any application. 
(Ord. No. 1219, § 1(Exh. A), 10-24-11) 
Sec. 7.5-93. - Subdivision application procedures. 
    Pre-application conference. Before submitting an application, an applicant for subdivision approval shall schedule a pre-application conference with the development review committee, to review the proposed development. The applicant shall obtain a copy of the pre-application form from the community development department. The city shall provide written comments to the applicant prior to the development review committee pre-application meeting. 
    The pre-application process serves as an opportunity to examine ideas and share information between the City of Maitland and an applicant for a potential subdivision in a conceptual application format. The comments and information provided by the city shall not be considered to constitute a waiver of any requirements contained in the City's Land Development Code but are meant to assist in the preparation of the application for formal submittal. A pre-application conference must be held no more than six (6) months prior to filing an application for planned development. 
    Following the pre-application conference, the applicant may submit an application for a subdivision plat as applicable in this article. The applicant shall submit the application and supplemental materials to the community development department in quantities designated by the city. 
    Applicants are encouraged to meet with neighborhoods and surrounding property owners/residents to discuss plans for the property that will be subject to the subdivision plat application, to be able to understand and respond to any valid concerns. 
    Applicants may apply for subdivision plat and planned development (PD) approval at the same time, in which case the city may undertake concurrent review of both applications. Applicants choosing the Option-1 PD process shall follow the preliminary and final subdivision processes described within section. 7.5-93, unless submitting a lot split or minor subdivision plat, in which case the applicant shall follow those processes accordingly. 
    Applicants selecting Option 2-PD, outlined in section 7.5-53 shall follow the process listed in section 7.5-95, Minor subdivision approval. 
    If the proposed subdivision is to be a large one and the developer plans to construct it in phases, the nature and extent of such phases shall be clearly delineated, and the developer must show the full extent of his development and submit, for the entire development, plans and data as required by this article. 
Preliminary Subdivision Plan 
(I)  Sufficiency review generally. All applications shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. Applications must be submitted at least forty (40) days prior to the first or third Thursday of any month in which the petitioner desires the application to be heard. The zoning administrator will review the application for sufficiency and completeness of information within five (5) working days after submission. If corrections are requested, the applicant shall have five (5) working days to make all requested changes. Incomplete applications will not be accepted. 
(II)  Notice of planning and zoning commission hearing. After receipt of a complete petition, the city shall give notice in a newspaper of general circulation, as defined in Florida Statutes, at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the planning and zoning commission public hearing date on which the petition is to be heard.

Should the applicant determine they no longer desire to work with development review committee to resolve the items, the applicant may choose to proceed to the next required planning and zoning commission or city council meeting, where staff shall advise of the applicant's decision to proceed without completing modifications required by development review committee. In all cases, the development review committee will generate and forward a written recommendation that will accompany the petition to the next step of the review process. The development review committee shall make a recommendation for approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the proposed petition. The development review committee shall formulate its recommendation and make findings with regard to the following factors: 
(a)  Whether the proposed subdivision is in compliance with the applicable ordinances and regulations for the property on which it is proposed;

    The planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval of the preliminary plan and other supplementary materials as presented, or shall recommend approval with modifications, or shall recommend denial of the preliminary plan and required improvements. 
    City council decision. At a regularly scheduled meeting, the city council shall receive and review the planning and zoning commission recommendation and shall accept, accept with modifications, or reject the preliminary subdivision plan. Failure to comply with the provisions of these regulations and other applicable statutes and ordinances shall be cause for refusing to approve the preliminary plan. 
    Action by the city council to approve or to approve with conditions, or to deny an application shall be deemed final. Any person aggrieved by action of the city council may seek recourse to the courts as provided by the laws of Florida. 
    Acceptance of the preliminary plan and other required supplementary material shall not be construed as acceptance of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of acceptance of the layout submitted and preliminary engineering and planning on the preliminary plan as a guide to the preparations of the final plat. 
    (VI) Time limit for submission of final subdivision plat. The final subdivision plat and supplementary material must be submitted within twelve (12) months after approval of the preliminary plat in accordance with the requirements of this article and all other applicable regulations.

Sec. 7.5-94. - Determination of substantial conformity for final plat and revisions to construction drawings. 
    A final plat will be considered in substantial conformity to the approved preliminary plan and construction drawings if it reflects the preliminary plan and modifications approved by the planning and zoning commission and city council. 
    Minor changes to an approved preliminary plan and/or construction drawings may be permitted after review and approval by the community development director or designee and may be considered in substantial conformity as well, provided the changes are consistent with the comprehensive plan and conform to all other applicable ordinances and regulations. Minor changes may include the following: 
(a)  Realignment of an internal roadway or curb cut to improve traffic flow, turn movements or other safety considerations. 
(b)  Relocate parking or retention areas within the site to increase percolation or reduce runoff from the site (over and above the approved site plan). 
(c)  Add or delete less than five (5) percent of the square footage of any lot for the project or add or delete less than five (5) percent of street frontage or lot width for any lot of the project. 
(d)  Decrease density, height, intensity or permeable surface coverage. 
(e)  Realignment of an approved wall or fence, to avoid existing trees or attempt to resolve a problem peculiar to the site. 
(f)  Relocate easements or utilities to provide more effective service levels. 
(g)  Amend sign package provided it does not increase in sign area by more than ten (10) percent. 
    The community development director may, at his sole discretion, pass any of the items (a) through (g) onto the development review committee for their consideration. 
    All changes not specifically listed in this section may be considered and approved by the development review committee as a minor change(s) if determined by the development review committee in a regularly scheduled meeting to be substantially consistent with the approved preliminary subdivision plan development order. Any decision rendered by the development review committee may be appealed to the city council within thirty (30) days of the date that the decision is rendered. 
    If the development review committee determines that the plat does not meet all requirements, the applicant may submit, within sixty (60) days, a revised final plat to address the concerns of the DRC and meet the requirements without an additional fee for review. Thereafter, re-submittals will require an additional final plat fee. Deadlines may be extended by the development review committee upon receipt of a written request prior to expiration of the sixty-day re-submittal time frame. 
    All changes determined to be major changes must be approved through procedures specified for a preliminary subdivision plan process. 
    If the plat complies with all requirements, it shall be presented to the city council within thirty (30) days of determination of compliance. 
(I)  City council acceptance of final plat. At a regularly scheduled meeting, the city council shall accept or reject the final subdivision plat. Failure to comply with the provisions of these regulations and other applicable statutes and ordinances shall be cause for refusing to accept the final plat. 
(II)  Time limit for recordation and improvements. For construction and installation of municipal improvements, and prior to recording of the final at by the city, the developer shall provide a surety bond to the city issued by a bonding company from the United States Treasury's list of approved bonding companies, or such other guarantee acceptable to the city, that all required work shall be completed in full accordance with the final plat, the approved construction plans and all conditions attached thereto. 
    Approval of the final plat, among other things, shall be contingent upon presentation of the bond or other guarantee acceptable to the city prior to recording of the plat. Construction and installation of municipal improvements shall not commence prior to receipt of this bond or other guarantee by the city. Such bond, referred to as the performance bond, shall be in the amount equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the sum of engineering and construction cost, including landfill, as determined by the construction contract proposal submitted by a properly licensed contractor and confirmed by the city director of public works. 
    All required work shall be completed and ready for acceptance by the city within a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of acceptance of the final plat by city council at its meeting outlined in (I) above. One (1) twelve-month extension may be granted at the discretion of the city council. In order to obtain the extension, the developer shall request it in writing via a letter sent to the zoning administrator at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the plat approval. The performance bond or other guarantee shall remain in force and effect until such time as all required improvements have been accepted by the city. 
    Should the developer fail to provide the necessary bond within the required time period and the plat not be recorded, the plat approval shall be null and void. 
(III)  Required improvements. Approval of the final plat shall be subject to the subdivider having submitted to the city plans and specifications for all improvements required by the city, these plans and specifications being approved by the appropriate city officials prior to commencement of construction and receipt of an acceptable performance bond. A professional engineer registered by the state shall design the required improvements. After required improvements have been constructed, such engineer shall submit certification to the city that the improvements have been constructed according to the approved plans and specifications. 
    Upon completion of all work under bond, the developer shall submit to the city manager or designee a statement certified and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the state stating that the work has been entirely completed, and that it conforms in all respects to the final plat and plans for required improvements and to the specifications set by these regulations. 
    Upon receipt of this certificate of completion, the director of public works shall make a final inspection of each of the contract operations on the site. If the work conforms to all plans and specifications, the city manager shall so inform the city council in writing and recommend acceptance by the city. City council action accepting the improvements shall constitute authority for release of the developer's performance bond. In the event the developer has not completed the construction of all improvements within the authorized time limitations, the city's director of finance shall, when so directed by the city manager, notify the surety company or such other organization furnishing the bond or its equivalent of pending default. 
    Prior to release of the performance bond, the developer shall provide a surety bond issued by a bonding company from the United States Treasury list of approved bonding companies or such other guarantee acceptable to the city in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the sum of the engineering and construction costs. Such bond, referred to as the maintenance bond, shall guarantee that all required improvements dedicated to the city have been properly constructed and are guaranteed for a period of one (1) year.

    All notices referenced in the above paragraph shall include: 
(a)  The name of the appellant;

Before the board may grant a petition for a variance, the board must conclude that all of the following requirements have been met for the application: 
(a)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;

(c)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and 
(d)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this zoning code to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other district shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
    The board of zoning adjustment shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
    The board of zoning adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance: 
(a)  Will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this zoning code; 
(b)  Is consistent with the comprehensive development plan; and 
(c)  Will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

Within forty-five (45) days after the planning and zoning commission's public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall review the development review committee's findings and recommendation and shall make a recommendation to the city council for approval, approval with conditions or denial of the vested rights request.

    The right of the applicant to commence or complete construction of development or of a type, level, nature, density, intensity or other form of development, on his parcel of land, or a portion thereof, is vested, if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city by substantial competent evidence that: 
(a)  The currently effective city comprehensive development plan or portion thereof, or other land development regulation complained of by the applicant as being counter to the applicant's vested right to commence and complete construction of a certain level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development, has a material and adverse effect upon the applicant's vested right to develop the subject parcel of land; 
(b)  By application of the considerations set out in section 7.5-123(IV), hereof, the applicant in good faith and based upon some act or omission of the city has made such substantial change in position or has an investment-backed expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence and complete a certain level, type, nature, density, intensity or other form of development upon all or a portion of the applicant's land; and 
(c)  Requiring the applicant's property be developed in accordance with the current effective city comprehensive development plan or city land development regulation restrictions will, considering the substantial change in position of the applicant or the creation of an investment backed expectation prior to or on the date on which the currently effective city comprehensive development plan or relevant land development regulation was subject to a notice of change in land development regulation, deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on his investment or substantial change in position, or otherwise unjustly deprive the applicant of its vested rights. In determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return, the following categories of expenditures shall not be included in the calculation of the applicant's investment: 
1.  Expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the improvements for the level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development proposed to be vested; 
2.  Expenditures for taxes, except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of a development order which would now be contrary to the currently existing city comprehensive development plan or relevant land development regulation; 
3.  Expenditures which the applicant has allocated to the particular proposed development, but which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as an ordinary and necessary business expense (for example, employees' salaries, equipment rental, chattel mortgage payments) had the plan for the particular development not been formulated or a development order not been issued, for the type, level, nature, density, intensity or other form of development now claimed by the applicant to be vested; 
(d)  The fact that the property has been or is in a zoning or comprehensive planning district or classification under the currently effective city comprehensive development plan or any development regulation, or any prior city comprehensive development plan or zoning ordinance of the city, shall not, in and of itself, establish that an applicant's right to commence and complete construction of a certain level, type, nature, density, intensity, or other form of development has been vested. If it is determined that there is imminent peril to the public health, safety, welfare, general order, economic prosperity, aesthetics, or appearance or that the public cost outweighs the applicant's vested rights, the permit may be denied. 
(VII)  Judicial review. Any person, corporation, partnership or other legal entity aggrieved by a determination to deny, grant, with conditions a vested rights special permit may file a petition for writ of certiorari in the circuit court seeking review. Such petition must be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of rendition of the final order of the city council and pursuant to the requirements of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Whenever the city council has, by amendment, changed the zoning classification of property, the planning and zoning commission shall not consider any petition for rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of the amendatory ordinance. 
    Whenever the planning and zoning commission has taken action to recommend the denial of a petition for the rezoning of property and that recommendation has been approved by the city council, or when the planning and zoning commission has recommended granting a petition for the rezoning of property and the city council has reversed that recommendation and denied the petition, the planning and zoning commission shall not: 
(a)  Consider a petition for any other kind of rezoning on any part of all of the same property for a period of one (1) year from the date of such action.

(Ord. No. 1160, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-143. - Review deposits. 
(a)  Required review deposits. A five thousand-dollar ($5,000.00) review deposit, payable to the City of Maitland by money order, personal or company check or cashier's check drawn on a financial institution authorized to do business in Orange County, Florida, shall be delivered to and collected by the city at the time of submission of each application as defined in Section 7.5-142.

(c)  Waiver of review deposits. In all cases, the city manager may waive the requirement of a review deposit if, based upon information from city staff and the applicant, the amount of the fees, costs and expenses relating to the review, processing, inspection and regulation of such, as estimated by the city manager, will not exceed the application fee. Similarly, should the city manager determine at anytime thereafter, in his sole discretion, that requiring a review deposit is in the city's best interest, he may require one at that time. No review of an application pertaining or relating to subdivision plats, development agreements, planned unit developments, a development of regional impact or such other development-related application as determined by the city manager, shall commence until the Application fee and review deposit, if applicable, is paid. The total development review amount shall be forwarded to the city manager prior to the end of the second business day following the submittal of said application for review or approval. The balance of the review deposit, if any, shall be returned to the applicant as provided for in section 7.5-144. No interest shall be paid to applicant on any review deposit on account with the city. 
(Ord. No. 1160, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-144. - Project account. 
    Once an application pertaining or relating to an application or, upon good cause shown, such other development-related application as determined by the city manager, has been submitted to the city and the applicable total development application fee has been collected, the city manager or his/her designee shall establish an individual project account through which all fees, expenses and costs incurred by the city which are associated with the applicable application will be monitored. The project account will be maintained throughout the entire review, processing, inspection, and regulation process until the latter of: 
(1)  Final action (after all appeal periods have run) by the city council has occurred with respect to the application: 
(2)  No further significant involvement of the city staff or city consultants is expected to occur; 
(3)  The city has been paid all of the amounts due under this section and the city code; or 
(4)  The expiration of any warranty period associated with the conveyance or dedication of improvements to the city. 
    Fees, costs, and expenses for any city consultant time directly related to the review, processing, inspection or regulation of any application or development pursuant to this section, the city code and/or state statutes, and all other directly related expenses, including, but not limited to, advertising, legal, inspection and engineering costs are to be charged to the project account. 
(Ord. No. 1160, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-145. - City invoices. 
(a)  Payment. The city manager or his/her designee may periodically calculate the costs, expenses and fees incurred by the city for each application for which a review deposit is required and send an invoice to the applicant for payment. The applicant shall have ten (10) days from the date of the invoice to pay to the city the invoiced amount. Thereafter, if payment is not received in the required time, the city manager or his/her designee shall apply the review deposit toward payment for the invoiced amounts. If the total of the costs, expenses, and fees incurred by the city for an application for which a review deposit is required exceeds the review deposit, and payment is not received in the required time after invoicing, then the city manager or his/her designee shall apply the review deposit to the unpaid portion of the invoice and send a notice of nonpayment to the applicant for the remaining amount of the invoice. The city manager or designee shall also send a notice to the applicant and to all city staff and city consultants associated with the subject application or project, instructing them to cease all work relating to such application or project unless and until further notified by the city manager or his/her designee. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the applicant. 
Upon receipt of the notice, work by the city staff and city consultants on the application or project shall cease, and neither building permits, certificates of completion, temporary certificates of occupancy, nor certificates of occupancy will be issued with respect to such real property. Continuation of the review of the application or project with respect to the real property for which payment was not made will not be undertaken by the city until such time as all outstanding fees, costs and expenses due under this section are paid in full and a new review deposit paid to the city. 
Unless otherwise provided for in this article, if an applicant receives or is granted approval on an application or project or is issued a building permit, certificate of completion, temporary certificate of occupancy, certificate of occupancy, occupational license or other development order by the city, and additional fees, costs, expenses or such other obligations attributable to the application are thereafter posted to the project account for work that is associated with said approval or issuance, the applicant or his/her successor in interest shall pay said costs, fees and expenses incurred by the city for such application. The city shall send an invoice to the applicant or successor for such fees or expenses, and the applicant or successor shall reimburse the city for such fees or expenses within ten (10) days. 
(b)  Deficiency and liens. Failure to pay an invoiced amount within the requested time shall constitute a violation of this article. Any deficiency owed to the city, whether incurred before or after project approval, shall bear interest from the date of the aforementioned notice of non-payment at the rate of eighteen (18) percent simple interest per annum or otherwise at the highest rate permitted by law until paid. The amount of any such deficiency owed to the city shall, together with interest and the costs of collection as hereinafter provided, shall be the personal obligation of the applicant and shall be a continuing lien on the real property related to the application or project under review. Any subsequent or new owner of the real property related to the application or project shall take title subject to the obligations of the applicant under the terms of this article and shall be jointly and severally liable for such obligations. An applicant may not escape liability for the deficiency by abandonment of the application or project, withdrawal of such application or sale of the real property with respect to which such application has been submitted. If the initial or subsequent invoices are not paid in a timely fashion, and the invoiced amount exceeds the amount of the review deposit, the city may take whatever legal means it deems appropriate to collect the deficiency, including, but not limited to, retaining the services of a collection agency or attorney, initiating legal proceedings for the collection thereof, recording a notice of lien as hereinafter provided, and foreclosing same in the same manner as mortgage liens are foreclosed. 
If the project is subject to the provisions of a development agreement, and the applicant is found to be in default of such development agreement, then it would be considered a default of that agreement and whatever remunerative such development agreement calls for would be applied, as opposed to the provisions called for in this article. 
(Ord. No. 1160, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-146. - Required payments. 
    Payment for costs, expenses and fees incurred by the city under this article is a requirement for the city's final approval of the application and project.

Assessable expenses shall not include the cost of city employee time in reviewing such application, as such time shall be deemed to have been reimbursed by the application fee. 
    City consultants shall submit records of their time, fees, costs, and expenses to the city manager or his/her designee and such fees, costs and expenses shall be invoiced to the applicant on a dollar-for-dollar basis for services provided under the direction of the city to review. The rates charged to the applicant for said services shall not exceed those charged to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-148. - Objections/appeal. 
    Any objection to any invoice or to any matter set forth in this article must be set forth in writing and addressed and delivered to the city manager on or before the tenth day after the date of the relevant invoice. In the event the city manager denies the objection, the applicant shall have ten (10) days after the date of the city manager's written decision to file an appeal of such decision with the city clerk or his/her designee, which appeal shall be heard by the city council. All objections and appeals shall set forth in detail the reasons and evidence upon which the objection and appeal are based. Failure of the applicant to establish beyond a preponderance of the evidence that an invoice is not appropriate and is not based upon competent substantial evidence, shall result in a denial of the objection and appeal. 
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-149. - Attorney's fees in the event of failure to pay review costs. 
    In the event the city is required to enforce this article, then the city shall be entitled to recover from the applicant all costs and expenses incurred, including but not limited to its reasonable attorneys' fees, paralegal fees and other costs and expenses, whether incurred prior to, during or subsequent to court proceedings or on appeal, and/or in any bankruptcy proceedings involving the applicant, the real property and/or the project being reviewed. 
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-150. - Change of ownership. 
    An applicant shall provide prompt written notice to the city manager in the event of a change in ownership of all or a portion of a lot, tract, or parcel of real property with respect to which an application, or project is pending before the city. Such notice shall be on a form approved by the city and shall include the name, address and phone number of the new owner and a legal description of the lot, tract or parcel of real property now owned by the new owner. Any such new owner (i) shall not be entitled to utilize or draw upon any review deposit previously paid to the city by the original applicant, (ii) shall be liable to the city for all fees, costs and expenses related to the lot, tract or parcel of real property which arise subsequent to the date the new owner acquires title to such real property, and (iii) may be required by the city to pay a separate review deposit in the same manner as a new application, in which case a separate project account will be opened in the name of the new owner or the new owner's authorized agent. If a separate review deposit is required, no work shall be undertaken by the city or its consultants with respect to the lot, tract or parcel of real property under control of the new owner until a separate review deposit is paid to the city. Until such time as the city receives such written notice of a change in ownership, the original applicant shall be jointly and severally liable to the city for all fees, costs and expenses associated with the application or project; provided, however, that upon receipt by the city of a notification of change of ownership, the original applicant shall no longer be liable to the city for fees, costs and expenses incurred by the city which arise after receipt of the notification of change of ownership, and the new owner shall be solely liable to the city for all such fees, costs and expenses associated with the application or project activities subsequent to the date of receipt by the city of such notification. Additionally, the applicant shall be entitled to a refund of any review deposit balance as of the date said change of ownership notice is received by the city, provided all assessable costs, expenses and fees hereunder and incurred to that date are paid in full. 
(Ord. No. 1169, § 1, 1-14-08) 
Sec. 7.5-151. - Agreement to be bound by this article.

The requirements maintain and improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment, including:(1) improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral intake; (2) maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge; (3) reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation; (4) promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade, reducing heat gain in and on building or paved areas; (5) reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process of evapotranspiration; (6) reducing erosion caused by construction, neglect or overuse of land by binding soil particles and holding the soil together against the effects of wind and water; and (7) encouraging the conservation of limited fresh water resources through the use of site-specific plants and various planting and maintenance techniques. 
(2)  Water conservation. The requirements promote conservation of potable and nonpotable water by encouraging the preservation of existing plant communities, encouraging the planting of natural or uncultivated areas, encouraging the use of site-specific plant materials and controlled irrigation systems. 
(3)  Preservation of existing vegetation. The requirements preserve existing natural vegetation and incorporate native plants, plant communities and ecosystems into landscape. 
(4)  Removal of nuisance species. The requirements eradicate or control certain exotic plant species which have become nuisances because of their tendency to damage public and private works, to have a negative effect upon public health, or to disrupt or destroy native ecosystems. 
(5)  Human values. The requirements provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspect of urban development. 
(6)  Aesthetics. The requirements improve the aesthetic appearance of commercial and residential areas through the incorporation of cultivated open space into development in ways that harmonize and enhance the natural and built environment. 
(7)  Improved administration and enforcement. The requirements establish procedures and standards for the administration and enforcement of this chapter, integrated and consistent with other provisions of the City Code.

(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-5. - Protected and prohibited landscape species. 
(a)  Protected species. All plant species considered endangered or threatened as defined by this chapter, and amended on occasion, shall be hereinafter referred to as the protected plant list and shall not be removed from any site without approvals from all federal and state agencies. 
(1)  Endangered species. Endangered plants means species of plants native to the State of Florida that are in imminent danger of extinction within the state, the survival of which is unlikely if the causes of a decline in the number of plants continue, and includes all species determined to be endangered pursuant to the rules of the State of Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, Chapter 5B-40, F.A.C., as amended. 
(2)  Threatened species. Threatened plants means species native to the State of Florida that are in rapid decline in number of plants within the state, but which have not decreased in such number as to cause them to be endangered and includes all species determined to be threatened pursuant to the State of Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, Chapter 5B-40, F.A.C., as amended. 
(b)  Prohibited species. Specific plants are unacceptable for use due to a number of factors. Some plants may eventually cause safety or maintenance problems. Other plants are locally objectionable or serve as hosts to disease or insects affecting other plants and may be ruled unacceptable as deemed necessary. Spine-bearing or poisonous plants can be used only in areas inaccessible to pedestrians. Fruit-bearing or other plants which might become an "attractive nuisance" or dangerous to pedestrians should be avoided unless planted in inaccessible areas. The following plant list shall hereinafter be referred to as to the Prohibited Plant List, and the removal of such plants shall be exempt from the permitting process of this code.

(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-6. - Vegetation removal permits, right-of-way maintenance permits, and landscape plans. 
(a)  Vegetation removal permit. 
(1)  Applicability. Unless otherwise provided in this section, no person, corporation, association, public agency, or agent or employee thereof, shall effectively destroy or remove vegetation from any property within the city without first obtaining a vegetation removal permit from the building official. Vegetation removal permits, whether or not sought in conjunction with building permits, shall be obtained by making application on a form prescribed by the city, prior to the removal, relocation or replacement of vegetation from or on the following types of property: 
a.  All vacant or undeveloped sites, or; 
b.  All land currently zoned for agricultural and proposed for bona fide agricultural purposes as defined in this Chapter, or; 
c.  All rights-of-way, public or private. The City of Maitland is exempt from this provision. 
d.  All non-residential and non-duplex developed sites or; 
e.  Any clearing of vegetation from the littoral zone or shoreline protection area. 
In the event that any vegetation shall endanger health, safety or property, and require immediate removal without delay, verbal authorization may be given by the city and the vegetation removed without obtaining a written permit as herein required. Such verbal authorization shall later be confirmed in writing by the city. Applicants for permits shall be entitled to and may be required to demonstrate by means of a landscape plan that an improvement or betterment of the environment can be accomplished over the existing site conditions, if landscaping and tree planting improvements are installed in accordance with the landscape plan and existing trees and vegetation are removed. If such a landscape plan is approved by the city, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued to the site until the work is completed as specified on the approved landscape plan. In the event the proposed landscaping improvements are not being done in conjunction with a proposed structure requiring a certificate of occupancy, the applicant shall guarantee by adequate bond or other means acceptable by the city the faithful adherence and completion of such landscape plan. All work performed shall be consistent with the approved vegetation removal permit and landscape plan. 
(2)  Issuance and conditions of permit. Once the information provided in the application for vegetation removal permit is deemed adequate as to form and content by the city, admission to grant or deny the vegetation removal permit with or without conditions shall be made by the city. The city shall render its decision only after the approval of the applicable site plan review or other development only after the approval of the applicable site plan review or other development approval process, building permit and/or landscape plan. Vegetation removal permits under this section shall be issued where a tree, due to natural circumstances, is no longer viable, is in danger of falling, is too close to existing structures so as to endanger such structures, interferes with utility services, creates unsafe vision clearance or constitutes a health hazard; where the affected vegetation will be relocated, replaced with a suitable substitute tree or otherwise preserved; and where in consideration of the factors set out in this Code, the city determines that the issuance of the permit is justified. 
As a condition to the granting of a vegetation removal permit under this section, the applicant shall be required to relocate vegetation which would otherwise be destroyed to another location upon the site, or to replace vegetation which will be destroyed with suitable replacements elsewhere within this site. A relocation plan, if applicable, shall be approved as part of the landscape plan and the manner of relocation shall be as approved by the city. In determining the required relocation, replacement or root-pruning of vegetation, the city shall consider the needs of the intended use of the property, including all lands dedicated to public use together with an evaluation of the following: 
a.  Existing vegetative coverage on the site and in the immediate surrounding area. 
b.  Quantity, type, size (DBH) and condition of vegetation to be removed on the entire site. 
c.  The feasibility of relocating the particular vegetation. 
d.  Topography and drainage of the site. 
e.  The type, size and condition of the replacement vegetation. 
f.  The nature of the existing and intended use of the property. 
Upon approval of an application made under this section and the payment of the required fee, the city shall issue a permit therefore. With each such permit the city shall issue a permit card which shall bear all pertinent information thereon. Such card shall be maintained in a conspicuous place on the front of the premises affected thereby and shall be covered with plastic or glass during the entire time that the work authorized by the vegetation permit is in progress. 
(3)  Time limits. A vegetation removal permit issued under this section shall expire and become null and void if work authorized by such permit is not commenced within forty-five (45) days from date of the permit or if such work when commenced is suspended or abandoned at any time for a period of fourteen (14) days. If work has commenced and the permit becomes null and void or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed tree removal activity shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. In addition, the applicant must notify the city building official at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the removal or relocation work before work may begin. This provision shall not be applicable when said work is halted due to legal action by the city against the permittee. A final inspection is required upon completion of all work and shall be requested within forty-eight (48) hours of completion. 
(b)  Right-of-way maintenance permit required for work affecting trees, shrubs in public places; supervision. Unless performed by the city, no tree planting, removal, surgery, cavity-filing, trimming or spraying shall be done on any tree or shrub within any public right-of-way or on any property owned by the city without first obtaining a permit for such work from the building official. No tree or shrub shall be trimmed by or under the direction of any public utility company for any purpose without possession of such a permit from the city. Such tree and shrub work shall be done under the supervision of the city. 
(c)  Landscape plan. 
1.  Applicability. A landscape plan is required for any vegetation removal permit which includes property in excess of an acre in size and the property is zoned for other than single-family residential or duplex uses. Likewise, the building official may require a landscape plan for permits which incorporate a combination of trees and shrubs for areas in excess of ten thousand (10,000) square feet and the landscape plan would clarify the intent of the applicant. Furthermore, an applicant may choose to submit a landscape plan to clarify the request for vegetation removal, maintenance or improvement. Finally, a landscape plan is required for any new construction or structural expansion. Single-family residential or duplex uses are exempt from this provision, except for the subdivision of land. 
2.  Required contents. The landscape plan shall be drawn at a noted scale of at least 1?=30'. The landscape plan shall clearly identify the following: 
a.  Type, caliper and character of existing trees greater than 6? DBH. 
b.  Proposed landscape areas, including berms and buffers (reference species type, dimensions and character at planting, as well as spot elevations and contours for berms); 
c.  Location, height and material for walkways, fences, walls and other manmade landscape features; 
d.  Existing vegetation to be preserved (reference species type, dimensions and character); 
e.  Relocation and/or preservation management process, if applicable; 
f.  Irrigation plan; and 
g.  North arrow. 
The city may require additional information as is necessary to evaluate the application. 
(3)  Preparation and signature, exemptions. The landscape plan must be prepared by and signed and sealed by a landscape architect registered in the State of Florida. Properties less than one (1) acre in size where proposed expansion is less than twenty-five (25) per cent of the existing structural square footage of where total landscape improvements are estimated to cost less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) (including installation) are exempt from this provision. Likewise, properties less than one-half acre in size are exempt from this provision. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95; Ord. No. 1196, § 2, 4-12-10) 
Sec. 8-7. - Tree and vegetation preservation during development and construction. 
(a)  Erosion control measures. Site work for new construction, rehabilitation and maintenance generally include clearing of ground cover and other vegetation. Once soil is exposed, it is susceptible to erosion and sediment transport. If left unchecked, siltation can develop in culverts, swales, ditches and other drainage facilities and eventually impede or completely block flow. Another problem associated with siltation is degradation of water supply and loss of top soil. 
    The best way to avoid erosion and siltation problems is to prevent them from occurring. This requires forethought prior to construction. Erosion and sediment control planning shall be incorporated in any project site plans. Control of project construction water, selective clearing, and timely stabilization of newly finished work should also be included. 
(b)  Vegetation protection measures. During construction, all reasonable steps necessary to prevent the destruction or damaging of vegetation shall be taken. Vegetation destroyed or receiving major damage must be replaced by vegetation of equal environmental value, as specified by the city, before occupancy or use unless approval for their removal has been granted under permit. 
(1)  Installation of barriers. All protection barriers shall be installed and maintained for the period of time beginning with the commencement of any land clearing or building operations and ending with the completion of the permitted development. 
(2)  On-site representative required. The applicant for a vegetative removal permit shall, at the time of application, designate an on-site representative who will be responsible for the installation and the maintenance of all tree protection barriers. The representative shall be responsible for supervising the removal of all existing vegetation permitted to be removed. The representative shall be on-site at all times during the vegetation clearing operations. 
(3)  Protection of existing trees. 
a.  Barrier required. When the retention of single trees or groups of trees are required by this chapter, a protective barrier, similar to that required in "4" above, shall be placed around the tree(s) and signed to prohibit storage and harmful activity, with the means of protection subject to city approval. A preservation detail and description of the method to be used shall be submitted with the vegetation removal permit, if applicable, or building permit. 
b.  Filling and construction debris. During construction, unless otherwise authorized by the vegetation removal permit, preservation detail or landscape plan, no excess soil, additional fill, vehicles, equipment, liquids, or construction debris, shall be placed within the dripline of any vegetation that is required to be preserved in its present location. 
c.  Excavation. Unless otherwise authorized by the vegetation removal permit, no soil is to be removed or added within the dripline of any tree that is to remain at its original location. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-7.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of sections 8-7.1 through 8-7.11 is to protect and enhance the tree canopy within the City of Maitland. The city will encourage the protection of healthy trees, promote the removal of prohibited tree species and the replacement of removed trees as necessary to achieve the minimum thirty-percent canopy coverage established as a goal in the comprehensive development plan. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95; Ord. No. 995, § 75, 3-27-00; Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 8-10-09) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1190, § 2, adopted Aug. 10, 2009, added provisions numbered as §§ 8-8-8-18. In order to avoid the renumbering of provisions of this chapter, the editor has redesignated these added provisions as §§ 8-7.1-8-7.11. 
Sec. 8-7.2. - Residential tree removal permit; applicability; standards. 
(a)  Tree removal permit. Except as provided in section 8-13, no person shall cut down, destroy, remove, top or relocate any tree without first obtaining a tree removal permit from the city. Work authorized by the permit shall be accomplished within ninety (90) days of issuance of the permit. 
(b)  Standards. All properties shall maintain a sufficient number of trees to achieve the purpose and intent of this Code. Residential lots shall conform to the following standards for either the minimum number of trees or the minimum total diameter (as DBH) of trees: 
Lot size Minimum 
Number of Trees Minimum Diameter (DBH)(inches) 0-8,000 s.f. 2 7 8,001-16,000 s.f. 4 14 16,001-24,000 s.f. 7 22 24,001-36,000 s.f. 10 31 36,001-43,560 s.f. 12 37 43,560+ s.f. (37? DBH per acre)

(c)  Applications shall be accompanied by: 
(1)  Permit application fee shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) (for a dead tree, the permit fee shall be zero dollars ($0.00), but a permit shall still be required for removal); 
(2)  An accurate site plan, drawn to scale, indicating which tree(s) are proposed to be removed, depicting the species or common names and sizes of all trees; 
(3)  A plan stating the means of offsetting each removed tree with a replacement tree, including the species, common name, locations and DBH size of any replacement tree(s); and 
(4)  Identification of the company or individual person(s) who will undertake the tree removal and replacement. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
Sec. 8-7.5. - Criteria for issuance of tree removal permit. 
(a)  The city manager or his/her designee shall review and evaluate all complete tree removal permits and respond based on the following criteria: 
(1)  If the requested action does not cause the lot to fall below the standards as noted in section 8-7.5(b), the permit shall be approved. 
(2)  A tree removal permit shall be approved for any tree that is dead or beyond recovery; provided, however, that if removal causes the lot to fall below the standards noted in section 8-7.5(b), replacement of the tree in question may be required as noted in section 8-7.7(b). 
(b)  Tree removal that results in lowering the tree count below the required standards as described in section 8-9(b) may be replaced or compensated for pursuant to section 8-7-7. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
Sec. 8-7.6. - Exceptions. 
(a)  In the event a tree poses an imminent danger to the health, safety, or property and requires immediate removal, the city manager or his/her designee may provide written authorization for the tree to be removed without requiring a tree removal permit as otherwise required by this article. 
(b)  Tree removal permits shall not be required for trees listed in section 8-5(b), as such section may be updated from time to time. 
(c)  During city-declared emergencies, the city manager or his/her designee may waive the residential tree removal permitting requirements for trees that pose an imminent threat to health, safety, or property so as not to hamper public and/or private work to restore order. 
(d)  Trees that may achieve a height greater than fourteen (14) feet in an established electric utility right-of-way or that intrude from the side of the electric utility right-of-way closer than the clearance distance specified in Table 2 of ANSI Z133.1-2000 for lines affected by the North American Electric Reliability Council Standard, FAC 003.1 requirement R1.2 that are removed by the City of Maitland or a public utility shall not require a tree removal permit, subject to forty-eight (48) hours' advance notification to the city. 
(e)  Tree pruning or trimming conducted by an electric utility in conformance with ANSI A300 (Part I)-2001 pruning standards and ANSI Z133.1-2000 Pruning, Repairing, Maintaining, and Removing Trees, and Cutting Brush - Safety Requirements, shall not require a tree removal permit, subject to forty-eight (48) hours' advance notification to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
Sec. 8-7.7. - Tree relocation and replacement. 
    In the event a proposed tree removal would result in a lot falling below the minimum standards as provided in section 8-7.2(b), a permit shall be issued, conditioned upon acceptable relocation or replacement of trees. The applicant shall have the choice of relocation or replacement. Relocation of trees is preferred over removal and replacement with new trees. 
(a)  Relocation. Relocation may be accomplished by replanting a tree to another location within the lot. If relocation is approved, the tree removal permit shall not require any additional trees to be planted, regardless of the size of the tree that is relocated. However, if the relocated tree dies within one (1) year of being relocated, the permittee shall purchase a replacement tree and plant it. 
(b)  Replacement. Replacement of a removed tree may be accomplished by planting a number of trees according to the minimum standards referenced in section 8-7.2(b) on the same lot or on nearby public property or private property with the applicable property owner's written permission. Upon planting, a replacement tree becomes a "tree" by definition and shall thereafter require a permit for removal. 
(c)  Payment in lieu of relocation or replanting. At the option of the applicant, payment of a tree replacement fee to the City of Maitland tree replacement account may be made in lieu of relocation or planting where relocating or planting trees is not the preferred alternative. Such payment shall be made in the amount necessary to cover the cost of the replacement trees that would otherwise have been required. The cost of replacement trees shall be determined by the city manager or his/her designee, based on the formula used by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers for tree replacement. 
(d)  Standards. The following standards shall apply to replacement trees: 
(1)  If the natural growth habit of a replacement tree is destroyed within a year of planting, the permittee shall replace the tree. 
(2)  If a replacement tree is planted within four (4) feet of a public sidewalk or other paved area, then root barriers shall be installed pursuant to normal practice. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
Sec. 8-7.8. - Specimen trees. 
    For specimen trees, the following replacement rate shall apply. 
Specimen Tree Size Requirement No. of Replacement Trees -OR - Required DBH for Replacement (inches) 30-35? DBH 3 -OR- 9 35+-45 DBH 4 -OR- 12 45+ inches 5 -OR- 15  
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
Sec. 8-7.9. - Penalties. 
(a)  The city manager or his/her designee shall investigate potential violations and report them to the special magistrate pursuant to the code enforcement procedures found in Chapter 5.3 of the Maitland City Code. 
(b)  If the special magistrate finds that a violation of this article has occurred, the following guidelines shall be used for the application of penalties. 
(1)  Remedial action shall be taken to restore the property consistent with a restoration plan approved by the city manager or his/her designee. The restoration plan shall include payment of required application fee and may require tree replacement and required mitigation of any other damage to the property. Remedial action must be taken within sixty (60) days or as approved by the special magistrate. 
(2)  Removal of trees without a permit, except as covered in section 8-7.6, or subjecting trees to tree abuse, shall be considered to be in violation of this section and may be mitigated by one or a combination of the following: 
a.  Replacement equal to the cumulative DBH of trees removed to the cumulative DBH of trees to be installed. 
b.  Replacement trees shall be approved by the city manager or his/her designee as sustainable in the location where the tree(s) are to be planted. 
c.  Payment into the city tree fund equal to twice the cost of replacement on an inch-to-inch basis. If the precise DBH cannot be determined, the cost of replacement shall be determined by the city manager or his/her designee based on the best estimate of DBH of the removed or damaged tree. 
d.  Replacement trees shall have a one-year guarantee. 
e.  If the natural growth habit of the tree is destroyed, the violator shall remove the abused tree and install a replacement tree. 
f.  Such other remedy as the special magistrate may deem appropriate.

(a)  Where a property owner believes that a unique lot configuration, geographic feature, or other constraint exists, the property owner may request an administrative determination from the city manager or his/her designee, granting relief from strict adherence to this Code. 
(1)  Where a property owner feels that his/her lot falls under the above criteria, he/she shall prepare a written explanation of the constraints that exist on the lot, as well as a tree planting and/or relocation plan, clarifying how the unique features of the lot in question preclude complete conformance to this tree preservation code and explaining how the property owner will conform as closely as possible to the requirements of this Code. 
(2)  The city manager or his/her designee shall review the written explanation and plan and meet with the property owner, as necessary, to obtain additional understanding of the situation. 
(3)  Following the review, the city manager or his/her designee shall issue a written administrative determination, either approving the relief sought by the property owner, approving a compromise plan that has been worked out between the city manager or his/her designee and the property owner, or denying the requested relief. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative determination allowing relief from strict application of this Code shall provide the property owner with the necessary authority to act in accordance with the approved plan. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09)

The appeal will then be scheduled for the next available meeting of the board of zoning adjustment. The board of zoning adjustment shall consider the appeal and shall render a decision to either uphold or overturn the interpretation of the public works director. The decision of the board of zoning adjustment shall be final within the ambit of the authority of the City of Maitland. 
(Ord. No. 1190, § 2, 4-10-09) 
ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 8-8. - Plant materials. 
(a)  Specific intent. The use of plant material enhances environmental quality by improving air quality, reducing heat gain on surface areas, and reducing erosion. Likewise, it promotes human values and the appearance of the city. Therefore, the use of synthetic lawns, outdoor carpeting, Astroturf, etc. shall not meet any requirements of open space or landscaped areas for this chapter, nor shall the use of synthetic plants meet any of the requirements of this chapter. Furthermore, no synthetic plants can be used to meet the requirements for buffering or screening. The use of native and drought tolerant species is strongly encouraged. After initial watering period, reduced irrigation time schedule will result in lower water consumption and cost savings. 
(b)  Plant categories. 
(1)  Shade/canopy tree. Shade/canopy trees shall be a minimum overall height of twelve (12) feet, with a minimum of five (5) feet of clear trunk immediately after installation. A shade or canopy tree shall reach a minimum height of thirty-five (35) feet and a minimum canopy spread of twenty-five (25) feet at maturity. This category shall constitute forty (40) percent minimum of the total trees required on the site. 
(2)  Intermediate tree. Intermediate trees shall be a minimum overall height of ten (10) feet and a minimum of four (4) feet of clear trunk immediately after installation. An intermediate tree shall reach a minimum height of twenty (20) feet and minimum canopy spread of fifteen (15) feet at maturity. This category shall constitute thirty (30) percent minimum of the total trees required. 
(3)  Small tree. Small trees shall be a minimum overall height of eight (8) feet immediately after installation. This category shall constitute no more than twenty (20) percent of the total trees required. 
(4)  Palms. Palms shall have a minimum of six (6) feet of clear wood and shall constitute no more than thirty (30) percent of the total trees required. Palms must have a minimum twelve (12) feet height. A grouping of three (3) palm trees will be the equivalent of one (1) required canopy tree. No more than forty (40) percent of the shade/canopy tree requirements can be replaced with palms. 
(5)  Existing tree credit. It is the intent of this chapter to ensure the successful retention of existing native species. Therefore, trees required to be planted or preserved by this chapter may be used to satisfy the following requirements of this or other codes: 
a.  Interior of vehicular use areas. 
b.  Perimeter of vehicular use areas. 
c.  Perimeter buffers. 
d.  Trees required to be planted or preserved by this section shall not be used outside the property lines of the subject site, unless specifically permitted in this chapter. 
No credit will be allowed for any tree proposed to be retained if there is any encroachment within the area required by the city to be protected or if the tree is unhealthy or dead, as determined by the city. An encroachment is defined as any change in the natural grade, construction of any impervious surfaces, trenching or excavation, storage of equipment, materials or earth and the temporary or permanent parking or circulation of vehicles or equipment. Any tree maintained for credit in compliance with this article shall be given credit against the landscape area requirements of this chapter to the following schedule: 
Large Tree ..... 6?+DBH ..... 400 square feet Intermediate Tree ..... 3?+DBH ..... 200 square feet Small Tree ..... 11/2?DBH ..... 100 square feet  
Preservation of groups of trees is also encouraged, with both the tree size and land area preserved for credit in compliance with this article to be given credit against the land area requirements of this chapter. 
(6)  Shrubs. 
a.  Planting standards. When required to be planted by this chapter or other city regulation, shrubs or hedges shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches in height and have a spread of eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches immediately upon planting, and typically spaced thirty (30) inches on center. Spacing of individual plants shall depend upon the type of hedge material used and is subject to the approval of the city. Hedges shall be of evergreen species and shall form a solid continuous visual screen of at least three (3) feet in height within one (1) year after the time of planting. When shrubs are used as a visual buffer around vehicular use areas, they shall be maintained as a solid continuous visual screen of at least four (4) feet in height within two (2) years after the time of planting and thereafter. As an exception to this provision, where the shrubs are planted in the required front yard of a residential zoning district or in a visibility triangle as defined in the city regulations, or when planted in the interior parking lot planter islands, shrubs shall not exceed a height of thirty (30) inches. 
b.  Exceptions and substitutions from this regulation may be reviewed and approved by the city in order to promote the use of slow growing or native plant materials or to promote safety. 
c.  When shrubs are used as a visual buffer around vehicular use areas, the height of shrubs at installation shall be measured from the vehicular use area pavement surface. No hedge shall constitute any obstruction to visibility. 
(7)  Vines. Vines shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches in supported height immediately after planting, and may be used in conjunction with fences, visual screens or walls to meet landscape buffer requirements as specified, as long as the structure is maintained consistent with city regulations. 
(8)  Ground covers. Ground covers shall be planted with a minimum of fifty (50) percent coverage with one-hundred (100) percent coverage occurring within two (2) years. 
(9)  Lawn grass. Grass areas must be sodded, plugged, sprigged or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. Grass sod shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Sod pieces shall be neatly mowed. Damage or breakage shall not occur when pieces are picked up by one end. Grass seed shall be delivered to the job site in sealed bags with Florida Department of Agriculture tags attached. Seed, where used, shall be of a variety that will produce complete coverage within ninety (90) days from sowing. Where other than solid sod or grass seed is used, nurse grass seed shall be sown for immediate effect and protection until coverage is otherwise achieved. 
(c)  Standards for landscape materials. 
(1)  Minimum quality standards. All plant materials shall be a minimum of Florida Number One as defined in Grades and Standards Revised, Part II, as published by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Exceptions and substitutions from this regulation may be reviewed and approved by the city in order to promote the use of slow growing or native plant materials. The plant species identified in the St. Johns River Water Management District's Xeriscape Plant Guide, pages 18 through 28, inclusive, and as amended from time to time, may be used to meet the requirements of this code. 
(2)  Minimum planting standards. All plant installation shall meet the requirements established in the American Standard for Nursery Stock as published by the American Nursery and Landscape Association Manual, 1996 edition. 
(3)  Requirements for diversity. When more than five (5) trees per category are required to be planted to meet the requirements of this Code, mix of species shall be provided. The number of species to be planted shall vary according to the overall number of trees required to be planted. The minimum number of species to be planted are indicated in the table below: 
Required Trees Minimum Species 5-10 2 11-35 3 36-50 4  
One (1) additional tree species for each additional fifty (50) trees. 
(4)  Mulches. The use of organic mulches reduces the growth of weeds and adds nutrients to the soil, and retains moisture over the root zones of plant materials. A minimum of two (2) inches of organic mulch should be placed over all newly installed tree, shrub and ground cover planting areas. This requirement excludes annuals and plants that are susceptible to fungus. A weed mat may be used to decrease the mulch depth, as approved by the city. Measurement for mulch depth shall be for settled mulch condition. 
(d)  Appropriate placement. Plants used in the landscape design shall meet specific cultural requirements for healthy plant growth, for instance: 
(1)  Plant materials installed, in locations where the predominate soil type is well draining sands, such as on a berm, should be able to tolerate reduced water conditions; 
(2)  Plant materials installed around retention/detention ponds or in swales should be able to tolerate wet conditions caused by poorly drained soils; and 
(3)  Plant materials installed in locations where the predominate soil types is marly, mucky, has a hardpan layer or is one of many other poorly drained soils, shall be able to tolerate wet conditions. 
(4)  Plant materials shall be compatible with the expected level and intensity of sun, wind, and temperature exposure.

ARTICLE V. - SPECIFIC LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 8-9. - Maintaining safe sight distances for street trees and landscaping in rights-of-way. 
    On a corner lot, nothing shall be planted, placed or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision, which constitutes hazardous conditions for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, between a height of two and one-half (21/2) and ten (10) feet above the top of the curb of the intersection streets in the areas bounded by the street right-of-way lines and line joining points along said street right-of-way lines twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection on minor (local, local collector) and collector streets, and fifty (50) feet on arterial streets. Likewise, for all properties other than single-family residential or duplexes, the area of restricted planting and maintenance shall be bounded by the street right-of-way and driveway ingress and/or egress edge of pavement lines (or a line perpendicular to the street right-of-way at its intersection with the edge of the driveway access) and a line joining points along said street right-of-way line and driveway access edge fifteen (15) feet from the point of intersection. For these areas, no plant material other than tree trunks shall be located between two and one-half (21/2) and ten (10) feet in height as measured from the top of the curb, if applicable, or edge of pavement nearest intersection area. Landscaping, except required turf and ground cover, shall be maintained with a twelve-inch clearance from the edge of any sidewalk or access way pavement, and all vegetation shall be maintained to provide a minimum clearance of eight (8) feet over sidewalk and fourteen (14) feet over streets. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-10. - Minimum requirements for street trees and landscaping within the rights-of-way. 
    When a developer is required by this chapter to incorporate trees into areas designated as the medians or rights-of-way, special permits are required. Permit application forms shall be prepared and made available to applicants by the building official. The city shall have the final authority to approve or disapprove of the location of plants and landscaping with respect to safe and proper engineering practices. The permittee, or his successor in interest, shall be responsible for the standard horticultural practices of all landscaping and shall keep the area free of debris. Those species whose roots are known to cause damage to pavement or utilities shall not be planted closer than four (4) feet to a public street or utility structure unless an approved root barrier structure is installed. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-11. - Minimum requirements for developments. 
    Multifamily residential, office and commercial guidelines: 
(1)  Trees, turf, ground cover, shrubs and landscape materials (e.g., mulches, stone, etc.) shall be installed to cover all ground not covered by building and paving or preserved ecological communities. 
(2)  A minimum of one (1) tree and ten (10) shrubs shall be planted or preserved for every two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of site area, excluding only areas of vegetation required to be preserved by law. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-12. - Street tree landscape regulation. 
    Single-family residential and duplex uses shall provide a street landscape area along any existing or proposed public street rights-of-way adjacent to or adjoining the property except for those portions of the lot used for driveways. 
(1)  All zoning districts, including single-family residential and duplex zoning districts. The required minimum street landscape area shall be five feet (5) wide as measured perpendicular to the recorded public street right-of-way. If right-of-way width is adequate, trees may be planted in the right-of-way subject to applicable City regulations. One (1) shade/canopy tree per fifty (50) linear feet of road frontage is required. 
(2)  Expansions and changes. Any additions, renovations or expansions to a property which improvement is valued at two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) or higher shall meet the requirements of this section before a certificate of occupancy may be issued. 
Sec. 8-13. - Buffer yard landscape regulations. 
    Buffer yards shall be provided and maintained when certain land uses are adjacent to or directly across from each other in order to protect these land uses from the traffic, noise, glare, trash, activity, vibration, odor, visual disorder, and other harmful or noxious effects likely to be emitted by or associated with a more intense land use. Buffer yard regulations are also required to prevent adverse community appearance, to protect the character of the area and to conserve the values of buildings and land. Buffer yards of different depths and minimum planting densities are required depending upon the proposed and adjoining uses and the adverse effects which the proposed land uses have on the adjoining land uses. Suitable species and varied heights of plants shall be used to effectively break up and absorb sound. 
(1)  Applicability. Buffer yard requirements are to be applied to any new use of land or change in type of occupancy. They also apply to expansions or additions of the floor area and/or land surface area. Overlapping of buffer yards with each other or with vehicular surface area landscape regulations is not intended to be cumulative but the most intensive requirements shall apply for these instances. This section shall also apply to uses separated by right-of-way where the right-of-way is less than sixty (60) feet in width. In this instance the adjoining use shall be the use across from the right-of-way. Where right-of-way is sixty (60) feet or more in width, the right-of-way shall be deemed the adjoining use. 
(b)  Required buffer yards. 
(1)  Adjacent vacant residential. One hundred (100) per cent of the required buffer yard is necessary if the developing property is adjacent to a residential zoning district. 
(2)  Adjacent vacant nonresidential. If the developing lot is adjoining a lot that is vacant and not zoned for residential uses, then a minimum of fifty (50) per cent of the buffer yard requirements for depth is required. 
(3)  Buffer yard depth and intensity requirements. Chart A:Minimum Depth and Intensity Categories for City of Maitland Buffer Yards, and Chart B:Buffer Yard Requirements, City of Maitland, are hereby adopted as the minimum buffer yard categories and requirements for the city. To determine the required yard category for a site, Chart A assigns the proposed land use category on the top horizontal row, from which the adjoining use category may be determined on the vertical row. The point of intersection determines the appropriate buffer category (A,B,C,D, or NONE) for that property boundary. The buffer yard category shall be determined for each property border using this method. 
Chart B determines the minimum depth and planting intensities (minimum number of trees and shrubs required for each one hundred (100) linear feet of property boundary or portion thereof) for each category. The left hand row indicates the depth of the required yard. Each category has a minimum required depth, with a potential increase to fifty (50) feet. The columns are assigned the minimum number of shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet of property line and a minimum number of trees per one hundred (100) linear feet. A line is assigned to each category, which line represents the minimum depth and intensity requirements for each category. The dashed part of each line represents the minimum depth for each category and the solid portion of the line represents the built-in relationship whereas a greater depth for the buffer permits less shrubs and a greater number of trees to be planted. The maximum buffer depth permitted is fifty (50) feet. 
(4)  Buffer yard selection and application. An applicant shall clearly delineate the buffer yards selected on the landscape plan. The buffer depth may vary along property lines as long as the total square footage of the selected buffer yard meets or exceeds the required yard area required for the total site and depth is not reduced below the minimum where impacts are deemed to require a visual screen. The buffer depth selection shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(c)  Plant materials. 
(1)  Trees shall be spaced a maximum of thirty (30) feet on center and a minimum of ten (10) feet on center. 
(2)  All required shrub plantings for the buffer yards shall form a solid continuous visual screen of at least six (6) feet in height within one (1) year after planting, except for plantings within the visibility triangles defined in section 8-8 or within the required front yards of residential zoning districts, consistent with Chapter 21 of the Maitland City Code, in which the height shall be maintained at thirty (30) inches within one (1) year of planting. 
(d)  Existing vegetation. Existing vegetation which meets or exceeds the quantity, spacing, and height standards, may be used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter, provided that there are no encroachments as defined in this chapter. Supplemental native shrubs may be required, however, if it can be reasonably inferred that after two (2) years, the existing vegetation will not continually provide a year-round foliage screen between properties from the natural grade to six (6) feet above grade, as required in this section.

Letters (A,B,C,D) reference protective yard category (see Chart A). 
(*) Two required shrubs may be deleted in exchange for every one (1) tree above the minimum tree requirements in a buffer yard of forty (40) feet or less. 
(e)  Walls and berms. A wall, berm, or other landscape barrier may be located within the perimeter landscape strip to meet the minimum six-foot height requirement. However, no six-foot hedge, wall, berm or combination thereof may be placed or maintained within the front yard of a residential zoning district according to zoning code requirements or within a sight distance triangle. 
(1)  Wall. A solid masonry wall may be used to meet the requirements of this Chapter, where the buffer area required exceeds twenty (20) per cent of the lot area. Solid masonry walls shall be compatible, in terms of texture and quality, with the material and color of the principal building. Trees shall be planted between the wall and adjoining property line at the same minimum ratio as No. 3 below. If a solid wall is erected, the depth of the buffer yard may be reduced by one-half. At no time, however, shall the buffer yard be reduced by more than one-half. 
(2)  Berms. Berms may be used only when installed in conjunction with sufficient plant materials to satisfy the provisions of the Chapter. Any berms installed in a buffer yard shall have a minimum height of two (2) feet and a minimum crown width of two (2) feet and a stabilized side slope shall not exceed a ratio of 4:1. If a berm is installed, the width of the transitional protective yard may be reduced by twenty-five (25) per cent. To optimize the height of the earthen berms, the use of right-of-way is permissible with city approval. Berms shall be landscaped such that no less than thirty (30) per cent of the raised area planted is a combination of trees, shrubs, hedging and/or ground covers, the remainder to be sodded. The berms shall be constructed in a curvilinear manner to present a natural attractive appearance from the street. 
(3)  Berms and walls in combination. A wall may be located between the berm and the higher intensity use (intensity is measured from right to left and top to bottom on Chart A, with single-family uses the least intensive and Commercial/Offices 100,000+ gsf the most intensive). At least twenty (20) per cent of the total plants required shall be located between the wall and the higher intensity use and at least fifty (50) per cent shall be planted between the fence or wall and adjoining property. No credit is allowed for elimination of required trees by installing a wall. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-14. - Shoreline alteration and landscaping. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The regulations established in this section are intended to implement policies adopted in the Conservation Element of the City of Maitland's Comprehensive Development Plan. It is the intent of the City of Maitland to promote the health, safety, and welfare of existing and future residents, property owners, and visitors to the city by establishing minimum standards for the protection of natural plant communities along wetlands and shorelines, and the installation and continued maintenance of wetland and waterfront vegetative areas within Maitland. 
    The regulations in this chapter are created in order to achieve the following: 
(1)  Improve environmental quality. The regulations are designed to improve environmental quality by protecting vegetation in riparian and littoral zones. Such vegetation greatly benefits the environment by: (1) slowing and filtering rainfall runoff, thereby trapping and settling out sediments and pollutants and hence improving water quality; (2) maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge; (3) reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, chemical and nutrient pollution; through the biological capacities of trees and other vegetation; (4) providing habitat and cover and hence promoting wildlife conservation; (5) binding soil particles and holding soils together against the effects of wind, waves, and water and hence reducing erosion caused by construction, neglect, trampling, or overuse of shorelines: and (6) providing food to micro-organisms, benthic organisms, insects, and fish and hence promoting biological productivity. 
(2)  Promote water conservation. The regulations are designed to promote conservation of potable and nonpotable water by encouraging the preservation of existing plant communities, encouraging the planting of natural or uncultivated areas, and encouraging the use of site-specific plant materials well-suited to soil moisture conditions. 
(3)  Preserve existing vegetation. The regulations are designed to preserve existing natural vegetation and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape. 
(4)  Removal of invasive species. The regulations encourage the control of certain exotic plant species which have become nuisances due to their tendency to damage public and private works, negatively affect the public health, and/or disrupt or destroy native ecosystems. 
(5)  Human values. The regulations provide direct and important physical, psychological, and economic benefits to human beings by regulating landscaping activities in order to ensure attractive landscapes, maintain historic waterfront views, break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspect of urban development, improve water quality, improve fisheries, improve recreational opportunities, and hence add value to homes and other waterfront property. 
(6)  Aesthetics. Forested riparian areas and littoral zone vegetation add to the natural beauty of lakes, wetlands, and other water bodies as well as provide means for passive recreation such as fishing, bird watching, and other activities. The regulations are designed to improve the aesthetic appearance of residential and non-residential areas by providing for incorporation of natural and planned open space in ways that will harmonize and enhance the natural and artificial environment. 
(7)  Improved administration and enforcement. The requirements establish procedures and standards for the administration and enforcement of this chapter, integrated and consistent with other provisions of the City Code. 
(b)  Shoreline alteration permit. No person shall cause to be performed any shoreline alteration, including the removal of shoreline or waterfront vegetation, without first obtaining a City of Maitland Shoreline Alteration Permit in conformance with this section. Shoreline alteration permits shall be obtained in addition to plant management permits issued by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC) Invasive Plant Management Section. No wetland vegetation shall be trimmed, cut, or removed from any shoreline, wetland, or waterway without a City of Maitland Shoreline Alteration Permit, unless the activity is exempt per subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(1)  No permit shall be required for the following: 
a.  Any person clearing less than fifty (50) feet or fifty (50) percent of the shoreline frontage, whichever is less. 
b.  Any person clearing vegetation within the physical foot print of a dock, gazebo or boathouse approved for construction by the city. 
c.  Lawn mowing, trimming of landscape, and other lawn maintenance activities which do not result in the clearing of vegetation below the normal high water elevation. 
d.  The repair or maintenance of an existing stormwater or drainage control system. 
e.  Routine shoreline maintenance. 
(2)  Applicants for a shoreline alteration permit shall submit a proposed site plan, photographs or drawings showing existing conditions, and information addressing the following items: 
a.  The area, and types of shoreline and waterfront vegetation proposed to be removed and to be maintained; 
b.  A plant survey showing the location and size of any trees, shrubs, and clumps of vegetation in association with the shoreline and littoral zone (shoreline area including all land six (6) inches above the normal high water elevation and less to a maximum of three (3) feet of water depth below the normal high water elevation); 
c.  A plan showing any proposed changes in shoreline contour, including existing and proposed topographical elevations, and the location and quantities of material to be removed and/or filled, in cubic yards (Note: An approved dredge and fill permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Environmental Resource Permitting Division is required prior to issuance of a city permit); 
d.  A plan showing the proposed method for erosion control, soil stabilization, sediment and turbidity control, and stormwater filtering and nutrient reduction; and 
e.  The vegetation removal methods proposed such as hand removal, mechanical removal, or chemical treatment. 
f.  The reasons for the request for the permit, the stated need for vegetation removal, and an explanation of the hardship incurred if a permit is not granted. 
(3)  A permittee is allowed to maintain a cleared access corridor not to exceed fifty (50) feet in width or fifty (50) percent of the shoreline, whichever is less. Vegetation within such an access corridor may be cleared from the normal high water elevation, (NHWE) (listed in Table 8-1, also in sections 11-78, et seq. of the City Code, Boat Dock Ordinance) of the lake out to navigable open water. The remainder of the shoreline must have vegetation present. In areas of shoreline where vegetation must remain present, a permittee has the option of leaving the existing plants or removing any nuisance or non-native vegetation and replanting the entire affected area with beneficial vegetation ("mitigation"), or native aquatic plants. Previously denuded areas outside of the access corridor must also be planted with native aquatic vegetation. 
(4)  Wetlands preserved in their natural state shall not be required to have additional shoreline landscaping. 
(5)  All cleared or trimmed vegetation shall be immediately removed from the lake, shoreline area, and dock for upland disposal offsite. 
(6)  Revegetation required after clearing shall be completed within ninety (90) days from the date the shoreline alteration permit is issued. A survival rate of eighty (80) percent shall be required to be maintained one (1) year after planting. If compliance is not achieved within one year, additional plantings shall be required until a survival rate of eighty (80) percent is met. 
(7)  Shoreline planting standards. Littoral zones shall be planted with vegetation throughout all impacted areas outside of the access corridor. Revegetated areas shall encompass the same percentage of shoreline coverage that was previously present. All emergent aquatic plants shall be planted a maximum of two (2) feet on center, unless, due to size or type of plantings, the city approves an alternate spacing plan. 
(8)  Nothing in this section is intended to relieve a property owner or contractor of any obligation under state law to obtain required permits from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction when applicable. 
(c)  Shoreline alteration regulations. Any (1) digging or adding of fill which alters or changes the shoreline or existing topography of the shoreline or waterfront of any water body within the city or (2) any removal of any shoreline or waterfront vegetation shall be prohibited, unless done in accordance with an approved shoreline alteration permit. 
(1)  The city manager or his/her designee shall investigate potential violations of this section and report them to the code enforcement board or special magistrate pursuant to the code enforcement procedures found in Chapter 5.3 of the Maitland City Code. 
(2)  If the code enforcement board or special magistrate finds that a violation of this section has occurred, the following guidelines shall be used for the application of penalties. 
a.  Remedial action shall be taken to restore the property consistent with a restoration plan approved by the city manager or his/her designee. The restoration plan shall include payment of required permit fee and may require vegetation and/or tree replacement and required mitigation of any other damage to the property. Remedial action must be taken within sixty (60) days or as approved by the code enforcement board or special magistrate. The decision of the code enforcement board or special magistrate shall be final. 
b.  Tree removal. Removal of four-inch DBH or greater trees within the shoreline protection area is a violation of this section unless done in accordance with the permit and density requirements of section 8-7.2 of the Maitland City Code. Violations shall be remedied by one or more of the following means: 
1.  Replacement at a ratio of one time the cumulative diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees removed to the cumulative caliper of trees to be installed (twenty (20) inches removed = twenty (20) inches replaced). Replacement trees shall be subject to city approval as sustainable in the location where the tree(s) are to be planted. Replacement trees shall have a two-year warranty. 
2.  Payment into a dedicated lake and wetland restoration/enhancement fund equal to the cost of replacement. The cost of replacement shall be determined based on the DBH of the removed or damaged tree. 
i.  Trees less than twenty (20) inches in caliper DBH: Ninety dollars ($90.00) per inch. 
ii.  Trees more than twenty (20) inches in caliper DBH: Three hundred sixty dollars ($360.00) per inch. 
3.  Trees that are considered to be a hazard to life, health, or human safety are exempt from these conditions and may be removed from within the shoreline protection area upon written approval by the city manager or his/her designee. 
(3)  Revocation of permit: Any permit issued may be revoked by the city for violation of, or noncompliance with, the provisions of a permit, this chapter, mistake of fact, or conflict with other city, county, or state regulations. 
(4)  Permitting appeals: Any person or persons aggrieved by a final decision of the city regarding issuance, revocation, denial, or modification of a permit shall have the right to appeal. The appeal shall be carried out as follows: 
The aggrieved party shall submit, in writing, the reasons for the appeal and the basis for the dispute. Such appeal shall be made to the Maitland City Council via submission to the Lakes Management Coordinator within thirty (30) calendar days of the decision being appealed. The appeal will then be scheduled for the next available meeting of the city council. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
(d)  Shoreline area planting requirements. All development and redevelopment occurring on property adjacent to surface water bodies, wetlands, or canals, or which include a wet retention design, shall be planted with native aquatic vegetation. Property owners are encouraged to plant a variety of different aquatic species to promote biodiversity. 
(1)  The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FLEPPC) provides biannually updated lists of species considered to be most invasive or potentially most invasive in Florida. "Category I" plants on this list are considered to be non-native invasive plants that are currently disrupting native plant communities in certain areas or throughout the state. "Category II" plants have the potential to disrupt native plant communities. No Category I or Category II plants shall be permitted to be planted on any waterfront parcel within the City of Maitland. A list of these species can be found at the City of Maitland Public Works Department. It is prohibited to install any aquatic plant listed on the prohibited aquatic plant list established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. A copy of the FLEPPC list can be obtained at the Maitland Public Works Department. 
(2)  The normal high water elevation elevations for the city's lakes are listed in Table 8-1. For water bodies not shown on the table but connected hydrologically, the elevations for the appropriate, connected lake shall be used. For wetlands and other water bodies, a formal wetland delineation may be required.

(e)  Sand beaches and play areas. Sand brought in to the shoreline protection area must be stabilized and retained above the normal high water elevation to prevent migration into the water body. The intent of this portion of this section is to preserve the natural shoreline ecosystem by ensuring that upland landscape designs, including sand, stabilize the yard and shoreline in such a manner that it shall not be carried into the lake or onto adjacent properties. Sand entering the lake accelerates the natural filling of the water body, alters the shape of the natural shoreline, and negatively impacts benthic organisms and littoral zone plants. To stabilize sand, these requirements must be met: 
(1)  A berm and swale system, designed to contain the sand, shall be installed parallel to the shoreline in such a manner that it retains the sand in place during a rain event. 
(2)  A containment barrier made of railroad ties, landscape logs, or similar structures made of concrete, vinyl, or stone shall be installed parallel and perpendicular to the shoreline in a manner that retains the sand in place above the NHWE during a rain event. 
(f)  Fences and walls. Fences, walls and hedges shall not protrude into the lake beyond the normal high water elevation (NHWE) of the lake. See also section 21-5(III) of the Maitland City Code. 
(g)  Retaining walls and seawalls. All seawalls are required to be landscaped with aquatic vegetation along the entire length of the littoral zone except for within the access corridor which may be maintained clear for swimming and recreational purposes. For the purposes of this section access corridor shall include any areas devoted to docks, boathouses, or other waterfront structures. All seawalls and retaining walls shall be constructed in accordance with Chapter 11, section 11-79 of the Maitland City Code. 
(h)  Chemicals in the shoreline protection area. The intent of this section is to reduce the amount of chemicals and nutrients leaching through upland soils and entering lakes and waterways. In lakes, terrestrial chemicals not designed for aquatic use can stimulate algal growth, kill invertebrates and small fish, and destroy lake edge landscaping and desired aquatic plants. 
(1)  The use of all fertilizers as well as reclaimed water and non aquatic use pesticide is hereby prohibited within the twenty-five-foot setback from the water's edge within the shoreline protection area. Only herbicides labeled for aquatic use shall be applied below the NHWE of a water body in strict accordance with Chapter 62C-20.0055 of the Florida Administrative Code and per the aquatic plant management permit issued by Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
(2)  A twenty-five-foot fertilizer free shoreline protection area is hereby required wherein no fertilizers or non aquatic use pesticide shall be applied. The twenty-five-foot setback shall be established upland from the normal high water elevation. 
(3)  Upland waterfront areas shall be fertilized in strict accordance with Chapter 15 Article XVII of the Orange County Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 1196, § 2, 4-12-10; Ord. No. 1233, § 2, 11-26-12) 
Sec. 8-15. - Parking lot landscape regulation. 
(a)  Applicability. All areas used for display or parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats or equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use, hereinafter referred to as "other vehicular uses," including but not limited to activities of a drive-in nature such as, filling stations grocery and dairy stores, banks, restaurants, and the like, shall conform to the minimum landscaping requirements hereinafter provided. The parking lot area is to be measured from the edge of the parking and/or driveway paving and sidewalks, but is not to include any area enclosed by the building or covered by a building overhang, or included as part of the required buffer yard. 
(b)  Interior plantings. All interior landscaped areas of the parking lot not dedicated to trees or to preservation of existing vegetation shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, shrubs, or other appropriate landscape treatment. Sand or other pavement shall not be considered appropriate landscape treatment. All landscaped areas in or adjacent to a vehicular use area shall be protected from vehicular damage by a raised concrete or other curb of at least six (6) inches in height or wall of at least thirty (30) inches in height. Likewise, the parking spaces, loading areas and service areas shall ensure that no vehicle overhangs encroach the walkways on the site. 
(1)  Interior landscaping. Interior areas of parking lots shall contain planter islands so as to best relieve the expanse of paving. Planter islands must be spaced no further apart than every one hundred (100) feet and at the terminus of all rows of parking. Planting islands shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width and must average one hundred and sixty-two (162) square feet in area for single parking rows and three hundred and twenty-four (324) square feet in area for double parking rows. 
(2)  Planter islands. All required planter islands must contain a minimum of one (1) shade/canopy tree or two (2) intermediate trees for every one hundred and sixty-two (162) square feet or less of area. Trees in the planter islands do not count as credit towards the perimeter trees. The remainder shall be landscaped with shrubs, lawn, ground cover other approved material not to exceed thirty (30) inches in height. 
(3)  Shrub requirements. Shrubs shall be required at a minimum rate of one (1) shrub per two hundred (200) total square feet of parking lot area, exclusive of perimeter plantings. 
(c)  Perimeter screening. All parking lots and vehicular use areas shall be screened from all abutting properties, rights-of-way, and exterior building walls with a wall, hedge or other durable landscape barrier. Any living barrier shall be established in a five-foot minimum wide planting strip. A non-living barrier shall be a minimum of four (4) feet high. In addition, one (1) tree in each thirty (30) lineal feet or fraction thereof and sixty (60) shrubs for every one hundred (100) lineal feet or fraction thereof shall be provided in the perimeter landscape planting area. The remainder of the required landscaped areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other approved landscape treatment excluding paving. All property other than the required landscaped strip lying between the right-of-way and off-street parking area or other vehicular use area shall meet the requirements for the buffer yard. This shall include any off-property swale between the actual pavement of a public street or alley and the right-of-way/property line. 
    Provisions of this section may be waived where a proposed parking area or other vehicular use area abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier. In this instance, the existing vegetation may be used to satisfy the landscape barrier requirements of this subsection provided that it meets all the provisions of this chapter for parking lot perimeter screening. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-16. - Loading area landscape regulations. 
    All loading, display with a minimum width of fifteen (15) feet or more, and utility service areas not screened by an intervening building, established after the application date of this chapter and all pre-existing areas which are required shall be screened from view from any public street rights-of-way for their entire length except for necessary access. 
    Screening for loading areas may be accomplished by a closed fence or wall which is at least six (6) feet high and is compatible with the principal building. Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than two-thirds of the surface area of the closed fence or wall is visible from the street within three (3) years of erection of the structure. The screening may also be accomplished with a natural evergreen plant material which can be expected to reach six (6) feet or greater within two (2) years of planting. Any plant materials used to fulfill these requirements shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height when planted, and there shall be no gap greater than two (2) feet between plant foliage. Access points to the dumpster must also be screened with gates if it is visible from the road or public right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-17. - Alternate methods of compliance. 
(a)  Stormwater retention/detention facilities as landscape. Stormwater retention/detention facilities shall qualify as perimeter or interior landscaping if two (2) or more of the following criteria are met, as determined by the parks and recreation director. 
(1)  The stormwater facility is integrated into the landscape and site design; 
(2)  The side slopes of the stormwater facility are 4:1 or less and the depressions or swales appear as a lawn or landscaped area; 
(3)  The stormwater facility can be used as a passive recreation area; 
(4)  The stormwater facility is designed as an entrance feature to the site development; 
(5)  The stormwater wet retention facility incorporates approved aquatic plants, as listed in Figure 1, page 20. 
(6)  The stormwater wet retention facility includes a water feature such as a fountain or spray jet. 
    Developments that utilize stormwater retention/detention facilities as perimeter or interior landscaping shall qualify for the following incentives: 
(1)  An allowance to encroach up to fifty (50) per cent into the transitional protective yard; 
(2)  Credit for up to twenty-five (25) per cent of the area to be used in buffer yard or interior calculations; 
(3)  Credit for up to one hundred (100) per cent of the permeable area to be used in open space calculations. 
    Stormwater retention/detention facilities which qualify as perimeter or interior landscape shall be maintained as such. 
(b)  Pre-existing parking lot landscape requirements. For sites with pre-existing parking lot improvements, developers are permitted to choose between two (2) design alternatives. The first requires land to be set aside in the form of interior islands and perimeter landscape strips, as established in this chapter for parking lot landscape. The second design alternative permits the developer to eliminate interior islands where the developer illustrates an increase in tree canopy through increased tree planting. The design option is only available, however, if parking stalls are laid out so that four (4) stalls intersect and five-foot by five-foot planters (measured as planting area only and not border) are installed between stalls to allow for tree installation. Furthermore, no vehicular encroachment is permitted into landscape areas. 
(c)  Pre-existing parking lots and off-site alternatives. For a pre-existing development which cannot physically accomplish the minimum requirements of the landscape on site and the buffer yard landscape regulations of this chapter on the site, an alternative plan may be proposed to the city. This would entail the installation of trees, shrubs, other plantings and an irrigation system within the adjacent city rights-of-way, either on the shoulder or within the median, or on specific city properties approved for off-site vegetation. The alternative installation shall not receive credit to exceed twenty-five (25) per cent of the total requirements. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until the alternative landscape installation is complete and accepted by the City. 
(d)  New development costs for off-site preparation, installation and maintenance. Whenever the city shall approve the installation in medians or parkway areas within dedicated rights-of-way of landscaping materials, irrigation systems or street lighting fixtures which exceed minimum city standards, it shall be authorized for the city to contract with private persons or firms to maintain such installations. Such contract may authorize the city to contribute to the cost of such maintenance an amount not to exceed the cost which the city would have incurred to provide maintenance of a standard right-of-way of comparable size within its corporate limits, as well as the utility costs which the city otherwise would pay for standard street lighting fixtures; provided, that in no event shall any such contract have a term in excess of five (5) years. 
(e)  Pre-existing parking lot and structures where landscape improvement costs exceed thirty (30) per cent of construction proposed for site. For properties which are submitting for site (sign, pavement) or structural alterations, expansions or renovations, and where the costs for approved landscape and irrigation improvements required by this Chapter exceed thirty (30) per cent of the proposed site or/and structural improvements, then the property owner may contract with the city to install the required landscape and irrigation improvements over a set time period, such period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of development approval. To qualify for this option, the property owner must execute an agreement with the city outlining the scheduled improvements in a phased plan of improvements. A minimum of twenty-five (25) per cent of the required improvements must be completed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Finally, where off-site mitigation is required, installation of these improvements must also be included in the schedule and agreement. Any such agreement may be approved by the city manager, with appeal of any decision to be determined by city council. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
ARTICLE VI. - SPECIFIC IRRIGATION REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 8-18. - Irrigation standards. 
    The irrigation system shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Florida Irrigation Society Standards and Specifications for Turf and Landscape Systems (revised June 10, 1988), as amended from time to time. All watering of planted areas should be managed so as to maintain healthy flora, make plant material more drought tolerant, avoid excessive turf growth, minimize fungus growth, stimulate deep root growth, minimize leaching of fertilizer, and minimize cold damage. 
(1)  Irrigation system required. Irrigation systems, either manual or automatic, must be used for the cultivated landscape areas in multi-family or commercial sites. Temporary irrigation systems shall be required to establish planting areas not intended to be permanently irrigated. Temporary irrigation systems shall be designed on the approved landscape plan. 
(2)  Preserved ecological communities. Existing plant communities and ecosystems, maintained in a natural state, do not require and shall not have any additional irrigation water added in any form. 
(3)  Zoning of irrigation systems. Wherever feasible, sprinkler heads irrigating high water demand landscape areas shall be circuited so that they are on a separate zone or zones from those irrigating trees, shrubbery or other reduced water requirement areas. 
(4)  Automatic irrigation systems. Whenever possible, automatic irrigation systems should be operated between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. Irrigating during these hours reduces fungus growth and loss of water due to evaporation. 
(5)  Elimination of overthrow onto nonpervious areas. Landscape irrigation systems shall be designed so that, to the greatest extent practical, water being applied to nonpervious areas is eliminated. Sprinkler heads shall be placed as required to reduce direct overthrow onto nonpervious areas. 
(7)  Control systems. Any person who purchases and installs an automatic lawn sprinkler system shall install a rain sensor device or switch which will override the irrigation cycle of the sprinkler system when adequate rainfall has occurred. 
(8)  Greywater use mandated. When greywater lines are made available to areas within the city, all properties within two hundred (200) feet of the available lines shall connect to such system for irrigation purposes within sixty (60) days after notification to do so by the director of public works. All connections shall be consistent with applicable regulations of the city and other regulatory agencies. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
ARTICLE VII. - MAINTENANCE

Landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Any dead vegetation and landscaping material shall be promptly replaced with healthy, living plantings. 
(1)  Maintenance of natural plant communities. All open space areas that are to be preserved as natural plant communities shall be cleared a minimum of yearly of all exotic vegetation, lawn grasses, trash or other debris. All natural plant communities shall be managed in order to maintain the plant community for the purpose it was preserved. 
a.  Required management plan. When applicable, the city shall make periodic inspections of the natural areas to verify the owner's adherence to the approved management plan as specified. 
b.  Mechanical equipment shall not be used. There shall be no use of mechanical equipment in accomplishing the maintenance of preserved plant communities unless specifically authorized in writing by the city. 
(2)  Maintenance of irrigation systems. Irrigation systems shall be constantly maintained to eliminate waste of water due to loss of heads, broken pipes or misadjusted nozzles. Repairs or replacements shall be replaced within seven (7) days after notification. 
(3)  Wall maintenance. Any wall or fence constructed in the city shall be maintained in a good condition on the side visible from public right-of-way or adjoining properties. This includes, but is not limited to, keeping the structure clean of dirt and debris, completely painted or colored with stucco, if masonry, and in good structural repair. 
(4)  Replacement requirements. Over the life of all installations, the landscape shall be maintained according to good horticultural practices. Vegetation which is required to be planted or preserved by this chapter shall be replaced with equivalent vegetation if it is not living. Within fifteen (15) days after notification, equivalent vegetation shall be installed according to the minimum requirements established in this chapter, subject to the approval of the city. 
(5)  Pesticide regulation compliance. Persons, corporations, businesses or any others who apply pesticides, and/or any other regulated substances, shall comply with all applicable local, state and federal regulations as amended. 
(6)  Duty to trim, remove when threatening public places. It shall be the duty of any private property owner to remove any dead, diseased or dangerous trees or shrubs, or parts thereof, which overhang or interfere with the public sidewalks, rights-of-way or property owned by the city when such trees or shrubs originate on or in front of said private property. 
(7)  All trees planted in conformance with the city's landscape code shall be allowed to grow to maturity. Pruning shall only be executed to allow for vehicular, pedestrian and utility clearances, as well as to promote the health of the trees. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95; Ord. No. 995, § 76, 3-27-00) 
ARTICLE VIII. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 8-20. - Certificate of Occupancy. 
    The city shall inspect all landscaping and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless the landscaping meets the requirements herein provided. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-21. - Appeal. 
    Any person or persons or any board, taxpayer, department, or bureau of the city, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision, administratively by an official of the city or by a committee or board of the city, may petition for interpretation to applicable boards or committees as outlined in other applicable regulations of the city. For matters not governed by other city regulations, the aggrieved party or parties may petition the city council to review the decision. The petition for appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the written determination subject to the appeal. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95) 
Sec. 8-22. - Violation and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. A violation or alleged violation of any requirements of this chapter may be filed by any person(s). A sworn complaint signed by the complainant may be submitted in writing to the city manager or designee. If the complaint is not transmitted in writing and signed by the complainant, the alleged violation shall be investigated and validated prior to initiation of enforcement procedures. All complaints received shall be recorded. 
Upon verification of the legitimacy of the complaint, the city shall forward a notice of violation to the property owner of record as listed in the most current tax rolls from Orange County. It shall cite the section(s) of the code(s) which is alleged to have been violated and allow fifteen (15) days in which to comply with the code. The fifteen (15) days shall be measured from the third day after placing the notification letter by U.S. mail, properly addressed and postage fee paid, return receipt requested. 
At the conclusion of the fifteen (15) days, a follow-up report shall be forwarded to the code enforcement officer. It shall at a minimum contain the city's interpretation of the code section violated, a copy of the section of the code alleged to have been violated, and any supplemental information which may assist in the disposition of the case. 
Should the city consider the violation a safety or health concern, then the city may proceed to take the appropriate actions to bring the violation into compliance. The costs of any corrective action taken by the city, including administrative costs, shall be assessed against the owners of the property. 
(b)  Penalties for violations. Violations of the provisions or failure to comply with any of the requirements therein shall be subject to code enforcement proceedings and penalties set forth in Chapter 5.3, Code Enforcement, of the Maitland City Code. 
The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, building contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may individually be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer code enforcement proceedings and penalties set forth herein and in Chapter 5.3. 
Vegetation abuse, accidental or intentional, and/or removal from any site without a vegetation removal permit or applicable permit shall subject the owner of said property to a maximum fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each infraction thereof. In addition, after staff review of the damaged site the owner shall be responsible for replacement of twice the equivalent value of the total diameter breast height (DBH) inches of destroyed and damaged trees. All other vegetation removed without a vegetation removal permit shall subject the owner of said property to a minimum replacement value assessment equal to thirty-five (35) percent of the removed or damaged understory vegetation. The city may also refuse a building permit, have water service discontinued, issue a stop work order, or use any combination of measures as a penalty for violation of this article. 
Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. For instances where a stop work order has been issued by an authorized agent of the city, and the order is not followed, the violation shall be punished by a fine which shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not in excess of sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each and every time a stop work order is issued and not complied with shall constitute a separate violation. 
(Ord. No. 863, § 2, 1-23-95; Ord. No. 995, § 77, 3-27-00; Res. No. 5-2008, §§ 1, 2, 5-12-08)

Sec. 8-53. - Title and purpose. 
(a)  This ordinance shall be known as the "Wetlands Protection Ordinance of the City of Maitland, Florida." 
(b)  In accordance with the City of Maitland's 2030 Comprehensive Development Plan Conservation Element, the city hereby adopts wetlands impact regulations to protect, preserve and enhance the natural functions of wetlands within the city and prevent or mitigate activities which degrade or destroy the function of wetlands. 
(c)  It is the purpose and intent of this regulation to provide for the protection, maintenance, and utilization of wetlands within the city, recognizing the rights of individual property owners to use their lands in a reasonable manner as well as the right of all citizens to protection and purity of the waters of the city and their associated wetland ecosystems. 
(d)  It is the policy of the city to minimize the disturbance of wetlands in the city and to encourage their use only for the purposes which are compatible with their natural functions and environmental benefits. 
(e)  Wetlands serve important functions in the hydrologic cycle and ecological system including but not limited to: 
(1)  Wetlands provide temporary storage of surface waters during times of flood, thereby regulating flood elevations and the timing, velocity and rate of flood discharges; 
(2)  Wetlands protect water bodies by providing settling of suspended sediments, assimilation of nutrients, and uptake of other natural and manmade pollutants. Wetland vegetation filters sediment, organic matter, and chemicals. Microorganisms utilize dissolved nutrients and break down organic matter; 
(3)  Wetlands provide essential breeding and predator escape habitats for many forms of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and invertebrates; 
(4)  Wetlands provide essential habitat for many rare, endangered, and threatened species. 
(f)  It is further the purpose and intent of these regulations to ensure that there is no unavoidable net loss of wetlands function and acreage within the city. 
( Ord. No. 1317, § 2, 5-8-17 ) 
Sec. 8-54. - Wetland identification. 
(a)  Wetland boundaries shall be delineated in the field according to the state unified wetland delineation methodology. This delineation determines the final jurisdictional location and extent of wetlands and shall occur prior to any alteration on a site on which wetlands may be located.

    "Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant."

    "It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision. Therefore, the Department of Corrections is to provide intensive supervision by experienced correctional probation officers to conditional release offenders."

ARTICLE VI. - MOBILITY FEES 

Sec. 12-100. - Authority. 
(a)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Maitland Mobility Fee Ordinance." 
(b)  The City Council has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to Article VIII of the 1968 Florida Constitution, and Chapters 163 and 166 of the Florida Statutes, and the Charter of the City of Maitland. 
(c)  Planning for new multi-modal facility improvements needed to serve new growth and development that generate the need for additional improvements and the implementation of these plans through the comprehensive planning process, is a responsibility of the city under Section 163.3161 et seq., Florida Statutes, and is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-101. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  This article is intended to impose a mobility fee, payable prior to issuance of a building permit, in an amount based upon the average amount of new person miles of travel attributable to new development and the average cost of providing the multimodal capacity needed to serve such new travel. This article shall not be construed to authorize imposition of fees related to multimodal improvement needs attributable to existing development. 
(b)  This article is intended to allow new development in compliance with the Comprehensive Development Plan to share in the burdens of growth. New development shares in this burden by paying a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of multimodal facilities needed to accommodate the person miles of travel demands created by new development as well as by complying with other appropriate development approval conditions. This article is intended to provide flexibility to address the needs of individual developments that, because of location, timing, or other characteristics, require different treatment in the form of reduced fees or supplemental requirements. 
(c)  Towards this end, the mobility fees are replacing road impact fees adopted pursuant to Ordinance No. 764, as amended, and are based upon the calculation methodology incorporated in the "City of Maitland Mobility Fee Technical Report" prepared by NUE Urban Concepts, LLC dated July 2016.

(5)  The mobility fee is calculated on the basis of the person miles of travel generated from the land use. If the PMT increases due to a change in size or use, the fee due shall be the incremental difference resulting from the alteration, expansion or replacement as determined by the mobility fee schedule, less the fee that would be imposed under the applicable rate prior to the alteration, expansion or replacement. 
(6)  In the event that there is a change in use that results in a decrease in person miles of travel generated by the previously allowed use, the applicant shall not be entitled to a refund or credit. 
(7)  Any person who shall initiate any new impact generating land development activity shall, except as otherwise provided for herein, pay a mobility fee as set forth in the following mobility fee schedule:

Sec. 12-106. - Alternative mobility fee or special mobility fee determinations authorized. 
    In the event an applicant believes that the cost to mitigate the impact of the development of improvements needed to serve the applicant's proposed development is less than the fee established in this article, the applicant may request consideration of and submit an alternative mobility fee or special mobility fee determination request, along with a review fee as determined by the city, and support materials to substantiate the request to the mobility fee administrator pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the mobility fee administrator finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology used by the applicant to calculate the alternative mobility fee or special mobility fee satisfy the requirements of this article, the alternative mobility fee or special mobility fee shall be deemed the mobility fee due and owing for the proposed development. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-107. - Procedure for review of alternative mobility fee or special mobility fee determinations. 
    The mobility fee administrator is responsible for calculating mobility fees in accordance with the provisions of this article. If an applicant believes project impacts are lower than justified by the findings of this article, or believes the proposed use is incorrectly assigned as identified in the mobility fee schedule, or that the assumptions that derive the mobility fee are not applicable to a specific proposed land use, an adjustment to the fees may be requested along with an application and review fee. The mobility fee administrator shall determine whether the request shall be reviewed as either an alternative mobility fee determination or a special mobility fee determination, based upon the impact of the proposed land use on the city's mobility. The process for reviewing alternative mobility fee determinations is listed below in section 12-108. The process for special mobility fee determinations for minor projects with significantly less impacts is found in section 12-109. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-108. - Alternative mobility fee determination. 
(a)  The alternative mobility fee determination shall be based on data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology contained in this article and the mobility fee technical report referred to in sections 12-103 herein, or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is (an) accepted standard source of transportation engineering or planning data or information; or 
(2)  The independent source is a local study carried out by a qualified planner or engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of planning or engineering; 
(3)  Where different data, information, assumptions, formulae or methodology are employed such differences shall be specially identified and justified. 
(b)  An alternative mobility fee calculation shall be undertaken through the submission of an application for review of an alternative mobility fee determination for the mobility fee component for which an alternative mobility fee calculation is requested. A developer shall submit such an application in conjunction with the submittal of any development plan or petition for new or redevelopment or as otherwise agreed to in a mobility fee agreement. The city may submit such an application for any proposed land development activity for which it concludes the nature, timing or location of the proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts costing substantially more to remedy than the amount of the fee that would be generated by the use of the mobility fee schedule included in this article. 
(c)  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of an application for review of an alternative mobility fee determination, the mobility fee administrator, shall determine if the application is complete. If the mobility fee administrator, determines that the application is not complete, a written statement specifying the deficiencies shall be sent to the applicant. The application shall be deemed complete if no deficiencies are specified. The mobility fee administrator shall take no further action on the application until it is deemed complete. 
(d)  When the mobility fee administrator determines the application is complete, the application shall be reviewed and a written decision shall be render in thirty (30) days, or as soon thereafter as possible, on whether the mobility fee should be modified, and if so, what the amount should be. 
(e)  If the mobility fee administrator finds that the data, information, assumptions, formulae and methodology used by the applicant to compute the alternative mobility fee calculation satisfies the requirements of this article, the re-determined mobility fee shall be deemed the mobility fee due and owing for the proposed land development activity. This adjustment in the fee shall be set forth in a mobility fee agreement which shall be entered into pursuant to section 12-110. 
(f)  A determination by the mobility fee administrator that the alternative mobility fee re-determination does not satisfy the requirements of this article may be appealed to the city council. 
(g)  The applicant shall be responsible for the full costs that the city may incur to review the alternative mobility fee data and methodology which may include consultant and legal costs. Payment will be due at the time of the request for the alternative calculations. 
(h)  An applicant who submits a proposed alternative mobility fee pursuant to this section and desires the issuance of a building permit or special use permit prior to the resolution of the pending alternative mobility fee shall pay the applicable mobility fee prior to, or at the time said applicant desires the building permit. Said payment shall be deemed paid "under protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights. Any difference in the amount of the mobility fee after the determination of the pending alternative mobility fee shall be refunded to the applicant. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-109. - Special mobility fee determination. 
    An applicant may request a special mobility fee determination for smaller, less intense projects when data and information are presented that substantiates that a project has unique characteristics other than those upon which the mobility fee calculation was based. It is the applicant's responsibility to submit adequate justification and support data to substantiate a lower impact to mobility fee administrator. The mobility fee administrator may review the request and ask for additional information. The applicant is responsible for additional costs that the city may incur to review these special requests, including consultant and legal costs. Payment will be due at the time of request for the determination. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-110. - Presumptions, agreements and security requirements. 
(a)  A proposed development shall be presumed to generate the maximum impact generated by the most intensive use permitted under the applicable land development regulations such as the comprehensive development plan or zoning regulations or under applicable deed or plat restrictions. 
(b)  In lieu of the payment of fees as calculated in sections 12-104(7) or 12-108 of this article, any applicant may propose to enter into a mobility fee agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which: 
(1)  Modify the presumption of maximum impact set forth in subsection (a) of this section and provide a mobility fee which may differ from that set forth in section 12-104(7) or 12-108 of this article by specifying the nature of the proposed development for purposes of computing actual impact, provided that the agreement shall establish legally enforceable means for ensuring that the impact will not exceed the impact generated by the agreed upon development; 
(2)  Permit the construction of specific improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the mobility fees assessable and/or pursuant to a payback schedule, allow the developer to recover the actual cost of such improvements in excess of the amount which would have been assessed by this article as subsequent users of such improvements obtained building permits and pay mobility fees. 
(3)  Permit a schedule and method for payment of the mobility fees in a manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of the proposed development in lieu of the requirements for payment of the fees as set forth in section 12-105, provided that security is posted ensuring payment of the fees, in a form acceptable to the city, which security may be in the form of a cash bond, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, negotiable certificate of deposit or escrow account, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit. 
(c)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection shall be presented to and approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgages, lienholders or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner, and may permit any party to record such agreement in the official records of Orange County. The city council shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-111. - Mobility fee credits. 
(a)  An applicant shall be entitled to a credit against any mobility fee assessed pursuant to this article in an amount equal to the cost of off-site multi-modal improvements or contributions of land, money or services for off-site mobility improvements contributed or previously contributed, paid for or committed to by the applicant or his predecessor in interest as a condition of any development order issued by the City of Maitland for the same development or for excess capacity created by the applicant or his predecessor in interest where such excess capacity is provided at the request of the city engineer or through a development order and credit for same is agreed to by the mobility fee administrator in advance of the creation of the excess capacity and provided for in a mobility fee agreement, subject to city council approval. 
(b)  Mobility fee specific credits are eligible for projects that have made a contribution or improvement to multi-modal facilities improvements beyond minimum-required mobility strategies in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Development Plan. Site access improvements for turn lanes, sidewalks, trails, round-a-bouts or traffic signals at project entrances or immediately adjacent improvements are not eligible for any credit. If an additional mobility fee credit remains from the prior eligible contribution, the remaining mobility fee credit shall be applied to the development occurring after the effective date of the mobility fee on a dollar for dollar basis. 
(c)  The amount of developer contribution credit to be applied to the mobility fee shall be determined according to the following standards of valuation: 
(1)  The appraised fair market land value of the contributed parcel as of the date of building permit, agreement to contribute, or contribution, whichever is earlier, as determined by an M.A.I. appraiser selected and paid for by the applicant. In the event the mobility fee administrator with the appraised value, he may engage another appraiser and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two (2) appraisals. No credit should be granted pursuant to this section unless the cost of the improvements were paid for and the contributions made within the last five (5) years; and 
(2)  The cost of anticipated construction of off-site improvements shall be based upon cost estimates certified by a professional engineer or registered planner, and such estimate shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. The city reserves the right to require the developer to competitively bid in accordance with the City Code, in which case the credit shall be limited to the actual cost or one hundred percent (100%) of the lowest responsible bid amount, whichever is less. All bidders shall be qualified to construct the off-site improvements; and 
(3)  Should the cost of the land conveyance and/or construction of the off-site improvements exceed the mobility fee due from the development project then the credit received by the applicant shall be limited to the mobility fee generated by the development project; and 
(d)  Prior to issuance of a building permit or special use permit, the applicant shall submit to the mobility fee administrator a proposed plan for the construction or conveyance of off-site improvements to the multi-modal network. 
The proposed plan shall include: 
(1)  A designation of the development project for which the plan is being submitted; 
(2)  A list of contemplated off-site improvements to the multi-modal network; 
(3)  A legal description of any land proposed to be donated and a written appraisal prepared in conformity with this section; 
(4)  An estimate of proposed construction costs based on detailed unit costs that are less than one-year-old and sealed by a professional engineer; and 
(5)  A proposed time schedule for completion of the proposed plan. 
(e)  Upon receipt of the proposed plan, the mobility fee administrator shall review the application and the proposed plan to determine if it complies with this section. The mobility fee administrator shall render a decision thirty (30) days following receipt of the proposed plan to grant or deny the credit. Failure to render a decision within forty-five (45) days shall be deemed a denial. 
(f)  If the request for credit is denied and the applicant wishes to appeal such denial, the applicant shall file a notice of appeal with the city manager, within thirty (30) days of the denial. The city manager shall render a decision within thirty (30) days of the notice of appeal. An applicant may appeal the city manager's decision to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city within thirty (30) days of the city manager's determination. The city council shall hear the appeal at the next available meeting. The decision of the city council shall be considered final administrative action, and shall be subject to court review based only upon the record established at the hearing before the council. An applicant shall have thirty (30) days to appeal the city council determination to circuit court by writ of certiorari. 
(g)  If a proposed plan of conveyance or construction is approved for credit by the mobility fee administrator, upon appeal, by the city manager or city council, the applicant and the city shall enter into a credit agreement which shall provide for the timing of the action to be taken by the applicant and the obligations and responsibilities of the parties, including but not limited to: 
(1)  The timing of actions to be taken by the applicant and the obligations and responsibilities of the applicant, including, but not limited to, the construction standards and requirements to be complied with; 
(2)  The obligations and responsibilities of the City, including, but not limited to, inspection of the project; and 
(3)  The amount of credit as determined in accordance with 12-111(c). 
(h)  All construction cost estimates shall be based upon and all construction plans and specifications shall be in conformity with the road construction standards of the city and any other jurisdiction having responsibility for the right-of-way and shall be approved by the city engineer prior to the commencement of construction. 
(i)  An applicant who submits a proposed plan pursuant to this section and desires the issuance of a building permit or special use permit prior to the resolution of the pending credit shall pay the applicable mobility fee prior to or at the time said applicant desires the building permit. Said payment shall be deemed paid "under protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any review rights. Any difference in the amount of mobility fee after the determination of the pending credit shall be refunded to the applicant or owner. 
(j)  Previous development permits or agreements prior to adoption of the mobility fee ordinance wherein voluntary road impact fees were specified and paid or obligated to be paid shall be binding as to any building permit already issued on land subject to the development permit. Improvements required by previous development permits shall not be given a credit unless they meet the requirements of subsection (a) above. 
(k)  Credit for contributions, payments, construction or dedications of a mobility fee shall not be transferable to another property where a mobility fee is imposed. 
(l)  Credit for redevelopment of existing uses shall be based upon the closest applicable land use per the mobility fee schedule in 12-104(7).

( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-112. - Mobility fee benefit district. 
(a)  The establishments of a citywide mobility fee benefit district to regulate mobility fee expenditures is the best method of ensuring that the mobility fees paid provide a benefit to the development which paid the mobility fees. The basis for the citywide benefit district are the existing citywide travel patterns which accommodating daily trips from development throughout the city and the compact nature of the city and the location of the boundaries of existing adjacent municipalities and counties. 
(b)  The citywide mobility fee benefit district provides a clearly defined boundary for the expenditure of mobility fee revenue. Using the citywide mobility fee benefit district ensures that funds paid by development are spent on projects to accommodate person miles of travel, providing a reasonable nexus between the expenditure of mobility fee revenue and the development for which the mobility fees are paid. (c) Based upon the foregoing, the mobility fee study concludes that the city should establish a citywide mobility fee benefit district. The boundary of the citywide mobility fee benefit district shall be the same as the city boundaries in effect at the time of the collection of any mobility fees within the city. The mobility fee benefit district, as depicted on map H in the mobility fee technical report adopted per 12-103 and described in this section, is hereby established. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-113. - Mobility fee funds account. 
    There is hereby established a separate mobility fee fund account. For accounting purposes, the mobility fee funds shall be considered special revenue funds.

Funds withdrawn from these accounts shall be used solely in accordance with the provision of section 12-114. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-114. - Mobility fee expenditures. 
(a)  Amounts on deposit in the mobility fee fund account shall be used by the city solely for designing and constructing multi-modal improvements or for financing directly, or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness, the costs of multi-modal facilities, or portions thereof, that are located in the mobility fee benefit district from which the funds were collected, that are funded or unfunded improvements identified in the city's capital improvement element and program, mobility plan, bicycle and pedestrian plan, trails plan, transit development plan, and are shown to provide a capacity benefit to new development located within the mobility fee benefit district. 
(b)  All funds shall be used exclusively for multi-modal improvements that add multi-modal capacity and accommodate person miles of travel through walking, bicycling, riding transit driving or sharing rides in a motor vehicle, along with other modes of travel that provide person mobility. 
(c)  The amounts on deposit in the mobility fee fund shall not be used for an expenditure that would be classified as a transportation operation and maintenance expense. 
(d)  Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this section. The disbursal of such funds shall require the approval of the city council upon recommendation of the city manager. 
(e)  Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts. Funds may be pooled for investment provided all income derived from the fund's assets shall be deposited in the applicable fund account. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-115. - Mobility fee refunds. 
    The fees collected pursuant to this article shall be returned to the then present owner of the development if the fees have not been encumbered or spent by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten (10) years from the date the fees were collected, or if the development for which the fees were paid was never begun, in accordance with the following procedure: 
    For purposes of this section, fees collected shall be deemed to be encumbered or expended on a "first in-first out" basis, i.e., the first money placed in a fee fund shall deemed to be the first money expended or encumbered. The following procedure will apply for requests for eligible refunds: 
(1)  The then present owner must petition the city council for the refund within one (1) year following the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten (10) years from the date on which the fee was received. 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property or his authorized agent; 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee or other competent evidence of payment; 
c.  A certificate of title or attorney's title opinion showing the petitioner to be the current owner of the property or his authorized agent; 
d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill; and 
e.  A copy of the building permit or development agreement pursuant to which the mobility fees were paid. 
(3)  Within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of petition for refund, the city manager or his designee shall advise the petitioner and the city council of the status of the fee requested for refund. For the purposes of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a trust fund account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account when withdrawals have been made in accordance with section 12-114. 
(4)  When the money requested is still in the trust fund account and has not been spent or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten (10) years from the date of the fees were paid, the money shall be returned with interest at the rate of two (2%) percent per annum. 
(5)  When a refund is requested because construction was never begun, all development order approvals shall have expired and the applicant shall execute an agreement acknowledging the expiration of development order approval. 
(6)  A request for a refund of impact fees or mobility fees must be made one (1) year from the issuance of the building permit or special use permit or six (6) months from the expiration of the permit whichever is later only if no development activity has started. The refund amount will be less ten (10%) percent of the fees that were ultimately to have been paid, regardless of the amount actually paid. If the applicant does not apply within the time limits stated above, there will be no refund. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-116. - Effect on land development regulations. 
(a)  The payment of mobility fees does not ensure nor grant compliance with the city's land development regulations, including regulations relating to transportation corridor management, access management, substandard roads, secondary access, timing and phasing, and, where applicable, development of regional impact review. However, if such regulations require transportation mitigation for the same impacts addressed through the payment of mobility fees, such regulations shall be deemed to provide for mobility fee credit against imposed mobility fees consistent with state and federal law and this article. 
(b)  The listing of a land use in the mobility fee schedule is solely for purposes of establishing the applicable mobility fee schedule for such use, and such listing does not mean that the land use is permitted or available under applicable zoning and comprehensive development plan requirements. In addition, the listing of the land use in the mobility fee schedule shall not be considered evidence that the land use is appropriate in any land use classification or zoning district. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-117. - Annual report. 
    The city shall comply with all audit requirements of Florida Statutes. The city shall include in its annual Capital Improvements Plan update an accounting of projects funded by mobility fees. The annual budget shall indicate mobility fee revenues and expenditures. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-118. - Review and update. 
(a)  This chapter shall be reviewed by the city council at least once every five (5) years unless a more frequent review is determined necessary by the city council or the city undertakes an update to the Comprehensive Development Plan that amends the mobility plan, which served as the basis for the mobility fee. The review and update shall consider all factors utilized in the most recent computation of mobility fees. However, in the event that a full reevaluation and update are not complete within the required five (5) year period, the last adopted mobility fee shall remain in effect until the reevaluation is complete. The purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of inflation on the actual costs of multi-modal improvements, and to ensure that the mobility fee charged on new land development activity will not exceed its reasonably anticipated expansion costs for capital improvements necessitated solely by its presence. 
(b)  To ensure that mobility fees keep pace with inflation, on January 1 st of each calendar year, the mobility fees in section 12-104(7) shall increase by the projected rate of inflation for the upcoming calendar year as determined by the most recent FDOT Transportation Cost Report Construction Cost Inflation Factors released on or about August of each calendar year. 
(c)  The city shall update the mobility fees in section 12-104(7) on or before September 30 th of each calendar year if necessary due to projected inflation per section 12-118(b) and shall advertise the fees in a publication of general circulation available to city residents and businesses or as permitted by State Statute, on the city's website. The advertisement shall be published and/or posted ninety (90) days prior to the increase of the mobility fees. 
(d)  The requirements of section 12-118(b) shall serve as notice to the public that mobility fees will increase on an annual basis, adjusted for inflation, and this section shall be deemed to address Statutory requirements that notice be provided ninety (90) days prior to an increase in a mobility fee. The notice requirement of section 12-118(c) is provided as a courtesy reminder. 
( Ord. No. 1314, § 3, 9-26-16 ) 
Sec. 12-119. - Development agreements.

(1)  Permit the construction of multi-modal facility improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the mobility fee otherwise assessable under section 12-104(7); 
(2)  Provide for a transfer of credits as provided for in section 12-111 to any successor in interest in land; 
(3)  Allow a schedule and method of payment of mobility fees in a manner different than provided in section 12-104(2). 
(b)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this section shall be presented to and approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit or special use permit. Any such agreement shall provide for execution by any mortgagees, lienholders, or contract purchasers in addition to the landowner, and shall require the applicant to record such agreement in the public records of Orange County. The city council shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the new agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with applicable Florida Statutes, case law and this article.

The city shall evaluate the petition and submit a recommendation to the city council based upon the following criteria: 
(1)  A valid, unexpired governmental act of the city, authorizing the building for which applicants seeks a certificate of occupancy, exists. 
(2)  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing act are reasonably equivalent to the fee required by section 12-104(7). 
(3)  That it would be inequitable to deny the applicant the opportunity to occupy a previously approved building under the conditions of the previous approval by requiring the applicant to comply with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  If an applicant has previously entered into a development agreement with the city with conditions regarding off-site multi-modal facility improvements, the applicant or applicant's successor in interest may request a modification of the prior development agreement in order to bring the conditions into consistency with this article. Applicant must file a request for such modification with the development review committee within one (1) year of the effective date of this article.

Sec. 15-7. - Access permits for connections to roads in state highway system. 
    Any person, firm or entity, including a governmental entity other than the City of Maitland, seeking to connect, alter or improve access to the state highway system within the City of Maitland must first apply for and receive an access permit from the city. Such access permit shall be in addition to any permit required by the Florida Department of Transportation ("DOT") as a prerequisite to connection to the state highway system, and receipt of an access permit from the city neither relieves the recipient from the necessity to obtain a permit from DOT nor guarantees the right to connect to the state highway system. Application for access permits shall be processed in the following manner: 
(1)  Any person, firm or entity, including a governmental entity other than the City of Maitland, seeking to connect, alter or improve access to any portion of the state highway system within the city, must first file an application for access permit. Such application shall, at a minimum, include: the name and address of the person, firm or entity seeking to connect, alter or improve access; the street address or legal description of the parcel of land on which the improvement is proposed to be placed, as well as a statement of all persons owning any legal or beneficial rights in such land; a statement as to what type of vehicular use the improvement will be put, including estimates of average and peak vehicle trips per day over such improvement, an assessment of the resulting effects on the level of service for the roadway and the two (2) closest intersections, and the increase if any to average or peak hour vehicle trips per day over the road to which the improvement gives access; a statement as to what construction materials will be used in the improvement including an estimate of the duration of such construction; and a scale sketch of the proposed improvement when completed, accurately depicting dimensions, elevations, grade, angle of intersection with right-of-way, and any curbs, gutters, sidewalks, gates, existing and proposed signals and traffic control signage, or other associated improvements. For the purpose of administering this section, the word "improvements" shall mean "any construction activity undertaken upon or adjacent to any roadway which is a part of the state highway system within the City of Maitland, whether or not publicly dedicated, for any purpose related to widening or repairing existing access." This definition is intended to include all improvements of every kind to roadways and adjacent real property which could in any way affect traffic volumes on the state highway system within the city, and should be read broadly so as to effectuate that intent. 
(2)  The application shall be accompanied by payment to the city of an application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Until this fee has been paid, no action shall be taken on any application. 
(3)  Following submission of the application for access permit, the director of public works ("director") shall have a period of not more than ninety (90) days for staff review of the proposed connection. Should the department of public works ("the department") determine that a longer review period is required to thoroughly assess the probable impact of the proposed connection upon the city, the director shall notify the applicant at least fourteen (14) business days before the expiration of the aforementioned ninety-day period that extended review will be necessary. The department shall evaluate the proposed connection in light of its probable effects upon the state highway system, traffic flow and vehicular congestion, public safety, quality of life and the natural environment within the city. 
(4)  The following are hereby adopted as minimum standards for the department to use in evaluating access permit applications, and the department is hereby authorized to adopt such further standards as it finds necessary to achieve the ends expressed in subsections (2) of this section. 
a.  The standards contained in the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Maitland; 
b.  The standards contained in the DOT manual, "Policy and Guidelines for Vehicular Connections to the State Highway System"; 
c.  The standards contained in Florida Administrative Code Rule 9J-2.055 for measuring traffic volume; specifically, "Level of Service" as defined in F.A.C. Rule 9J-02.055(3)(e), and "peak hour vehicle trips" by which such levels of service are computed. The department shall deny a permit for any improvement which the department estimates will result in either: 
1.  A ten per cent (10%) or greater increase in average or peak vehicle trips per day; or 
2.  Reduction of the level of service of the roadway to which an applicant desires to make an improvement. 
(5)  If the director finds that the proposed access will meet the requirements of this section, he shall issue a permit therefor. The director is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued by him pursuant to this section, upon the failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provision of this section. Any decision or action made or taken by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed in writing to the city council within thirty (30) days after any such decision or action. 
(6)  This section shall be enforced, and violations hereof shall be punished, as provided by law.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 16-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Land subdivision is the first step in community development. Once land has been subdivided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads, drainage and utilities must be maintained and various customary municipal services must be provided. The welfare of the entire city is directly affected by land subdivision. It is to the interest of all taxpayers and citizens, the developer and future residents that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound practice and appropriate standards. 
    The intent and purpose of these regulations is to provide for the harmonious development of the city; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic; and to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation, potable water, flood prevention, drainage, sewers, other sanitary facilities and city services. 
    In addition to the minimum requirements for construction of such improvements as roads and drainage, compliance with the intent of these regulations requires that good design be practiced in subdivision planning, valuable and scenic natural features conserved and adequate open space be made available for public use. Subdivision design should be adapted to the peculiarities and opportunities of the site, should utilize contemporary, imaginative design and should avoid monotonous repetition of a wasteful pattern of gridiron layouts and long, straight minor or collector streets. Size, shape and orientation of lots and blocks should be carefully considered with relation to future use of the various lots to be created. 
    It is intended that this chapter shall be construed liberally in the favor of the city. 
(Code 1971, § 16-1) 
Sec. 16-2. - Jurisdiction. 
    The regulations herein set out shall apply to all lands presently within the limits of the city and to any lands which may in the future be annexed to and be made a part of the city. No land shall be subdivided unless such subdivision conforms to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1971, § 16-2) 
Sec. 16-3. - Applicability. 
(a)  In order to subdivide land and file a plat thereon, except merely to record the boundaries of an ownership, all requirements as set out in this chapter shall be met and the procedures as herein set forth shall be followed. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-4(23), the sale or exchange of small parcels of land to or between adjoining property owners, where such sale or exchange does not create additional lots, shall not be considered a subdivision of land. 
(Code 1971, § 16-3; Ord. No. 995, § 98, 3-27-00) 
Sec. 16-4. - Definitions.

(7)  Easement. Any strip of land created by a subdivider for public or private utilities, drainage, sanitation, or other specified uses having limitations, the title to which shall remain in the name of the property owner, subject to the right of use designated in the reservation of the servitude. The granting of such an easement will be an express grant which may or may not be recorded. In any case, the public, when benefited by the easement, will be known as the "dominant" estate and the property which is subject to the easement will be known as the "servient" estate. The easement runs with the land and the "dominant" estate will have full rights to use the easement for the stated purpose and full rights to permit or deny use of the easement to any other party including the "servient" estate for any purpose whatsoever.

(13)  Lot, depth. As defined by the city zoning code. 
(14)  Lot, width. As defined by the city zoning code. 
(15)  Plat.

(23)  Subdivision. The division of land into three or more lots, parcels, tracts, tiers, blocks, sites, or units, or any other division of land. The term includes establishment of new streets and alleys, additions, and resubdivisions; and, when appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the lands or area subdivided. 
(24)  Surveyor. Refers to a land surveyor registered in Florida, and engaged by the developer to survey and prepare the plat of the land proposed for subdivision. 
(25)  Used. The words used or occupied include the words intended, designed or arranged to be used or occupied.

(a)  Authorized. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the planning and zoning commission in the case of a plan and program for a new town, a complete community, or a neighborhood unit, which in the judgment of the planning and zoning commission provided adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, which will provide such covenants or other legal provisions as will insure conformity to and achievement of the city plan for development, and which will insure that such development will not constitute an economic and tax burden on the city. 
(b)  Conditions. In granting modifications, the planning and zoning commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards and requirements so modified. 
(Code 1971, § 16-13) 
Sec. 16-7. - Conflicting regulations. 
    Whenever any provisions of this chapter impose more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the provisions of any other law, ordinance, regulation or restrictive covenant, then the provisions of this chapter shall govern.

Two-family or multifamily subdivisions ..... 2 acres/75 DU's 
(2)  Fees in lieu of land. The amount of fee shall be based on the fair market value of the developed land which would otherwise have been required according to the land formula. Developed land is defined as land within an approved subdivision in which all required improvements have been constructed and accepted by the city. The amount of such fee shall be based upon an average estimated fair market value per subdivided developed acre located within the city. 
(D)  USE OF FUNDS COLLECTED; MANNER OF LAND CONVEYANCE. 
(1)  All money collected hereunder shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and/or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the residential development, by way of purchase of necessary land, or for improving of such land already acquired for these purposes. If the city council deems there are sufficient recreational or park areas available for the development, then the money may be used for improving other land for park and/or recreational purposes within the city. 
(2)  All land conveyed to the city shall be in fee simple title. 
(E)  PROCEDURE. At the time of approval of the preliminary plat, the city council shall determine pursuant to this section the land to be dedicated and/or the fees to be paid by the developer. The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive. At the time of approval of the final plat, and prior to signing of the record plat, the developer shall convey such land or pay such fee in lieu thereof as was determined by the city council.

(b)  For the purpose of compensating the seller of telecommunication service the seller shall be allowed one (1) percent of the amount of the tax collected and due to the city in the form of a deduction from the amount collected for remittance. The deduction shall be allowed as compensation for the keeping of records and for the collection of, and the remitting of, the tax. The deduction shall not be allowed in the event of an untimely return, unless the seller has in writing requested and been granted an extension of time for filing such return. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the event the total amount of tax anticipated to be collected within a calendar quarter does not exceed one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00), the seller of telecommunication service may, with written authorization of the city, remit the taxes collected during such quarter to the city quarterly. In such case, the tax shall be due on or before the 20th day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which the taxes were collected.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 17.5-1. - Legislative findings, intent and purpose. 
(1)  The general purpose is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of communication towers and telecommunications facilities in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in Maitland, Florida. 
(2)  The City of Maitland has on numerous occasions and with increasing frequency been confronted with requests to site communications towers. Prior to the adoption of this chapter, no specific procedures existed to address recurrent issues related to siting communication towers. Accordingly, the city council of the City of Maitland finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary: 
(a)  To direct the location of communication towers in the city; 
(b)  To protect residential areas and other land uses from potential adverse impacts of communication towers and facilities; 
(c)  To consider the public health and safety effects of communication towers; 
(d)  To ensure that communication towers and telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses; 
(e)  To minimize adverse visual impacts of communication towers through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(f)  To accommodate the growing need for communication towers; 
(g)  To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new communication towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
(h)  To encourage the location of communication towers in non-residential areas and to enhance the installation of camouflage or stealth communications towers; 
(i)  To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from communication tower failure through engineering and careful siting of communication tower structures. 
(j)  To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for the erection of new communication towers to support antennas and telecommunications facilities; 
(k)  To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunication services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98)

An example of a camouflaged or stealth antenna would be an antenna with a color and appearance similar to a wall of a building or structure on which it is to be affixed, or an antenna located inside or on top of an existing structure such as an existing church steeple or an existing light pole. 
(6)  Co-location: The ability and right of two (2) or more different service providers (carriers) to place communication antennas on one communication tower. 
(7)  Communication tower means a building mounted or ground mounted tower which supports communication (transmission or receiving) equipment for telephone, radio, television, microwave, cellular and similar communications purposes. The term communication tower shall mean monopole or camouflaged towers only. The term includes radio and television towers, cellular telephone towers, camouflaged or stealth communication towers. The term includes the structure and any support thereto. The term communication tower shall not include amateur radio operators' equipment, licensed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

    For the purposes of measurement, communication tower setbacks as listed in section 17.5-6 and separation distances as listed in this section shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in the City of Maitland irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries. 
(1)  Communication tower separation shall be measured from the base of the existing or approved communication tower to the nearest property line of off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in the table set forth below. 
(2)  Communication tower separation from off-site uses/designated areas: Separation of towers from adjacent property shall comply with the following: 
Minimum Separation Distances From Adjacent Uses 
Adjacent Off-Site Uses Separation Distance Communication Towers: 

Property assigned a single-family (includes modular and mobile homes used for living purposes), duplex, or multi-family residential zoning classification or future land use designation as follows: 

(RS-1, RS-1A, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4, RS-D, RG-1, RG-2, RG-3, CC, PD (residential)) 

-or- 


Property assigned a non-residential PD zoning classification or future land use designation located in the Maitland Boulevard Corridor east of 1-4, west of Maitland Avenue and north of Sandspur Road. 300 feet or a distance equal to 300% of the height of the proposed communication tower, whichever is greater, except when a permitted conditional use is granted based upon findings that; either the aesthetic impact of the communication tower is enhanced; or the communication tower is constructed as a camouflage communication tower; that compatibility with abutting property owners is maintained, and the approval of the communication tower would be consistent with and further the provisions of section 17.5. Property assigned a non-residential zoning classification or future land use designation or property with an existing non-residential use. Determined by district setbacks (except property with non-residential uses located in residential zoning districts RS-1, RS-1A, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4, RS-D, RG-1, RG-2, RG-3, CC, PD (residential), property assigned a non-residential PD zoning classification or nonresidential future land use designation located in the Maitland Boulevard Corridor, east of I-4, west of Maitland Avenue and north of Sandspur Road which will be subject to separation distances listed above).  
(3)  Proposed communication towers must meet the following minimum separation requirements from existing communication towers or communication towers that have received City of Maitland land use or building permit approval prior to adoption of this chapter; provided, however, that the Maitland City Council, after receiving recommendations from the planning and zoning commission may reduce the required separation distances between towers by up to ten (10) percent if the applicant demonstrates good cause for such reduction in distancing requirements between communication towers. Any request to reduce the minimum separation requirements shall be pursuant to the Permitted Conditional Use Process as provided by section 17.5-11 of this chapter. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing communication tower and the base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed communication tower. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, a demonstration by the applicant that no other suitable and available sites exist for the construction of communication towers within the applicant's search ring, and that the applicant is unable to locate its proposed antennae on suitable and available existing structures within the applicant's search ring on commercially reasonable terms. In demonstrating good cause, the applicant has the burden to identify any adverse impact on adjoining properties which will occur as a result of the proposed reduction in distancing requirements between communication towers, and must propose conditions or steps that will mitigate any adverse impacts on such adjoining properties. 
The separation distances between communication towers (listed in linear feet) shall be as follows: 
Proposed Communication Tower Monopole Less than 80 ft. Monopole 80 ft. or Greater Monopole less than 80 ft.

(b)  The communication antenna complies with all applicable building codes and is issued a building permit. 
(c)  Antenna installed on a communication tower shall not horizontally extend more than fifteen (15) feet from the tower pole. 
(2)  Co-location of communication antenna. To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of communication towers, co-location of communication antenna by more than one (1) carrier on existing or new communication towers, or existing qualifying buildings and structures shall take precedence over the construction of new single-use communication towers as follows: 
(a)  Proposed communication antenna may, and are encouraged to, co-locate onto existing communication towers, buildings, and structures. Provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with section 17.5-5 and 17.5-6 for communication towers, and for section 17.5-6 for buildings and structures, then such co-locations are permitted by right and new or additional permitted conditional use approval or site plan approval shall not be required. 
(b)  Type of construction: A communication tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of an additional communication antenna shall be the same communication tower type as the existing communication tower or as a standard monopole tower. 
(c)  Height. 
1.  An existing communication tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed twenty (20) feet over the communication tower's original height for each co-location opportunity, or the maximum height allowed for each district, to accommodate the co-location of an additional communication antenna. 
2.  The height change referred to in section 17.5-6(3) shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in either section 17.5-5 or section 17.5-6. 
(d)  Onsite location. 
1.  A communication tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of an additional communication antenna may be moved onsite within fifty (50) feet of its existing location, however the antenna shall meet the requirements in this chapter. After the communication tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location, only one (1) communication tower may remain on the site. 
2.  A relocated onsite communication tower shall continue to be measured from the original communication tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between communication towers pursuant to section 17.5-5. The relocation of a communication tower in accordance with this subsection shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of section 17.5-5.

(c)  In granting a permitted conditional use permit the city council may impose conditions to the extent the city council concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed communication tower on adjoining properties. 
(d)  To the extent required by applicable law, any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
(e)  An applicant for a permitted conditional use permit shall submit the information described in this section and a non-refundable fee as established by the city council. 
(f)  Every permitted conditional use permit for a communication tower which is eighty (80) feet in height or taller and which is issued after the effective date of this chapter shall automatically expire five (5) years after the date of approval of the permitted conditional use permit, unless a copy of a co-location lease recorded in the public records of Orange County, or some similar document deemed sufficient by the city, is delivered to the city prior to that date. The co-location lease shall indicate that one or more other service providers have entered into an agreement with the communication tower owner and the other service provider(s) have the right to co-locate their antennas on the communication tower. 
1.  If the communication tower applicant provides a recorded co-location lease as part of its application, the five (5) year expiration condition shall not be a part of the permitted conditional use permit conditions of approval. An unrecorded copy of the co-location lease may be submitted to the city; provided, however, that no building permit shall be issued for such communication tower until the co-location lease is recorded in the public records of Orange County and a recorded copy if presented to the city. 
2.  Upon the passage of five (5) years without this condition being fulfilled, the permitted conditional use permit shall terminate and the communication tower removed at the applicant's expense. Notwithstanding any other remedies available at law or in equity, the city may seek an injunction to have the communication tower removed. 
3.  A communication tower permitted conditional use permit holder may seek to continue the permitted conditional use permit beyond five (5) years without a recorded co-location lease evidencing co-location by filing an application for a new permitted conditional use permit not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the current conditional use permit. This application shall be limited to supplying evidence as to the reasons co-location at the site has not been achievable. Provided the conditional use permit holder is able to document that a continuous, good faith, proactive effort has been made to secure a co-located service provider before, during and after the communication tower is constructed, the city shall grant a reasonable extension. 
(g)  No new communication tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing communication tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of communication towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city council related to the availability of suitable existing communication towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing communication tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
1.  No existing communication towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
2.  Existing communication towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
3.  Existing communication towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
5.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing communication tower or structure or to adapt an existing communication tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new communication tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
6.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing communication towers and structures unsuitable. 
7.  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of communication towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new communication tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(h)  If the applicant as part of the permitted conditional use process demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the application of the type of communication tower, height, location or distance requirements in this chapter effectively prohibits the establishment of a personal wireless service or other communication service network, then the type of communications tower, location, height or distance requirements can be modified by the city council after receiving recommendations from the planning and zoning commission. The applicant has the burden to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the installation of a monopole, as opposed to latticed or guyed pole, will effectively prohibit the establishment of a personal wireless or other communication services network. If necessary to protect residential areas and other land uses from the potential adverse impacts of communication towers and to minimize adverse visual impacts of such communication towers, the city council has the discretion to require additional alternative design, siting, landscape, screening and innovative camouflaging techniques as part of the approval process. 
(i)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the Maitland City Council, after receiving recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may reduce the required separation distances between communication towers by up to ten (10) percent if the applicant demonstrates good cause for such reduction between communication towers. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98; Ord. No. 991, § 3, 1-24-00; Ord. No. 1335, § 1(Exh. A), 8-27-18 )

(2)  Drawing(s) showing elevation of the proposed communication tower, indicating the finished color and, if applicable, the method of camouflage and illumination. 
(3)  Site plans, including landscape, fencing and accessory structure drawings, or other information showing compliance with the performance standards outlined in section 17.5-6. However, where applicant requests approval of a camouflaged or stealth communication tower, applicant may request a waiver pursuant to section 17.5-10 (1)(b). Compliance may be waived by the planning and zoning commission for camouflaged communication tower applicants upon submission by applicant of facts and information including proposed landscaping, fencing and accessory structure drawings demonstrating that a waiver or modification of the provisions by the planning and zoning commission is necessary to achieve conformity with existing structures and uses consistent with the intent of this chapter. 
(4)  Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if applicable). 
(5)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or communication tower shall provide to the city an inventory of its existing communication towers, antennas, or sites approved for communication towers or antennas that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one (1) mile of the border thereof including specific information about the location, height and design of each communication tower. The city manager or designee may share such information with other applicants applying for site plan reviews under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however that the city manager or designee is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(6)  A statement by the applicant as to how construction of the communication tower will accommodate co-location of additional antenna for future users. 
(7)  Balloon test shall not be required except where application is made for waiver of height, separation or type of communication tower pursuant to section 17.5-10(h). The purpose of this test is to assist the planning and zoning commission in determining aesthetic impact with respect to height and closeness of a communication tower in proximity to nearby residential uses and zoning. The following criteria shall be met: 
(a)  Balloon specifications: 
1.  Balloon diameter no less than four (4) feet; 
2.  Balloon color restricted to red, orange, or yellow; 
3.  Balloon is anchored to the ground;

The annual inspections shall include a written report, sealed by the engineer or architect, and filed with the City of Maitland prior to May 1st of each year. If communication tower construction is completed within six (6) months of May 1st, then a report does not have to be submitted for that year. The report shall include documentation by the engineer or a letter from the Federal Communications Commission acknowledging that the antenna operates at the approved FCC transmission levels. 
(1)  The city or its agents shall have authority to enter onto the property upon which a communication tower is located, between the inspections and certifications required above, to inspect the communication tower for the purpose of determining whether it complies with all applicable laws and regulations. 
(2)  The city reserves the right to conduct such inspections at any time, upon reasonable notice to the communication tower owner or operator. All expenses related to such inspections by the city shall be borne by the communication tower owner or operator. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98) 
Sec. 17.5-14. - Maintenance. 
(1)  Communication tower owners shall at all times employ ordinary and reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use nothing less than commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public. 
(2)  All communication towers, accessory buildings or structures and antenna support structures shall at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair so that the same shall not menace or endanger the life or property of any person.

(4)  All communication towers shall maintain compliance with current radio frequency emission standards of the FCC or any superseding city, state and county regulations. 
(5)  In the event the use of a communication tower is discontinued by the communication tower owner, the communication tower owner shall provide written notice to the city of its intent to discontinue use and the date when the use will be discontinued. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98) 
Sec. 17.5-15. - Building codes and safety standards. 
    To insure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a communication tower shall insure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a communication tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the communication tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days (or such shorter time as may be reasonably required by the city in an emergency situation) to bring such communication tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such communication tower into compliance within the required time period shall constitute grounds for the removal of the communication tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Further, any improvements and/or additions (i.e. antenna, satellite dishes, etc.) to existing communication towers shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards in effect at the time of such improvement or addition. Such plans shall be submitted to and reviewed and approved by a city manager or designee at the time building permits are requested. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98) 
Sec. 17.5-16. - State or federal requirements. 
    All communication towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communication towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the communication towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such communication towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring communication towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the communication tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98) 
ARTICLE VII. - ABANDONMENT AND MODIFICATION 

Sec. 17.5-17. - Abandonment. 
    In the event the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, the communication tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city manager or designee who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the communication tower owner/operator regarding the issue of communication tower usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the communication tower shall have an additional one hundred eighty (180) days within which to: (1) reactivate the use of the communication tower or transfer the communication tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the communication tower, or (2) dismantle and remove the communication tower. Any site plan or permitted conditional use approval for the communication tower shall automatically expire one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, whichever is first. 
(Ord. No. 942, § 1, 3-9-98) 
Sec. 17.5-18. - Modification of communication towers. 
    A communication tower which was in compliance with zoning regulations applicable at the time the communication tower was established and for which all required permits were issued, may continue in existence as a nonconforming structure. 
(1)  Expansion of nonconforming use. Communication towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(2)  Preexisting communication towers. Preexisting communication towers shall be allowed to continued their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement with a new communication tower of like construction and height) shall be permitted on such preexisting communication towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on a preexisting communication tower shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Rebuilding damaged or destroyed conforming communication towers or antennas. Bona fide nonconforming communication towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt without having to first obtain administrative approval or a permitted conditional use permit and without having to meet the separation requirements specified in section 17.5-4. The type, height, and location of the communication tower onsite shall be of the same type as the original facility approval. The rebuilt facility shall comply with the then applicable building codes and the required building permits shall be obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the facility is damaged or destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if said permit expires, the communication tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified in section 17.5-17.

ARTICLE VIII. - USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY BY COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Secs. 17.5-31-17.5-40. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 17.5-41. - Title. 
    This division shall be known and may be cited as the City of Maitland, Florida Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1012, § 1, 6-25-01) 
Sec. 17.5-42. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: Providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way within the City of Maitland, adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with State and Federal law, including Section 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended, the City's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Ord. No. 1012, § 2, 6-25-01) 
Sec. 17.5-43. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this division, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
(1)  Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
(2)  City shall mean City of Maitland, Florida. 
(3)  Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this division "cable service", as defined in Section 202.11(2), Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "Communications Services," and cable service providers may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
(4)  Communications services provider shall mean any person including a municipality or county providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person including a municipality or county that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
(5)  Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the City of Maitland, Florida and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
(6)  Division shall mean this division [section 17-41 et seq.]. 
(7)  FCC shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
(8)  In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way shall mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
(9)  Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the City of Maitland to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
(10)  Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or "placing or maintaining" shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(11)  Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, tunnel or alley for which the City of Maitland is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. 
(12)  Registrant shall mean a communications services provider that has registered with the City of Maitland in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(13)  Registration or register shall mean the process described in this division whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1012, § 3, 6-25-01) 
Sec. 17.5-44. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the City of Maitland shall first register with the city in accordance with this division. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this division, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this division governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this division. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the City of Maitland shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this division and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this division, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
(5)  The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any. 
(d)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the public works director or his or her designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the City of Maitland stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the City of Maitland but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this division and further subject to any additional City of Maitland ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the City of Maitland by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this division, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3), a registrant shall provide updated information to the City of Maitland. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this division. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable City of Maitland ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Ord. No. 1012, § 4, 6-25-01) 
Sec. 17.5-45. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this division. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the City of Maitland within twenty (20) days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 17.5-4 within sixty (60) days of the transfer, sale or assignment. 
    If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the public works director that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(Ord. No. 1012, § 5, 6-25-01) 
Sec. 17.5-46. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and City of Maitland ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits have been issued by the City of Maitland or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(c)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(1)  The location of the proposed facilities, including a description of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods or techniques); 
(3)  A maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the public rights-of-way; 
(4)  Information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility, if available; 
(5)  If appropriate given the facility proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the public rights-of-way; 
(6)  The timetable for construction of the project or each phase thereof, and the areas of the City of Maitland which will be affected; 
(7)  Plans sealed by a registered Florida professional engineer or an engineer who is a regular full-time employee of the company for underground installation of fiber optic or other cable and associated equipment to be used by registrant; 
(8)  Video tape of area affected (including and not limited to curbs, right-of-way foliage, sidewalks, etc.) at the time of the right-of-way permit application with the tape appropriately marked as to registrant, date, permittee and such other pertinent information as may be requested by the city; and 
(9)  Such additional information as the city finds reasonably necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application to review such permit application. 
(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the City of Maitland shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(e)  The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. To the extent permitted by law, the city shall require all facilities or systems, including but not limited to, fiber optic or other cable, pipes, and other pathways, to be installed underground, as long as all other similarly situated utilities are also so required. Aboveground installation shall be limited to those parts of facilities or systems that must be mounted on the surface. No facility or cable or other pathways shall be mounted on poles or towers. The public works director may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this division and other applicable law. Registrants shall also conform to all the requirements of the Maitland City Code pertaining to the regulation of the use of right-of-way, as such may be amended from time to time. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(1)  Registrant shall take all precautions to prevent the creation of any obstructions or conditions, which are or may become dangerous to the traveling public at all times. If, in the opinion of the city, registrant creates an obstruction or condition which may become dangerous to the traveling public, the city will correct such dangerous condition and registrant shall reimburse city for any and all reasonable costs associated therewith. 
(2)  Registrant shall place its cable within said right-of-way in such a manner so as to avoid any damage or injury to the roadway or other structure within said right-of-way. If actions by the registrant result in damage to said roadway or right-of-way, registrant shall promptly restore the roadway and right-of-way within two (2) weeks to a condition which, in the opinion of city, is at least equal to that which existed immediately prior to the infliction of such damage by registrant. In the event the registrant shall fail to restore the right-of-way to its original condition within two (2) weeks as required herein, then city, at its option, may restore the right-of-way to its original condition by utilizing sums from the registrant's construction bond or security fund, as required in this division. 
(g)  Within thirty (30) days of permit approval, registrants shall submit any amended signed and sealed plans to the public works director who shall approve same prior to registrants commencing any construction. 
(h)  Registrants shall provide the public works director with as-built plans no later than sixty (60) days following completion of all construction work in City of Maitland rights-of-way. 
(i)  Registrants shall maintain, keep, and submit to the city at all times an accurate set of drawings and plans, with horizontal and vertical controls, which shall show the location of such fiber optic and other cable within the rights-of-way. At the request of the city, identification markers satisfactory to the city shall be placed in said right-of-way by registrants showing the location of said cable, which shall be limited to a defined area within the right-of-way. The drawings and plans shall be in a hard copy format and/or an electronic format if specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. The city recognizes that Section 202.195, Florida Statutes (2000) provides that specified proprietary confidential business information obtained from a telecommunications company or franchised cable company by a local governmental entity is exempt from the Florida Public Records Law. 
(j)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the City of Maitland may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with Section 337.402, Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended. For twelve (12) months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this division at its own expense. 
(k)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the City of Maitland of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 337.403 and 337.404, Florida Statutes (2000), as they may be amended. 
(l)  A permit from the City of Maitland constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this division, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(m)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(n)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in Chapter 556, Florida Statutes (2000), as it may be amended. 
(o)  Upon request of the City of Maitland, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(p)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the City of Maitland, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(q)  The city shall not be liable to registrant or its customers for any interruption to service of registrant or its customers or for interference with the operation of said cable of registrant arising in any manner out of the use of said right-of-way by registrant, the city or any other person or party, except that city is subject to the provisions of subsection 17.5-46(w) herein and section 17.5-52 of this division. 
(r)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the City of Maitland or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(s)  The City of Maitland makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the city's public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this division shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(t)  The City of Maitland shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this division. 
(u)  The City of Maitland reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(v)  Each telecommunication provider authorized to construct backbone facilities in the public rights-of-way shall construct those facilities so that they are capable of accommodating additional telecommunication facilities owned by other persons or entities. Lateral connections into specific locations are not included in this requirement. Each telecommunications provider authorized to construct facilities in the public rights-of-way shall permit, to the greatest extent possible, utilization of their conduit, poles, trenches and other facilities by cable television and telecommunication providers, or shall co-locate its facilities on existing facilities or others. To the extent such use shall be subject to requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 regarding use of utilities including electric, gas and telephone rights-of-way conduit and facilities for cable television telecommunications purposes, rates and charges shall be consistent with the general objectives and requirements outlined in that Act. 
Any telecommunications provider whose facilities contain additional capacity for installation or co-location of telecommunications facilities owned by other persons shall agree to allow other persons to install or co-locate their telecommunications facilities on such facilities subject to reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions negotiated between the parties. All costs of co-locating or installing additional telecommunications facilities shall be borne by the person seeking to do so. 
(w)  The city shall not be liable for any claims against the City of Maitland for damages arising from any negligent or unintentional breach of the underground conduit or fiber optic cable system, provided that prior to any construction or excavation project undertaken by the city or any of its contractors, the city, or its representative, on each such occasion shall contact registrant via a telephone call to Sunshine State One Call of Florida at 1-800-432-4770. In the event such call is not made and damage to the conduit or fiber or both occurs, the city's liability shall be limited to the cost of repair to the conduit and fiber and shall explicitly exclude any consequential business damages. To the extent permitted by law, the city may be responsible for damages arising from any act or omission, or breach of the underground conduit or fiber, constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct by the city, or its employees, or any of its contractors, agents or representatives.

(c)  The fees imposed pursuant to this division are a fee and not a tax as specified in Section 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000); consequently,

Included within the fee are all taxes, licenses, fees, in-kind contributions accepted pursuant to Section 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000), and other impositions except ad valorem taxes and amounts for assessments for special benefits, such as sidewalks, street pavings, and similar improvements, and occupational license taxes levied or imposed by the city upon the telecommunications company. 
(2)  In the event that a telecommunications company which provides telecommunications services defined as toll services in Section 203.012(7), Florida Statutes (2000), occupies the city's rights-of-way, the telecommunications company shall pay to the city annually five hundred dollars ($500.00) per linear mile, which amount is prorated for any portion thereof, for any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway that makes physical use of the city's rights-of-way. Such annual fee shall be prorated to reflect the expiration date of this division and shall be payable annually, in advance. If a telecommunications company that is required to pay a fee pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(2) increases the amount of its facilities occupying the city's rights-of-way after such advance payment has been made, but prior to the expiration date of this division, the fees due for the additional facilities shall be prorated and paid in full at the time the facilities are installed in the city's rights-of-way. 
The fee or other consideration imposed pursuant to this subsection (2) shall not apply in any manner to any telecommunications company which provides local telephone service as defined in Section 203.012(3), Florida Statutes (2000), for any services provided by such telecommunications company.

The installment payments shall be based upon such gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for the immediately preceding installment period or portion thereof after the effective date of this division, and shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days following the end of the period. Past due payments or underpayments shall bear interest accrued from the last day of the quarter for which the payment was due. Interest shall be paid at the Florida statutory rate of interest on judgments as established by Section 55.03, Florida Statutes (2000). Payments shall include a statement as to how the fee amount was determined and the statement shall be certified by the telecommunications company's chief financial officer or other duly authorized representative of the company. 
(c)  If the city wishes to verify the payments due to the city under this section, the telecommunications company shall permit the city or a designated representative of the city, upon reasonable advance written notice, and during normal business hours at the location of the telecommunications company where such records are maintained in the city, at another location satisfactory to the city, or elsewhere pursuant to (1) or (2) below, to review or audit the telecommunications company's billing and payment records kept in the ordinary course of business upon which the payments were based. If a telecommunications company's records are not maintained in the city, the telecommunications company shall either: 
(1)  Pay all reasonable expenses, including travel, following the provisions of subsections 112.061 (6), (7) and (8), Florida Statutes (2000), to the city for the city to have a review or audit performed; or

However, without the specific written consent of a telecommunications company's audit representative, no company records may be duplicated or taken from the telecommunications company's premises, and the city shall maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed in these records and use the information solely for the purposes of verifying payments by the telecommunications company. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for sums due and payable under this division unless the city agrees in writing. In the event that the city, pursuant to final audit findings, determines that there exists a difference between the amount due to the city and the amount paid to the city, indicating an underpayment to the city, in excess of five (5) percent of the amount due, such telecommunications company shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the audit. 
(d)  This division is adopted consistent with the provisions of Section 337.401, Florida Statutes (2000), and other applicable provisions of law. This section shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of the power of the city to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules and regulations pursuant to applicable provisions of law. 
(e)  If required by applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a telecommunications company shall be registered with the city and obtain all permits that may be required by the city regarding occupation of the city's public rights-of-way for telecommunications facilities.

(Code 1971, § 20-22) 
Sec. 20-36. - Approval of septic tanks. 
    No septic tank other than those approved by the State Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services shall be constructed within the city.

Sec. 20-38. - When sewer connections required; time within which connections to be made. 
    The owner of a properly functioning on-site sewage treatment and disposal system must connect the system or the building's plumbing to the city's sewerage system within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after written notification by the city that the system is available for connection. The city must notify the owner of the availability of the central sewerage system. Not less than one (1) year prior to the date the sewerage system will become available, the city shall notify the affected owner of the anticipated availability of the sewerage system and shall also notify the owner that the owner will be required to connect to the sewerage system within one (1) year of the actual availability. All such connections shall be made in accordance with rules and regulations which shall be adopted from time to time by the city council, which rules and regulations may provide for a charge for making any such connections in such reasonable amount as the council may fix and determine. Provided, however, that no connection or connections shall be required where said sewer system or line is more than two hundred (200) feet from such lot or parcel of land; and provided further, that no person shall be required to cross the private property of another to make such sewer connections.

(Code 1971, § 20-26) 
Sec. 20-40. - Connection by city on failure of owner. 
    If any owner of any lot or parcel of land within the city shall fail and refuse to connect with and use the facilities of the sewer system of the city after notification, as provided in section 20-38 hereof, then the city shall be authorized to make such connections, entering on or upon any such lot or parcel of land for the purpose of making such connection. The city shall thereupon be entitled to recover the cost of making such connection, together with reasonable penalties and interest and attorney's fees, by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition and as an alternative means of collecting such costs of making such connections, the city shall have a lien on such lot or parcel of land for such cost, which lien shall be an equal dignity with the lien for state, county and municipal taxes.

(Ord. No. 1168, § 3, 8-25-08) 
Sec. 20-134. - Operating budget. 
    The city shall adopt an operating budget for the stormwater environmental utility not later than the first day of each fiscal year. The operating budget shall set forth for such fiscal year the estimated collectible revenues of the utility and the estimated costs for planning, administration, construction and capital improvements, operations and maintenance, extension and replacement, and debt service. 
(Ord. No. 1168, § 4, 8-25-08) 
Sec. 20-135. - Stormwater fee. 
(a)  Fee established. A stormwater fee is hereby imposed on each and every developed parcel, other than exempt property, payable as provided in subsection 20-135(d). The stormwater fee shall be a monthly or annual service charge, the frequency being determined by the provisions of subsection 20-135(d). 
(b)  Computation. On or before September 15 of each year, the city council shall by resolution establish the stormwater fee for one ERU for the ensuing fiscal year. The stormwater fee shall be not more than the amount determined by dividing the budgeted cost for the city's stormwater environmental utility services for planning, administration, construction, capital improvements, operations and maintenance, extension and replacement, and debt service, by the sum of the ERU values of all developed parcels within the city. The fee for each parcel shall be determined by multiplying the stormwater fee for one ERU by the ERU value of the parcel and multiplying the product by the mitigation credit factor: 
Fee for 1 ERU × ERU Value × Mitigation Credit Factor 
The city council may fund less than all of the proposed operating budget for the stormwater environmental utility with stormwater fees, by appropriating funds from any other lawful source. 
(c)  Stormwater fee roll. Within ten (10) days after adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, and thereafter on or before August 1 of each year, the city manager or designee shall prepare a stormwater fee roll containing each tax parcel subject to a stormwater fee, and the ERU value (calculated in the manner provided in section 20-136) and mitigation credit factor assigned to that parcel as of the preceding January 1. Where a developed parcel has multiple assigned utility accounts, the roll shall subdivide the developed parcel by account; and 
(1)  Shall apportion the ERU value of the parcel among the utility accounts by assigning to each account the impervious area attributable to the improvements exclusively served by that account; and 
(2)  Shall apportion any remaining impervious area such as parking lot or driveway which serves two (2) or more accounts, between or among such accounts by the proportion of their respective amounts of exclusively occupied impervious area. A copy of the stormwater fee roll and of the current and any proposed resolutions of the city council establishing the ERU rate and mitigation credit factors shall be maintained on file in the office of the city manager or designee as a public record. 
(d)  Method of collection. 
(1)  The finance department shall bill the stormwater fee for those developed parcels utilizing other city utilities to the utility account holder on a monthly basis, as a separate item on the city's bill for all other city utilities. 
(2)  The finance department shall bill the stormwater fee for multiple utility accounts within a single developed parcel monthly to each utility account holder, on a prorated basis in accordance with subsection 20-135(c) and as a separate item on the city's bill for all other city utilities. 
(3)  The finance department shall bill the stormwater fee for those developed parcels having no other utility accounts no less often than annually, as directed by the city manager or designee. 
(4)  The stormwater fee for those properties utilizing other city utilities is part of a consolidated statement for utility customers payable by a single payment. In the event that a partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied pro-rata to each utility service billed on the consolidated statement, in the proportion that an individual utility service bears to the total consolidated statement of all current charges for all utility services, unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
(5)  All bills for stormwater fees shall become due and payable in accordance with the city's rules and regulations of the finance department pertaining to the collection of the fees. 
(6)  The city shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in collecting delinquent stormwater fees. Any charge due hereunder which is not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the city. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the city or general law, failure of any user of city utilities within the city to pay said charges promptly when due shall subject such user to possible discontinuance of other utility services and the city manager or designee, is hereby empowered and directed to enforce this provision as to any and all delinquent users. 
(e)  Appeal of calculation of stormwater fees. Any owner of a developed parcel which is subject to payment of a stormwater utility fee who contests the calculation of the stormwater fee for that parcel as shown in the stormwater fee roll, may appeal such determination to the city manager or designee. Any appeal must be filed in writing not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the first utility billing of the fiscal year, and may include a survey prepared by a registered surveyor showing dwelling unit(s), total property area, impervious area or non-residential developed area and any such other information that the appellant may deem appropriate. The city manager or designee may request additional information from the appealing party. Based upon the information provided by the utility and appealing party, the city manager or designee shall make a final calculation of the applicable stormwater fee. The city manager or designee shall notify the parties, in writing, of the decision within sixty (60) days of submittal. Any decision of the city manager or designee may be further appealed to the city council by filing written notice with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the city manager's decision. The decision of the city council shall be final. Upon finality, the city manager or designee shall make any necessary reductions to the stormwater fee roll in respect of the affected parcel or parcels, and shall make any appropriate refunds of fees already paid in the current fiscal year. 
(Ord. No. 1168, § 5, 8-25-08) 
Sec. 20-136. - Determination of ERU values. 
(a)  Classification of developed parcels. Each developed parcel located within the stormwater service area shall be classified on the stormwater fee roll as a single-family parcel, residential condominium parcel or general parcel. 
(b)  Small single family parcels. The council hereby finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  Small single family residence parcels constitute a significant proportion of all parcels located with the stormwater service area, and the cost of measuring or verifying the impervious area for each individual small single family residence greatly exceeds any benefit to be derived from individual measurement or verification. 
(2)  The ERU value of all small single family residence parcels is on average seventy (70) percent of that of a medium single family residence parcel, and accordingly all small single family residence parcels are assigned an ERU value of 0.7. 
(c)  Medium single family parcels. The council hereby finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  Medium single family residence parcels constitute a significant proportion of all parcels located with the stormwater service area and represent the most typical size, single-family residence within the stormwater service area. The cost of measuring or verifying the impervious area for each individual medium single family residence greatly exceeds any benefit to be derived from individual measurement or verification. 
(2)  All medium single family residence parcels are assigned an ERU value of 1.0. 
(d)  Large single family parcels. The council hereby finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  Large single family residence parcels constitute a significant proportion of all parcels located with the stormwater service area. The cost of measuring or verifying the impervious area for each individual large single family residence greatly exceeds any benefit to be derived from individual measurement or verification. 
(2)  The ERU value of all large single family residence parcels is on average one hundred forty (140) percent of that of a medium single family residence parcel, and accordingly all large single family residence parcels are assigned an ERU value of 1.4. 
(e)  Residential condominium parcels. The council hereby finds and determines as follows: 
(1)  A residential condominium is part of an identifiable class of real property ownership comprised of condominium residential unit parcels, to which there may be an appurtenant undivided share in condominium common area parcels. When the allocable share of common area of residential condominium parcels is considered, the average impervious area for each condominium unit is found to be within the range of such areas for small single family residence parcels and is assigned an ERU value of 0.7. 
(2)  The classification of any new or modified condominium as small single family residential is subject to redetermination by the city manager or designee, subject to the right of the condominium association to appeal to the council in the manner provided in subsection 20-135(e). If, as a result of such a redetermination the actual impervious area of such new or modified residential condominium, prorated among the units of the condominium, is found to be more than one hundred (100) percent of an ERU (2,532 square feet), then the condominium units shall be assigned an ERU value of 1.0, effective as of January 1 of the year following such redetermination. 
(3)  In determining the mitigation credit factor for residential condominium parcels, any part of the impervious area of the condominium that is directly connected to the city's stormwater management system without onsite detention shall be subject to the stormwater utility fee without credit for mitigation. 
(f)  General parcels. The ERU value of each general parcel shall be determined by (1) dividing the impervious area of the general parcel by one ERU (2,532 square feet), and (2) multiplying the result by the appropriate mitigation credit factor. In determining the mitigation credit factor for general parcels, any part of the impervious area of the parcel that is directly connected to the city's stormwater management system without onsite detention shall be subject to the stormwater utility fee without credit for mitigation. 
(g)  Mitigation credit policy for private stormwater management facilities. 
(1)  The council recognizes the benefits provided by privately maintained stormwater management facilities. Developed parcels which provide private stormwater management facilities should be credited to the extent that such facilities advance the goals and objectives established from time to time in the stormwater/lakes management plan and the city's comprehensive plan. The council hereby approves the initial mitigation credit policy attached as Appendix A. The policy may be modified by resolution of the city council at any time to conform to revisions in such goals and objectives; provided, that such modification shall not apply retroactively to credits previously established under a pre-existing credit policy. 
(2)  In order to receive a mitigation credit for which a developed parcel is eligible, the property owner or user shall provide the city manager or designee with supporting documentation. Such documentation may include "as built" drawings (unless they have been previously provided) of the stormwater management facility sealed by a Florida-registered professional engineer, a certification from a Florida-registered professional engineer as to the standards of retention and detention achieved by the facility, an operating permit for the stormwater management facility from the appropriate regional water management district, or such other reasonable requirements as may be necessary to demonstrate the relief of city stormwater facilities or advancement of the goals and objectives of the stormwater/lakes management plan and the city's comprehensive plan. 
(3)  No mitigation credit shall be applied to the stormwater fee for service provided to a developed parcel by a stormwater management facility constructed or maintained with public funds. Nevertheless, a mitigation credit shall be available for stormwater utility service provided to a developed parcel by an approved and permitted regional stormwater management facility, if and to the extent that the utility's costs of capital construction or debt amortization are reduced because the developer of the property provided a capital contribution to the regional facility in lieu of constructing on-site facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1168, § 6, 8-25-08) 
Sec. 20-137. - Program responsibility. 
    The city manager or designee shall administer the stormwater environmental utility system created by this ordinance. The city manager or designee shall keep an accurate record of all persons using the services and facilities of said stormwater management system of the city and make changes in accordance with the rates and charges established in this article. 
(Ord. No. 1168, § 7, 8-25-08) 
Sec. 20-138. - Stormwater environmental utility fund. 
(a)  Special revenue fund. A stormwater management fund is established, into which all revenues from user fees, connection charges, grants or other funding sources of the stormwater environmental utility shall be deposited and from which all planning, construction, operation, education, administration and maintenance expenditures related to the city's stormwater management utility shall be paid. Accounting and reporting procedures shall be consistent with state law and reported to the city council by the city manager at least annually. It is the intent of the City Council that this fund be established as a special revenue fund, rather than an enterprise fund. 
(b)  Limitation on expenditures. Expenditures for activities that are not related to the city's stormwater environmental utility shall not be permitted from the fund, except for a prorated charge for general city government services as is in effect for other city utility funds.

(I)  Administration. An administrative official hereby known as the zoning administrator shall administer, enforce, and interpret the zoning code. In the performance of these duties, the zoning administrator may request the assistance of authorized officers within the city and is thereby authorized to act through aides or assistants. 
    A violation or alleged violation of the zoning code may be filed by any person(s). The complaint signed by the complainant may be submitted in writing to the zoning administrator or designee. If the complaint is not transmitted in writing and signed by the complainant, the alleged violation shall be investigated and validated prior to initiation of enforcement procedures. All complaints received shall be recorded. 
    Upon verification of the legitimacy of the complaint, the zoning administrator shall forward a notice of zoning violation to the property owner of record as listed in the most current tax rolls from Orange County. It shall cite the section of the code which is allegedly violated and allow fifteen (15) days in which to comply with the code. The fifteen (15) days shall be measured from the date of receipt of the certified letter. 
    At the conclusion of the fifteen (15) days, a follow up report shall be forwarded to the code enforcement officer. It shall at a minimum contain the zoning administrator's interpretation of the code section violated, a copy of the section of the code allegedly violated, and any supplemental information which may assist in the disposition of the case. 
(II)  Penalties for violation. Violations of the provisions or failure to comply with any of the requirements therein (including violations of conditions of approval resultant from a decision rendered by an established board, commission or council) shall be subject to code enforcement proceedings and penalties set forth in Chapter 5.3, Code Enforcement, of the City Code. 
    The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, building contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates in, assists in or maintains such violation may individually be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer code enforcement proceedings and penalties set forth in Chapter 5.3. 
    Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
Cross reference- Code enforcement procedures, § 4.7-8 et seq. 
(III)  Building permits required. No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to or structurally altered without a permit consistent with requirements established herein and issued by the building official. Any permit issued in error shall not confer any rights or privileges on the applicant to proceed with construction, but the city shall have the right to revoke such permit. In cases where a permit has been issued in error, but where actual construction has begun according to the building official's application of the Florida Building Code, city council shall determine the appropriate course of action. 
(Ord. No. 763, § 1, 11-26-90; Ord. No. 1309, § 6, 6-26-16 ) 
Sec. 21-5. - Supplemental district regulations. 
(I)  Nonconforming lots; nonconforming uses of land; nonconforming structures; nonconforming uses of structures and premises; nonconforming characteristics of uses. 
(a)  Intent. Within the districts established by this zoning code or amendments that may later be adopted there may exist: (a) lots, (b) structures, (c) uses of land and structures, and (d) characteristics of use which were lawful before this zoning code was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this zoning code or future amendments. It is the intent of this zoning code to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this zoning code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
Nonconforming uses are declared by this zoning code to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code. However, if construction of the building(s), as determined by the Building Official's application of the Florida Building Code, has not begun within one (1) year following approval of a site plan or the building permit for construction of the building(s) has become void, any approval of the site plan and uses designated therein shall terminate. If the site plan lapses or building permit becomes void, resubmission of a site plan or building permit is required and is subject to all review and approval processes regardless of any previous site plan or permit approvals acquired. 
(b)  Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which dwellings are permitted, a dwelling or dwellings and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot that is of record as of May 22, 1967, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this zoning code. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard or other requirements not involving use shall be obtained only through action of the board of zoning adjustment. 
Such lot must have at least the same total square footage and lot width as originally platted. 
As applied to the RS-3 district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by this section and other provisions of this zoning code, should such lot be altered so that it no longer has at least the same total square footage and lot width as originally platted, a dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected, provided the lot was not altered after the effective date of the adoption of this Zoning Code, November 26, 1990, and such lot must not be less than forty-five (45) feet in width. 
As applied to the RS-D district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by this section and other provisions of this zoning code, should such lot be altered so that it no longer has at least the same total square footage and lot width as originally platted, a dwelling or two family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on such lot, provided the lot was not altered after the effective date of the adoption of this zoning code, November 26, 1990, and such lot must not be less than forty-eight (48) feet in width. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses of land. Where at the time of passage of this zoning code lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this zoning code, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code; 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code; 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this zoning code for the district in which such land is located. 
(4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this zoning code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(d)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code that could not be built under the terms of this code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; 
(2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the assessed value of the structure or nonconforming portion of the structure at time of destruction, the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this zoning code. 
(3)  Should such structure or portion of such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent less than fifty (50) percent of its assessed value, it may be restored only upon application to the board of zoning adjustment. 
(4)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(5)  Pre-existing fences made non-conforming due to annexation by the city shall be permitted to be repaired or replaced, in part or in whole, provided the repair or replacement does not increase the nonconformity with respect to height or setback, and subject to section 21-6(II) Visibility at Intersections. 
(e)  Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. If a lawful use of a structure and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this zoning code that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this zoning code, the lawful use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this zoning code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this zoning code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
(3)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
(4)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located; 
(5)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the assessed value of the structure at time of destruction. 
(f)  Repairs and maintenance, On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current assessed value of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack or repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the general regulations of the district in which it is located. 
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful for reasons other than lack of repairs or maintenance, nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of such building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety provided, however, that, where such unsafeness or unlawfulness is the result of damage from destruction, the percentage of damage limitations as set out in this section shall apply. 
Where a building or structure is conforming as to location and use, nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of such building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety. 
(g)  Uses under permitted conditional use provisions not nonconforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a permitted conditional use in a district under the terms of this zoning code shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district. 
(II)  Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any district, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision, which constitutes hazardous conditions for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, between a height of two and one-half (21/2') and ten feet (10') above the top of the curb of the intersection streets in the areas bounded by the street (right-of-way) lines of such corner lots and a line joining points along said street (right-of-way) lines twenty-five feet (25') from the point of the intersection on minor and collector streets, and fifty feet (50') on arterial streets. 
For Winfield Units 1 and 2 (Single Family Residential Subdivisions), annexed by Ordinance No. 970, no fence or wall shall be erected so as to encroach into the fifteen-foot (15') corner triangle at a street intersection. 
Cross reference- Traffic, Ch. 18. 
(III)  Fences and walls. On any residentially zoned district, fences, walls, and hedges erected or placed on all lots shall be in accordance with the following criteria. 
(a)  Fences and walls may be erected, placed, and maintained at a height not exceeding eight feet (8') above the established grade level in any required side or rear yard. Fences and walls within a required front yard shall not exceed two and one-half feet (21/2') in height above the established lot grade. (Ord. No. 855, § 1, 11-28-94) 
Except for pre-existing fences listed in section 21-5 (5), for Winfield Units 1 and 2 (Single Family Residential Subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance No. 970, fences and walls are limited to a maximum height of four feet (4') within a required front yard and a maximum height of eight feet (8') within any required side or rear yard. On any corner lot abutting the side of another lot, no part of any fence located within twenty-five feet (25') of the common lot line shall be nearer the side street lot line than the required front yard of such abutting lot unless adjacent property owner sharing the common lot line provides notarized letter of approval and there are no site visibility concerns. 
(b)  In residential zoning districts, notwithstanding other provisions in this zoning code, fences and walls, up to eight (8') feet in height may be erected, placed and maintained in any required yard for security of a public park in conjunction with Section 21-20. Floating Zone, Public/Semi-Public Uses of the zoning code. Nevertheless, within any required front yard, no solid fence or solid wall shall be located so as to constitute a hazardous obstruction of visibility, between two and one-half feet (21/2') and ten feet (10') in height, to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. (Ord. No. 855, § 2, 11-28-94) 
(c)  Barbed wire or electrically charged fences shall not be erected in any residential district. Neither shall any wall, fence or similar structure erected in any residential district contain any material or substance such as broken glass, spikes, nails, barbs or similar materials designed to inflict pain or injury on any person or animal. (Ord. No. 855, § 3, 11-28-94) 
(d)  In a residential zoning district on a "flag lot" construction of a fence or wall within the "access" portion of the lot is not permitted. The "access" portion of a "flag lot" is that part of the lot which serves to meet the minimum frontage requirement on a public or private street, but does not meet the minimum lot width requirements, and functions primarily as a driveway to reach the remainder of lot or parcel of land. (See diagram "Yards on cul-de-sac lots and flag lots," Section 21-23. Definitions.) Fence or wall construction on other than the "access" portion of the lot shall be in accordance with front, side and rear yard requirements for residential zoning districts as noted above. 
In commercial or office districts, notwithstanding other provisions in this zoning code, fences and walls up to eight feet (8') in height may be permitted in any required yard provided that no solid fence or solid wall within any required front yard shall constitute a hazardous obstruction of visibility, between two and one-half feet (21/2') and ten feet (10') in height, to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
Likewise, in any nonresidential districts, barbed wire may be incorporated in or used as a fence above the level of six feet (6') from the ground. Any barbed wire shall be placed so that it does not project outward over any street, sidewalk, public way, or adjacent property. 
Finally, in any district, hedges may be placed, planted or allowed to grow so as to form an opaque screen within any required front yard or within the access portion of a flag lot, but shall not be permitted so as to constitute a hazardous obstruction of visibility, between two and one-half feet (21/2') and ten feet (10') in height, to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. (Ord. No. 855, § 4, 11-28-94) 
(IV)  Parking of commercial vehicles within residential districts. The parking of any vehicle greater than one (1) ton in nominal load rating is prohibited on the public streets or on or within privately owned driveways or property within any residentially zoned district, except for loading or unloading purposes when rendering a service to the property. Furthermore, this parking prohibition shall include all vehicles, regardless of load rating, which have more than six (6) weight-bearing wheels or vehicles with trailer combinations which are designed, intended or used for transportation of people, chattel or goods and used for purposes other than for a private passenger vehicle or use. Finally, this parking prohibition shall apply to all of the following vehicles, regardless of load rating: tow trucks, any vehicle with a crane or jib attached, any vehicle that is used commercially to transport insecticides, pesticides, poisons, noxious gases, septic tank residues, flammable liquids or gases, acids, alkalies, explosives or other dangerous substances or liquids. 
    Recreational vehicles are also exempt from this parking provision, but are subject to other applicable provisions of the Code. 
Cross reference- Limitations on trucks using certain streets within city limits, § 18-3; parking violations generally, § 18-11 et seq.; restrictions on parking trucks and other commercial vehicles, § 18-21 et seq. 
(V)  ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES. 
Residential Districts 
    Accessory uses and structures shall not be located in required front or side yards nor located nearer than seven and one-half (71/2) feet to a rear property line; provided, however, that accessory structures for the housing of persons, such as guest houses and garage apartments, shall not be located in any required yard. On double frontage, through, or corner lots in residential districts, accessory uses and structures shall not be located in either of the front yards, but may be located in one but not both required side yards. However, in no case shall they be located closer than seven and one-half (71/2) feet to any side yard property line. 
A.  Air conditioner compressor units. 
Residential districts. Air conditioner compressor units in residential zoning districts shall not be located in any required yard and must be located no farther than three feet (3') from the principal structure which it serves. However, where, as the effective date of Ord. No. 1084, an existing air conditioner compressor unit is within a required rear or side yard, a replacement air conditioner compressor unit may be located in the same location. 
In residential districts where a replacement unit is permitted in a required side or rear yard, air conditioner compressor units closer than five feet (5') from any side or rear property line, or within the required side or rear yard and higher than thirty inches (30?) above ground level, must comply with the following ARI Sound Ratings in accordance with ARI Standard 270-95. (The ARI Standard was prepared by the Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration Institute to establish a method of sound-rating outdoor unitary equipment in terms of sound pressure levels.): 
Unit Size ARI Sound Rating 4 ton units and under 80 decibels (8.0 bels) or less Between 4 and 5 ton units 84 decibels (8.4 bels) or less 5 ton units or greater Prohibited from required yards in residential districts  
For Winfield Units 1 and 2 (Single-Family Residential Subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance No. 970, replacement units shall be permitted in pre-existing locations. Replacement units increased in size or relocated, shall be subject to sound rating specifications listed above. Air conditioning units shall be screened with landscaping if located within any street side yard, subject to no hazardous obstruction to visibility for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Screening shall be implemented when an air conditioning unit is replaced and is increased in size or relocated. 
Nonresidential districts. For properties located in non-residential districts, the air conditioner compressor unit, chiller and/or evaporator unit of a proposed building/structure's air handler system shall not be located in any required yard. 
Screening for these units may be accomplished by a closed fence or wall which is at least six (6) feet high and is compatible with the principal building. The height of the fence or wall may be required to be increased if the height of the proposed unit exceeds six (6) feet in height and is visible from adjacent property or adjacent right-of-way. Likewise, the fence or wall may be eliminated if screened by adjacent structures so as not to be visible from adjacent property or right-of-way. 
Additional planting materials shall be provided so that no more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the surface area of the closed fence or wall is visible from the street or adjacent properties within three (3) years of erection of the structure. The screening may also be accomplished with a natural evergreen plant material which can be expected to reach six (6) feet or greater in height within two (2) years of planting. Any plant material used to fulfill these requirements shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height when planted, and there shall be no gap greater than two (2) feet between plant foliage. Access points to the unit(s) must also be screened with gates if it is visible from the road, public right-of-way or adjacent property. Landscape materials may be waived if the unit is placed on a roof so that it not visible from adjacent right-of-way or property. Likewise, trees may be required to achieve the necessary screening if the proposed unit is greater than six (6) feet high and is visible from adjacent right-of-way or property. 
All decisions on location and screening requirements shall be made by the city manager or designee, with any appeal to the decision made to the planning and zoning commission within thirty (30) days of such decision. 
As of the effective date of this ordinance, where an existing air conditioner unit, chiller and/or evaporator unit is within a required rear or side yard, a replacement unit may be located in the same location. Likewise, where an existing air compressor unit, chiller and/or evaporator is being replaced, the replacement unit is allowed to be installed in the pre-existing location but may not be increased in size or height without meeting the other provisions of this section. (Ord. No. 795, § 1, 9-14-92; Ord. No. 945, § 1, 6-8-98) 
B.  Swimming pools and pool screen enclosures. Swimming pools for private residential uses and pool screen enclosures are accessory uses. Such pools and pool screen enclosures shall be constructed in full compliance with all applicable city, state, and county regulations. 
No pool (excluding surrounding patio) shall be located closer to the side yard property line of the lot, parcel, or piece of land upon which said pool is located than the distance required by the zoning ordinances of the city for side yards in the zone in which the property is located plus three feet (3'), nor less than ten feet (10') from the rear property line. No pool shall be located nearer to the front line of the lot, parcel, or piece of land than the main or principal building or residence to which the pool is an accessory. 
For Dommerich Hills, Dommerich Hills 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Additions (single-family residential subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance 1023, no pool shall extend nearer to street than the residence, with a minimum front yard requirement of twenty feet (20'). No pool shall be located closer than five feet (5') from any side or rear yard property line. 
For Winfield Units 1 and 2 (single-family residential subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance No. 970, no pool shall be located in the front yard of the principal building. No pool shall be located closer than five feet (5') from any side or rear yard property line, nor closer than fifteen feet (15') from any street side yard property line. Pool equipment shall be screened by landscaping if located within any front or street side yard, subject to no hazardous obstruction to visibility for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. These screening elements shall be implemented when new swimming pool construction occurs, or when a pool is replaced or altered requiring a permit. (Ord. No. 1084, Sec. 3, 5/24/04) 
1.  Screen enclosures shall not be located closer to the side yard property line than the side yard requirement established by the zoning ordinances of the city for the lot, parcel or piece of land upon which the pool is located, nor closer to the rear property line than seven feet (7'). 
a.  On lakefront property, no screen enclosure shall exceed in height the height of the highest point of the roof structure for the principal structure. Furthermore, a pool enclosure constructed at a distance less than fifty feet (50') from the control water elevation of a lake may not exceed a height of twelve feet (12'). (Ord. No. 857, Sec. 1, 12/12/94). 
For the area defined in Ordinance No. 799 as the "Mayo Avenue Area Annexation", swimming pool screen enclosures which were constructed, prior to the effective date of annexation, at a distance of less than seven and one-half (71/2) feet from a side yard property line, but not less than five feet (5'), will be allowed to replace the enclosure in the preexisting location, subject to all other City of Maitland Code requirements. (Ord. No. 858, Sec. 7, 12/12/94) 
For the area defined in Ordinance No. 859 as the "Druid Annexation Area", swimming pool screen enclosures which were constructed, prior to the effective date of annexation at a distance of less than seven and one-half (71/2) feet from a side yard property line, but not less than five feet (5'), will be allowed to replace the enclosure in the preexisting location, subject to all other City of Maitland Code requirements. (Ord. No. 904, Sec. 3, 7/8/96) 
For Winfield Units 1 and 2 (Single Family Residential Subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance No. 970, no pool enclosure shall be located within the front yard of the principal building, nor less than five feet (5') from any side or rear yard property line, nor less than fifteen feet (15') from any street side yard property line. (Ord. No. 1084, Sec. 3, 5/24/04) 
For Dommerich Hills, Dommerich Hills 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Additions (single-family residential subdivisions) annexed by Ordinance 1023, no swimming pool screen enclosure shall be located closer than five feet (5') from any side or rear yard property line. 
2.  Whenever in this chapter reference is made to the existing, normal or control water level, or high-water level, the level established by the Orange County Board of Commissioners shall be applied. Wherever such control levels have not been so established, the director of public works shall determine the approximate natural levels in accordance with available historical data. (Code 1959, § 13A-23; Ord. No. 270, § 6, 6-28-65) 
Cross reference- Swimming pools, § 5-148. 
County Code reference- Creation and duties of Orange County Pollution Control Board, § 24-1 et seq., Orange County Code. 
(VI)  Exceptions to height regulations. The height limitations contained in the schedule of district regulations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, or other appurtenances required to be placed on the roof and not intended for human occupancy (this exception, however, does not allow penthouses, mechanical or equipment room or air conditioning equipment to exceed the height limits); however, the heights of these structures or appurtenances thereto shall not exceed any height limitations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Agency if they are within the flight-approach zone of airports. With regard to the height of earth stations, the height limitations contained in the schedule of district regulations shall be superseded by section 21-5 (XV) of this chapter. 
(VII)  Buildings to have access. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, or with access to an approved private street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, other emergency vehicles, and required off-street parking. No dwelling shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not abut on at least one (1) public street or approved private street for at least twenty (20) feet. 
(VIII)  Parking, storage or use of major recreational equipment. For purposes of this zoning code, "major recreational equipment" is defined as including boats, houseboats, trailers, pickup campers or coaches (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), motor homes, tent trailers, cases or boxes used for transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by such equipment or not, airplanes, gliders and the like, and similar vehicles or items. A houseboat is defined as a barge or dwelling supported on the water by floats, whether or not it includes a motor, fitted for use as a dwelling or for leisurely cruising. 
    The parking of any major recreational equipment exceeding one hundred two (102) inches in width is prohibited in a residentially zoned district. Likewise, the parking or storage of any airplane, glider, or houseboat, regardless of size, is prohibited in any residentially zoned district. 
    The parking prohibition in the above paragraph shall also be applicable to any major recreational equipment, unless it complies with one (1) of the following: 
(1)  A boat is permitted to be docked in the water or in a boathouse or launch attached to a waterway. A boat trailer is permitted to be parked on a launch attached to a waterway. 
(2)  Any major recreational equipment may be parked or stored entirely within a garage or carport; or 
(3)  Any major recreational equipment currently registered in accordance with Florida state law, with a valid tag attached to equipment other than a boat and a valid sticker attached to a boat; and 
(a)  If it is a boat greater than two hundred (200) pounds, it must be operational and parked on a trailer on a paved or hard-packed driveway at least fifteen (15) feet from the edge of the pavement or road (if unpaved); or 
(b)  If other than a boat, it must be parked behind the nearest portion of a building to the street; boats may be parked behind the nearest portion of a building to the street. 
    Nevertheless, any major recreational equipment may be parked anywhere on a residential premises for not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours during any given week while loading or unloading. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use. 
    Any major recreational equipment under twenty-four (24) feet in length that are used daily as a private passenger vehicle by a resident of the property are exempt from the provisions of this parking prohibition, except that they must be parked at least fifteen (15) feet from the edge of the pavement or road (if unpaved). 
Cross reference- Traffic generally, Ch. 18. 
(IX)  Parking and storage of certain vehicles. Automotive vehicles or trailers of any kind or type which are not operable or are not properly licensed and registered shall not be parked or stored on any residentially zoned property other than in a completely enclosed building. 
(X)  Mobile homes, temporary structures and model homes. A mobile home, trailer, or temporary structure may be used as a temporary construction office or shelter for materials or tools (but not for residential purposes) incident to construction on, or development of, the premises on which the same is located; such use shall be strictly limited to the time construction or development is actively under way. In no event, however, shall the use continue more than six (6) months without the approval of the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission shall under no circumstances grant a time extension unless an active permit is in force and the time extension does not exceed an additional six (6) months. 
A modular home or home may be used only for office and sales purposes in an undeveloped subdivision where more than five (5) acres or ten (10) residential lots have been approved through the subdivision process and the subdivision comprises one hundred (100) per cent of the lots with access to the individual streets where direct access is to be obtained (no existing homes in a subdivision or unplatted parcel with direct access to the same street as subdivision). Furthermore, the modular home or home used as a temporary sales or office structure must not be located on a lot abutting an existing single-family residence in an adjacent developed subdivision or unplatted area. Finally, the modular home or home used as a temporary structure as an office or sales use must meet the following criteria:

(XV)  Satellite dishes. Unless otherwise provided for herein, a satellite dish is a structure which shall be an accessory use to the primary or principal use upon a lot. The following regulations shall apply to the location, height, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and existence of satellite dishes: 
(a)  Permit required. Every person intending to install or materially reconstruct a satellite dish shall apply for a building permit from the city prior to the installation or commencement of work on said satellite dish. 
(b)  Development standards. All satellite dishes shall be located, designed, constructed, treated, and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Location. 
a.  Residential districts. In residential zoning districts no satellite dish shall be located on any lot closer to any public or private street than the rear of any principal structure on said lot. Further, no satellite dish shall be located closer than fifteen (15) feet to any property line and may not be mounted or connected to any building. (All measurements shall be the horizontal distance between a property line and the nearest point of the dish antenna when actuated to its most horizontal position.) 
b.  Nonresidential districts. In nonresidential zoning districts, no satellite dish shall be located on any lot closer to any public or private street than the nearest portion of any principal structure to the street. Further, no satellite dish shall be located in any required yard. All satellite dishes shall be placed at ground level; structures three (3) stories in height or greater, however, may mount a satellite dish on the roof provided it is largely obscured from view. 
(2)  Aesthetics. Satellite dishes must be screened through the addition of architectural features or landscaping that is compatible and in harmony with the elements and characteristics of the lot upon which the satellite dish is located and, more importantly, with immediately adjacent lots and the neighborhood in which the satellite dish is to be located. 
All satellite dishes shall be either black or a shade of green that blends with surrounding green landscaping or painted in a corresponding color so as to blend in with the surrounding vegetation or buildings. No satellite dish shall be constructed without appropriate landscape or masonry screening so as to conceal said satellite dish from the view of any person from:1) any public or private street; 2) a public right-of-way; or 3) adjoining lot, except as stated herein. Placement of masonry or landscape forms of screening may be waived or reduced if the applicant can demonstrate to the city that to require screening as set forth herein would interfere with the reception of communications signals from orbiting satellites by the satellite dish. In such instances the screening requirements may be waived or reduced but only to the extent that reception of communications signals is interfered by the screening requirements. 
(3)  Satellite dish height; dish diameter. 
a.  In residential zoning districts, a satellite dish shall not exceed a height of seven (7) feet, with the height measured from the ground to the nearest point of the dish antenna when actuated to its most horizontal position. The maximum diameter permitted for any satellite dish shall be ten (10) feet. 
b.  In non-residential zoning districts, a satellite dish shall not exceed a height of fourteen (14) feet. The maximum diameter permitted for any satellite dish shall be thirteen (13) feet. 
(4)  Limit on number of satellite dishes. 
a.  In residential districts only one (1) such satellite dish shall be permitted on any lot in the city. 
b.  In multi-family residential or any nonresidential zoning district more than one (1) satellite dish is permitted on any lot provided the said dishes are less than three (3) feet in diameter and less than four (4) feet in height. For dishes larger than three (3) feet in diameter more than one (1) satellite dish may be approved by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with a modified site plan review process, with application materials subject to the approval of the community development director. Before approval for multiple dishes may be granted, it must be proven that: 
1.  There is a need for more than one (1) dish to serve a commercial, office or multi-family use. 
2.  Each such satellite dish shall be actively and electronically connected on a continuous basis for use as a receiver or transmitter of electronic signals. 
3.  No satellite dish shall be linked physically or electronically, to a receiver which is not located on the same lot as is the satellite dish, except as approved through the site plan review process. 
4.  Said satellite dish must be adequately buffered from view as provided in section 21-5XV.B.2. 
5.  The public health, safety, welfare, interest, and aesthetics will be adequately protected, and not adversely affected by the installation of said satellite dish. 
6.  Conditions of approval may be imposed to mitigate any negative impact from the installation of the satellite dish. The cost of such condition to the applicant shall be considered coequally with the public benefit to be deprived from said condition. 
(5)  Mobile or portable satellite dishes. For the purpose of this section, a "mobile satellite dish" is any satellite dish that is mounted on wheels. As used in this section, "portable satellite dish" is any satellite dish not permanently attached to the ground and that may be carried or moved about. Mobile satellite dishes are included within the definition or portable satellite dishes. Portable satellite dishes shall comply with the provisions of section 21-5XV.B.6. No portable satellite dish shall be permitted within the city until a portable satellite dish permit has been obtained from the city. Written application shall be made to the building official and shall at a minimum include the name, address and telephone listing of the lot owner, the legal entity and individual in charge of or responsible for the portable satellite dish; identifying serial number or insignia of the portable satellite dish; time at which the portable satellite dish will first be placed upon the lot; and any other information which the city manager shall determine is required to be furnished to clarify the application or protect the health and safety of the citizens of Maitland. 
Said portable satellite dish permit shall be valid for a period of twenty-four (24) hours, which time period shall commence as of the hour at which the applicant intends to place the portable satellite dish on the property, all as specified in the application form. No portable satellite dish permit shall be issued for permission to install a portable satellite dish on any lot more than once in any calendar month. No portable satellite dish permit shall be issued if a notice of any report made by the United States of America National Weather Service (or its successor agency) that a hurricane or other form of inclement weather having hurricane force winds or higher has been issued which might strike Orange or Seminole County. 
(6)  Signs. Any satellite dish having symbols, numbers, or letters larger than one (1) inch in size thereon shall be subject to the sign regulations in the City of Maitland City Code.

Sec. 21-6. - Schedule of district regulations adopted. 
(I)  Matrix 1 District Regulations . District regulations shall be as set forth in the schedule of district regulations, hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this zoning code, and in section 21-5 of this zoning code, entitled "Supplementary District Regulations," and as incorporated in Matrix 1, district requirements, herein. 
(II)  Matrix 2-Downtown Maitland District Regulations . 
(a)  Applicability. Where any provision of section 21-6 is in conflict with any other standards or regulations within the Downtown Maitland Redevelopment Plan, the standards contained herein shall prevail. 
(b)  Flexibility in design standards. Administrative deviations from the dimensional standards contained in this section may be requested per section 23-2.2. No deviations from the density or intensity regulations may be considered. 
(c)  Development density and intensity. Sites within the Downtown Maitland Zoning District shall meet the following density and intensity requirements. For the purpose of calculating density and/or intensity within the downtown core area, as defined in the comprehensive development plan, a single development site may be on different sides of Independence Lane within the same block as long as all other Code requirements (e.g. height, open space, pervious area, etc.), with or without approved incentives, are met on each building site within the development site and conditional use approval is obtained.

DU/AC = dwelling unit per acre 
(d)  Minimum living area. Residential units shall have a minimum living area of five hundred (500) square feet. 
(e)  Building height. 
(1)  Buildings shall not exceed five (5) stories in height. 
(2)  The minimum required building height for buildings within the downtown core, as defined in the comprehensive development plan, shall be two (2) stories. All other buildings may have a single story but a minimum building height of twenty-three (23) feet. Building additions of less than two thousand (2,000) square feet in the DMZD shall be exempt from this provision. 
(3)  For the purpose of this section, building height shall be measured in stories. However, to ensure adequate floor-to-ceiling height, the ground floor of nonresidential uses shall have a minimum clear height, measured from slab to slab, of fourteen (14) feet. Other floors shall have a minimum clear height of nine (9) feet. 
(4)  Compliance to floor height regulations shall only apply to new buildings or where the applicant is already proposing to modify the floor height of an existing building. 
(5)  Roof structures above eave line can vary in height up to a maximum of fifteen (15) feet above eave line. Roof appurtenances are exempt from height regulations as provided in section 21-5(VI). 
(6)  Buildings shall provide a horizontal step back along the street to ensure that multiple storied building facades do not overwhelm the pedestrian orientation and scale of the downtown. Therefore, all stories above the fourth story shall be stepped back a minimum of an additional ten (10) feet from the build-to-line or edge of arcade/gallery if one (1) is provided. This provision does not prevent developers from using step backs on other floors or along other streets as long as the step backs are only applied above the second story. Refer to section 21-6(II)(f)(6) for compatibility standards adjacent to residential uses. 
(f)  Setbacks. 
(1)  New development and redevelopment shall meet the following building setbacks. For the purpose of this section, front refers to all sides of the site facing a public right-of-way and shall be measured from the edge of the sidewalk as shown in section 23-2.4.1. Please refer to section 23-2.4 to identify the street type. 
  Street Type I: eight (8) feet (required build-to-line for block frontage continuity) 
  Street Type II: eight (8) feet (required build-to-line for block frontage continuity) 
  Street Type III: eight (8) feet minimum to twenty (20) feet maximum 
NOTE: Minor insets at the build-to-line of up to eight (8) feet in depth are permitted for the purpose of providing facade articulation and architectural interest; the insets added together shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the length of the facade. 
(2)  Whenever an arcade is proposed along the front of a building, such arcade and floors above may, under certain conditions, extend in front of the build-to-line as provided for in sections 23-2.4.1 and 23-2.5.3. An arcade may extend over a sidewalk easement area for use for the public, but in no event shall extend over public property. The city and property owner shall execute an easement and maintenance agreement to address requirements necessary to protect the city and the public regarding use of the easement area. 
(3)  Should the required setback/build-to-line fall within a FDOT right-of-way, it shall be shifted to the property line instead. 
(4)  See section 23-2.5.3 for development allowed within the setback/activity area. 
(5)  Except as provided in subsection (II)(f)(6) and section 23-2.5.6(e), there shall be no minimum side or rear yard setbacks required. However, if a zero (0) foot side setback is not proposed there shall be a minimum ten (10) foot separation between the buildings on adjacent sites for fire safety. There is a seven and one-half (7.5) foot minimum building setback required from the railroad right-of-way for maintenance. 
(6)  Non-residential and multi-family developments abutting a residential zoning district shall comply with the following requirements:

Sec. 21-21. - PD, planned development district. 
I.  Generally. It is the purpose of this district to permit planned developments which are intended: 
(a)  To encourage the development of land as planned communities and developments providing a variety of complementary and compatible residential, commercial, and industrial use or combination of uses. 
(b)  To allow diversification of uses, structures, and open spaces in a manner compatible with existing and permitted land use on abutting properties. 
(c)  To encourage flexible and creative concepts of site planning. 
(d)  To provide for an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lowering development and housing costs. 
(e)  To permit more effective adaptation of development to the natural soils, vegetation and topography of an area. 
(f)  To preserve the natural amenities and environmental assets of the land by encouraging the preservation and improvement of scenic and functional open areas. 
(g)  To encourage an increase in the amount and useability of open space areas by permitting a more economical and concentrated use of building areas than would be possible through conventional subdivision practices. 
(h)  To insure that development will occur according to limitations of use, design, density, coverage, and phasing stipulated on an approved final development plan. 
(i)  To encourage large scale, multiple-use planned developments which can aid the city in controlling the tempo and sequence of growth by maintaining a balance of land uses in conjunction with the growth of municipal facilities and services needed to serve the new population. 
(j)  To encourage economic viability within the Packwood District of Downtown Maitland as the focal point of the Downtown revitalization area, including the City's Town Center. The district is located generally from Lake Lily Park north to Sybelia Avenue and is intended to create a pedestrian-oriented mix of public and private spaces, the combination of which will promote walkability and activation of the retail core area of the city's downtown. 
(k)  To revitalize the areas within the Sawmill and Waterhouse Districts of Downtown Maitland as these districts serve as the northern and southern entries to Downtown Maitland and are intended to achieve the vision of an architecturally pleasing corridor with a mix of uses and safe, walkable pedestrian access. 
(II)  Permitted uses. Each land use shall be complementary to and compatible with the project concept or theme for the total planned development district. 
(a)  Residential units, including single-family attached and detached dwellings, tow-family dwellings, and multiple-family dwellings. 
(b)  Churches, schools, community or club buildings, and similar public and semipublic facilities.

(1)  The location is in appropriate relation to other land uses. 
(2)  The proposed uses are compatible with the goals and objectives of the city's comprehensive development plan. 
(III)  Development standards for planned development. The development standards for planned development are as follows: 
(a)  Relation to zoning districts. An approved PD shall be considered to be a separate zoning district in which a final development plan approved for each phase establishes the restrictions, regulations, and district description according to which the development shall occur. Upon approval of the preliminary development plan, the official zoning map shall be changed to indicate the area as PD. Each final development plan as approved by the city council shall be filed and maintained within the community development department with a copy to the building official. 
(b)  Density/intensity. The density/intensity based on gross residential/commercial acreage permitted in each PD development shall be established by the city council upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. The criteria for establishing the appropriate density/intensity includes existing surrounding density/intensity, density/intensity permitted by the existing zoning classification, adequacy of existing and proposed public facilities and services, conformance with the adopted city comprehensive plan, and site characteristics, but in no case shall it exceed the maximum density/intensity of the most dense/intense zoning district in the appropriate land use district. 
(c)  Dimensional, bulk and height restrictions. The location of all proposed building sites shall be as shown on the final section plat or site plan subject to the minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverage, and minimum floor areas as specified in the final development plan as approved by the city council. Buildings or structures shall not exceed the floor area ratio established in the CDP. 
(d)  Access and parking. All streets, and access ways shall be designed to effectively relate to the major transportation plan as shown in the comprehensive development plan of the city. Off-street parking shall be provided for each land use as established by the off-street parking regulations of the Maitland Code of Ordinances and shall meet landscaping requirements as specified in the landscape ordinance for off street parking and other vehicular use areas established in the Maitland Code of Ordinances. Vehicular access from individual lots or dwelling units onto public arterial or collector streets within or adjacent to the development is prohibited. 
(e)  Perimeter requirements. The city council, following a recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, may impose one (1) or both of the following requirements in order to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses: 
(1)  Structures, parking lots, buildings and streets located at the perimeter of the development shall be permanently screened in a manner which sufficiently protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent existing uses. 
(2)  Wide setbacks from the perimeter line may be imposed to protect privacy of adjacent existing uses. 
(f)  Stormwater drainage systems. Provisions shall be made for one-hundred-percent on-site drainage retention/detention and special disposition of stormwater drainage when such drainage could substantially harm a natural body of water. Approval of self-contained stormwater drainage systems shall adhere to the procedures outlined in the Maitland Code of Ordinances. 
(g)  Maitland West Side Design Standards. Any exceptions to the Maitland West Side Design Standards, including block configurations, access standards, pedestrian connection requirements and lot layout requirements shall be made through the exception process described in section 7.5-81. 
(h)  Sawmill, Packwood and Waterhouse Districts within Downtown Maitland. 
(1)  Consideration of petitions for PD zoning development projects including, ground floor residential development within the Sawmill, Packwood and Waterhouse Districts, shall be subject to additional criteria provided in the Maitland City Code, Chapter 7.5, Article VII, Planned Development, and section 21-19(b), and section 23-2, Downtown Maitland Special District. The location of ground-floor residential uses within each district will be evaluated based upon compatibility with surrounding uses, character of the surrounding areas, street type, road visibility, street frontage, access, and the purpose and intent of each district. 
(2)  A "live/work unit" is a single unit, that is part of a PD zoning development project within these districts, that consists of both a commercial/office component and residential component occupied by the same resident. A live/work unit shall be considered a residential use only. No live/work unit, or any portion of a live/work unit, shall be considered a commercial use in whole or in part. However, the commercial/office component of the live/work unit shall be restricted to uses consistent with those specified within the DMZD zoning district. The live/work unit shall be evaluated consistent with the criteria noted in (h)(1) above. 
(Ord. No. 763, § 1, 11-26-90; Ord. No. 1220, § 1(Exh. A, § 5), 10-24-11; Ord. No. 1305, § 3, 4-11-16 ) 
Sec. 21-22. - Off-street parking and loading. 
    It is the intent of this zoning code that the public interest, welfare, and safety requires that every building and use erected or instituted after the effective date of this zoning code shall be provided with adequate off-street parking facilities for the use of occupants, employees, visitors, customers, or patrons. It is also the intent of this zoning code that the public interest, welfare, and safety require that certain uses provide adequate off-street loading facilities. Such off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be maintained and continued so long as the main use continues. 
(1)  Generally. Off-street parking facilities shall be provided as set out herein. Required off-street parking areas for three (3) or more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so designed, maintained and regulated that no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public street, walk or alley, and so that any automobile may be parked and unparked without moving another. Building existing as of the effective date of this zoning code may be modernized, altered, or repaired without providing additional off-street parking or off-street loading facilities, providing there is no increase in floor area, volume, capacity or space occupied. Where a building or use existed as of the effective date of this zoning code and such building or use is enlarged in floor area, volume, capacity, or space occupied, off-street parking and off-street loading as herein specified shall be provided for the additional floor area, volume, capacity, or space so created or used. 
Change in use of a building or use existing as of the effective date of this zoning code shall require additional off-street parking and off-street loading facilities to the extent that requirements for such facilities exceed the off-street parking and off-street loading requirements which would have been required for the previous use had the regulations of this zoning code been applicable thereto. 
The required off-street parking facilities shall be: 
(a)  Identified as to purpose and location when not clearly evident. 
(b)  Unless otherwise requested by the applicant and approved by the city manager, surfaced with asphalt, bituminous, or concrete material and maintained in a smooth, well-grade condition. Single-family and two-family residences are exempt from this requirement. Driveways, access aisles, and parking spaces for public and private schools offering academic courses and for churches may be surfaced with grass or lawn. 
(c)  Drained so as not to cause any nuisance on adjacent property. 
(d)  So lighted (if required or desired) as to prevent glare or excessive light on adjacent property. 
(e)  Arranged for convenient access and to minimize hazard to the safety of pedestrians and vehicles. For this purpose, the parking shall conform to the minimum standards as noted in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Transportation and Traffic Engineering Handbook, Second Edition or as may be amended from time to time. All parking shall be a standard size (nine (9) feet wide by eighteen (18) feet long with twenty-four (24) foot aisle widths, is acceptable if ninety (90) degree stalls are proposed). Up to fifteen (15) percent of the spaces required by city regulations may be designed for compact vehicles (minimum eight (8) feet wide by sixteen (16) feet long) if designated appropriately on site.

(2)  Off-site shared parking. The owner(s) or operator(s) of parcels requiring off-street parking facilities which are within six hundred (600) feet of each other may make collective provision for such facilities.

The plan shall accurately designate the required parking spaces, access aisles and driveways, and the relation of the off-street parking facilities to the uses or structures such facilities are designed to serve. 
(4)  Employee parking. Where off-street parking facilities are specified on the basis of number of employees, such parking shall be clearly marked and reserved for use of such employees. Where a use is required to provide and reserve a certain number of spaces for employees and the number of employees increases after the building is occupied, then the amount of off-street parking provided shall be increased in ratio to the increase to the number of employees.

Off-street loading facilities are required by this zoning code so that vehicles engaged in unloading will not encroach on or interfere with the public use of streets and alleys by pedestrians and so that adequate space is available for the unloading and loading of goods, materials, or items for delivery and shipping. 
When the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring off-street loading facilities, the full amount of off-street loading space required shall be supplied and maintained.

Each off-street loading space shall be directly accessible from a street or alley without crossing or entering any other required off-street loading space. There shall be no loading or unloading of commercial vehicles on the public street.

Sec. 21-24. - Residential scale and character. 
(I)  General. In determining residential scale and character, the city shall consider as a general guideline whether the building(s) exhibit architectural elements and features characteristic of residential structures of similar scale and mass, with consideration given to size and shape of the building(s); pitch of the roofs; type of building materials used; building fenestrations and detailing, whether there is an abundance of landscaping, and site organization, and giving articulation to the appearance of a smaller and reduced parking mass. 
(II)  Criteria for review. The following criteria shall serve as a framework to review development applications, but shall not mandate that every element must be provided. Final determination as to whether a development is of residential scale and character shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate City of Maitland board charged with reviewing the application for development. 
(a)  Building shapes and form. Buildings with lengthy unbroken facades should be avoided. As a general guide, the maximum horizontal length of an unbroken facade plane should be fifty-feet. Facade off-sets should be incorporated to create shadow lines. An essential character of residential scale is a traditional appearance of building walls and openings. Walls define the overall form of the building while openings give them human scale. 
Residential character building components include elements such as, decks, and balconies, and roof configurations which reflect traditional residential features such as pitched, hip, or gable. Residential character can also include parapets and a combination of flat and pitched roofs. Height limitations or design preferences may dictate a flat roof. 
(b)  Building fenestration and detailing may incorporate window features such as: punched, as opposed to banded or continuous windows; groupings of windows that are not generally found in larger office or residential buildings, and which may be separately defined by mullions, may include muntins, multi-pane windows, double-hung windows or casement windows; crown and other moldings; overhangs; soffits; building ornamentation; and architectural elements such as doorways, archways, arches and columns, dormers, and gables. Clearly defined entries facing the street should be provided. Features that visually reduce the height, mass and scale of the structure such as clearly defining the base, middle, and cap of the building, address residential scale and character. 
(c)  Site organization may be used to establish residential character, including clustering of buildings, the manner in which buildings are organized on the site, and building massing where special attention is made to its massing by the grouping of forms and spaces to reflect more of a human scale. Creating friendly pedestrian scaled exterior spaces by grouping of smaller structures, as well as indenting or setting back some upper floors or portions of upper floors add an element of residential scale. Buildings should be located so that the front door faces the main street. 
(d)  Building materials. Brick, accents of brick, stucco, stone, wood or natural materials are generally more reflective of residential character. The scale of materials should be smaller and relate to a more fine-grained character reflective of residential architecture, i.e., using brick to create a smaller modular scale instead of large panels and using architectural detailing, including trim, framing, fenestration, and articulation, is encouraged instead of creating continuous uniform surfaces. 
On-site parking. Parking should be deemphasized as much as possible. If possible, parking should not be placed in the front of the building, but if so located shall be screened by hedges and other landscape materials and may include the incorporation of a low screen wall approximately twenty-four (24) to thirty (30) inches in height. 
Parking lots should be screened or broken up by landscaping. Reduced parking mass in lieu of an expanse of parking should be provided. Surface stormwater facilities such as stormwater ponds and swales should be integrated into the parking lot design, incorporating landscaping and other aesthetic treatments and used as amenities. 
(e)  Landscape design and amenities. The following landscape design and amenities principals shall be considered: incorporation of unique and existing trees into the landscape design, use of layering to promote informality with a variety of plants with differing mature heights, use wide variety of plants in informal arrangements, use of plants or trees which have seasonal color; accommodate the topography in site planning, including planted slopes; incorporate other site amenities such as a gazebo, trellis, and yard/site furniture, to help create the perception of a residential development.

Sec. 23-2. - Downtown Maitland Special District purpose and intent. 
    The function of the Downtown Maitland Special District is to guide future development and redevelopment toward creating an attractive urban pattern that balances the pedestrian and traffic needs of residents, and to encourage, but not require, mixed-use development by generally desiring residential use development to be provided above commercial and/or office use, while it protects and enhances the original pattern of development consistent with the goals of the City's Comprehensive Plan, Downtown Master Plan, and the Downtown Maitland Revitalization Plan. 
    Downtown Maitland extends generally from Maitland Boulevard on the north to the CSX Railroad Overpass on the South and includes three sub-districts referred to as the Sawmill, Packwood, and Waterhouse Districts. The Packwood District is the focal point of the Downtown Maitland revitalization area and includes the City's Town Center and Core Area. 
    The intent of the Packwood District is to encourage economic viability by creating a mixture of public and private uses to promote walkability and activation of the retail core of the City's Downtown. The Packwood District represents the heart of the city and is intended for a vigorous mixture of commercial and residential uses that create a magnetic gathering place for citizens. It will contain a concentration of commercial, civic and cultural uses, interspersed with mixed use developments and urban open spaces. Buildings will be positioned close to the street to encourage pedestrian activity and to create a Main Street Urban Pattern. Design components central to the intent include clustering of buildings, buildings with distinctive storefronts, balconies and inviting entrances, as well as outdoor seating and cafes that interact with the street. Buildings will have diverse architectural types which incorporate decorative elements and attractive roof elements. 
    The Sawmill and Waterhouse Districts serve as the northern and southern entries to Downtown Maitland and are intended to achieve the vision of a pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use area. The Sawmill District represents the north gateway to the City and includes Maitland's SunRail station. The focus of this district is to create a transit- supportive place. The area will be based upon transit- oriented principles, such as a pedestrian and bicycle friendly environment with a compact and functional mix of uses. Design components central to the intent include: a mix of residential, employment and supporting retail and service uses, high densities/intensities around the transit station, and compact development form, (grouping of buildings to allow for easy pedestrian access between buildings). Building architecture will include façade treatments that reduce building scale to include gables, covered walks, awnings, storefront windows and building interaction with the sidewalk system. 
    The Waterhouse district represents the southern gateway to the City. The focus of the district is a safe, compact, pedestrian-friendly mixed use business district that serves neighborhoods within walking distance. Design components central to the intent include buildings with distinctive store fronts, balconies, and entrances that connect with the street, buildings with decorative elements and roofs which encourage a variety of street views, and diverse architectural styles. 
    Additional criteria have been established for ground-floor residential development within the Packwood, Sawmill and Waterhouse Districts to promote economic viability and to achieve a mixture of uses for Downtown Maitland. (Refer to section 21-21 Planned Development and Chapter 7.5 Article VII). The location of ground-floor residential within each district will be evaluated based upon compatibility with surrounding uses, the character of the surrounding areas, street types, road visibility, street frontage, access, and the purpose and intent of each district. 
    The design and land development standards are intended to be flexible and encourage design diversity and variation. The criteria for development in the district will ensure that the architectural integrity and details of existing significant structures are maintained, and will affirm the appropriateness of new development into the historic fabric of the area.
