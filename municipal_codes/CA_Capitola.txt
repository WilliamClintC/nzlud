3.11.030 Purpose.
The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A. To impose a permanent retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes.

D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 976 § 3, 2012)

3.11.040 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transaction and use tax ordinance; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

3.11.050 Transactions tax rate.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated and unincorporated territory of the city at the rate of one quarter of one percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this chapter.

(Ord. 976 § 5, 2012)

3.11.060 Place of sale.
For the purpose of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 976 § 6, 2012)

3.32.010 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter.

A. “Fee administrator” means the city manager or such person as is appointed by him or her to fulfill the position.

B. “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

C. “Occupancy” means the renting of any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

D. “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance with both.

E. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

F. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

G. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired, unless there is a lease between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.030 Fee/tax imposed. Revised 1/19
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a general tax in an amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment by the operator to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the fee administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the fee administrator. The general tax revenues of eleven and one-quarter percent shall be placed in the city’s general fund; four-tenths percent shall be allocated exclusively to local business groups for marketing and community improvements, and thirty-five-hundredths percent shall be allocated exclusively to youth and early childhood programs. (Ord. 1024 § 1, 2018; Ord. 843 § 1, 2002; Ord. 702 § 2, 1990; Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the fee imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of fee shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.060 Registration.
Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the fee administrator and obtain from him or her a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A. The name of the operator;

B. The address of the hotel;

C. The date upon which the certificate was issued;

D. This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face thereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient Occupancy Fee Ordinance by registering with the Fee Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Fee and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.070 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the fee administrator, make a report to the fee administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the report is filed, the full amount of the fees collected shall be remitted to the fee administrator. The fee administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the fee and he or she may require further information in the return. Reports and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All fees collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the fee administrator. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.080 Penalties and interest.
Any operator who fails to remit any fee imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the fee in addition to the amount of the fee.

A. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first becomes delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the fee in addition to the amount of the fee and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

B. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any fee imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the fee, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.090 Failure to collect and report fee – Determination of fee by fee administrator.
If any operator fails or refuses to collect the fee and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the fee or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the fee administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the fee due. As soon as the fee administrator procures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any fee imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the fee, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the fee administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. If no address is known, the notice shall be sent to the address of the hotel. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the fee administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the fee, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the fee administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the fee administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such fee, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified fee, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the fee administrator shall determine the proper fee to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such fee, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.32.100. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.100 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the fee administrator with respect to the amount of such fee, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any fee imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such fee, as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the fee administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 513 (part), 1932)

3.32.120 Refunds.
Whenever the amount of any fee, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded provided:

A. A claim in writing thereof, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the fee administrator within eighteen months of the date of payment;

B. Any additional information requested by the fee administrator is provided; and

C. Providing the fee administrator finds the claim to be meritorious. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.130 Actions to collect.
Any fee required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such fee collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city of Capitola for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 513 (part), 1982)

3.32.140 Violations.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be punishable in the manner provided in Section 1.01.090 and Title 4 of this code.

Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the fee administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is punishable as aforesaid.

The general remedies include mediation, facilitation, issuance and recordation of notices of violation, administrative civil penalties, administrative citations, summary abatement, and administrative abatement.

The city council finds there is a need for mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution as a means to gain compliance with provisions of this code and applicable state codes.

Sections:

4.24.070    Repayment to code enforcement civil penalties fund.

4.24.010 Declaration of purpose.
The city council finds that, in addition to the filing of civil collection actions by the city attorney, the use of nuisance abatement liens collected as personal obligations against property owners, and the use of special assessments on real property will assist in the collection of penalties, abatement costs, administrative costs, reinspection fees and late fees assessed pursuant to administrative citations, administrative hearings, judicial orders and other appropriate code enforcement actions. The city council further finds that collection of penalties, costs and fees assessed for code enforcement violations is important in deterring future violations and maintaining the integrity of-the city’s code enforcement system. The city has the authority to make the expense of enforcement actions and abatement of any nuisance a lien against the property on which it is maintained and a personal obligation against the property owner, in accordance with California Government Code Section 38773.1; or in the alternative, the city has the authority to make the cost of abatement of a nuisance upon a parcel of land a special assessment against that parcel, in accordance with California Government Code Section 38773.5. The procedures established in this chapter shall be used to complement existing administrative or judicial remedies, which may be pursued to address violations of this code or applicable state codes. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.020 Procedures for recovering costs.
This chapter governs the procedures for recovery of all administrative and actual costs incurred by the city in the recovery of civil penalties, in the abatement of a public nuisance, and for recordation and recovery of costs of enforcing nuisance abatement liens pursuant to the procedures and authority found in the California Government Code. The provisions of Government Code Section 38771 through 38773.5 and any amendments to those sections are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.030 Recovery of civil penalties.
The enforcement official may collect all civil penalties and related administrative costs by the use of all appropriate legal means, including referral to the finance director or city attorney. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.040 Confirmation of costs hearing.
A. After the city has abated a public nuisance, the enforcement official shall request the city manager to schedule a cost confirmation hearing before the city council. A cost confirmation hearing is also appropriate if the city incurred abatement preparation costs before a responsible person or property owner voluntarily abated the public nuisance.

B. A notice of the date, time and place of the cost confirmation hearing shall be served on the responsible person or property owner at least ten calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing by any one of the methods set forth in Chapter 4.03.

C. A copy of the report describing the work performed and an itemized account of the total abatement costs prepared pursuant to this chapter shall also be served on the responsible person or property owner at least ten calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing by any one of the methods set forth in Chapter 4.03.

D. The city council at the cost confirmation hearing shall limit the scope of review to the enforcement official’s report describing the work performed and the itemized account of costs together with any objections to its accuracy. The city council may make such revisions, corrections or modification in the report or the account as may be just and reasonable.

E. The city council may issue an order, which assesses the costs as either a personal obligation against the responsible person or property owner or a special assessment against the real property abated by the city.

F. At the cost confirmation hearing, the city council shall not consider evidence regarding the merits of a previous abatement hearing and shall not review a decision ordering administrative or summary abatement, or imposition of penalties.

G. The city council’s order confirming or modifying the amount of costs incurred by the city in performing the abatement shall be final. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.050 Recovery of costs as a personal obligation.
If the city council orders that abatement costs be charged as a personal obligation of the responsible person, the enforcement official shall collect the obligation by use of all appropriate legal means. This may include the recordation of a nuisance abatement lien against the real property on which a nuisance is maintained. An enforcement official may assess a nuisance abatement lien pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.1 by following the procedures set forth in this chapter including the requirements set forth below:

A. Once a final administrative decision or judicial order establishes the amount of penalties, abatement costs, administrative fees and costs assessed against a responsible person for code violations, the enforcement official may record a nuisance abatement lien against the real property on which the nuisance is maintained.

B. Before recordation, the enforcement official shall provide to the responsible person or property owner a written notice of intent to record nuisance abatement lien, informing such person that a nuisance abatement lien will be recorded unless the city receives full payment for the outstanding amount of civil penalties, costs, and fees within the time period prescribed in the notice. Such notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure, commencing at Section 415.10 et seq. Payment shall be due a minimum of ten calendar days from the date of the mailing.

C. If the property owner cannot be found after a diligent search, the notice can be posted on the property for a period of ten calendar days and the notice must be published in a general circulation newspaper once at least ten calendar days prior to recordation of the nuisance abatement lien.

D. A nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Santa Cruz County recorder’s office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien.

E. The nuisance abatement lien shall include the name of the agency on whose behalf the lien is imposed, the name of the property owner, responsible party and any financial institution with a legal interest in the property, the property’s assessor’s parcel number, the property’s legal description, the total amount of civil penalties, costs and fees due, including a breakdown of penalty assessments and reimbursement for the city’s administrative costs and a copy of any administrative or judicial order which awarded the civil penalties, costs and fees.

F. Once payment in full is received for the outstanding civil penalties and costs or the amount is deemed satisfied pursuant to a subsequent administrative or judicial order, the enforcement official shall either record a notice of cancellation or provide the property owner or financial institution with the notice of cancellation so they can record this notice with the Santa Cruz County recorder’s office. The notice of cancellation shall include the same information as provided for in the original nuisance abatement lien as described in Chapter 4.24. Such notice of cancellation shall cancel the nuisance abatement lien.

G. A copy of the recorded nuisance abatement lien shall be served upon the responsible person or property owner by one of the methods of service set forth in Chapter 4.03.

H. The failure of any person with a financial interest in the property to actually receive the notice of the lien shall not affect the validity of the lien or any proceedings taken to collect the outstanding civil penalties.

I. A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money judgment. If unable to collect the nuisance abatement lien, the enforcement official may refer the case to the city attorney to file a court action to recover the costs.

J. The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.060 Recovery of costs by special assessment.
A. Once a final administrative decision or judicial order establishes that the amount of penalties, abatement costs, administrative fees and costs be charged against the property as a special assessment, the enforcement official shall prepare a notice of special assessment.

B. The enforcement official shall deliver the notice of special assessment to the county auditor who shall place it on the county assessment roll pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5.

C. The notice of special assessment shall include a copy of the hearing officer’s cost confirmation order and shall summarize the abatement action. The enforcement official may record a copy of this special assessment notice to inform any subsequent purchasers or owners of the abatement action, costs and assessment.

D. The enforcement official shall record a cancellation of special assessment notice with the Santa Cruz County recorder when either:

1. The responsible person or property owner pays in full the abatement costs; or

2. The Santa Cruz County auditor or tax collector posts a lien on the property pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5.

E. Pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 38773.5 the Santa Cruz County tax collector may collect the amount of a special assessment at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary property taxes and impose the same penalties and procedures, including the sale of the property, in case of delinquency, as provided for with ordinary property tax collection. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of property taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.24.070 Repayment to code enforcement civil penalties fund.
All monies recovered by payment of the charge or assessment or from the sale or transfer of the property shall be remitted to the city finance director who shall credit the appropriate amount to the code enforcement civil penalties fund provided for in Chapter 4.28 or, alternatively, use the monies to reimburse the department responsible for the subject code enforcement action where appropriate.

The city council further finds that the recovery of attorneys’ fees in nuisance abatement actions and proceedings will further the strong public policy of encouraging the abatement of public nuisances in the city, will facilitate the city’s efforts to maintain effective and efficient nuisance abatement programs within the city and will, accordingly, serve as an effective deterrent to the maintenance of public nuisances.

Pursuant to California Government Code Section 38773.5, or its successor statutes, in any action, administrative proceeding or special proceeding to abate a public nuisance wherein the city elects at the initiation of the action or proceeding to seek recovery of its attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the amount of its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in the action or proceeding.

B. The city council further finds that the assessment of a reinspection fee is an appropriate method to recover costs incurred for additional inspections made by enforcement officials and other city personnel. The assessment and collection of reinspection fees shall not preclude the imposition of any administrative or judicial penalties or fines for violations of this code or applicable state codes. (Ord. 852 § 2, 2003)

4.26.030 Authorization.

B. If any case where a business tax is believed by a taxpayer to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, the taxpayer may apply to the administrator for an adjustment of the tax. It shall be the taxpayer’s obligation to request in writing for an adjustment within one year after the date of payment of the tax.

C. The taxpayer shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show the method of business and the gross volume of business and such other information as the administrator may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The administrator shall then conduct an investigation, and shall fix as the tax for the taxpayer an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the tax so fixed. In fixing the tax to be charged, the administrator shall have the power to base the tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the tax as prescribed by this chapter.

D. Should the administrator determine the gross receipt measure of tax to be the proper basis, the administrator may require the taxpayer to submit a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of tax as determined by the administrator. (Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

B. It shall be the duty of every person liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least four years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

5.07.230 Lien – Recordation. Revised 1/19
If any amount required to be paid to the city under the ordinance codified in this chapter is not paid when due, the administrator, upon expiration of the second delinquency period referenced in Section 5.07.120(A)(2), may, within four years after the amount is due, record in the office(s) of the county recorder(s) of any county in the state of California a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address of the operator liable for the same and the fact that the administrator has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the recording, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest shall constitute a lien upon any and all real property in any county owned by the operator or thereafter acquired by the operator. The lien shall have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. (Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

5.07.240 Warrant for collection of tax. Revised 1/19
At any time within four years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount herein required to be paid off after the last recording of a certificate of lien under Section 5.07.230, the administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution.

(Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

5.07.250 Seizure and sale. Revised 1/19
At any time within four years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the administrator may forthwith collect the amount in the following manner: The administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale.

(Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

5.07.260 Successor’s and assignee’s responsibility. Revised 1/19
If any operator, while liable for any amount under this chapter, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers the business, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the operator’s subsequent successor, assign or other transferee, or other person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the business, shall satisfy any tax liability owed to the city associated with the business. Failure to do so for the benefit of the city will result in being personally liable to the city for the full amount of the tax liability, which includes interest and penalties.

The successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity seeking to obtain ownership or control of the business shall notify the administrator of the date of transfer at least thirty days prior to the transfer date; or, if the agreement to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the business was made less than thirty days prior to the date of transfer, notice shall be provided immediately.

The successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity who obtains ownership or control of the business shall be deemed to have complied with the requirement of this section to satisfy the unpaid tax liability if that person or entity has requested and received a “tax clearance certificate” from the administrator showing that it has been paid and stating that no amount is due through the date of transfer. The issuance of such a tax clearance certificate shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5, as applicable to transient occupancy taxes.

The administrator, within ninety days of receiving a written request from a successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity who obtains or attempts to obtain ownership or control of the business, may issue a tax clearance certificate stating either the amount of tax liability due and owing for the property, or stating that there is no tax liability due and owing for the property. The administrator may also request financial records from the current or former owner or operator to conduct an audit of the tax that may be due and owing. After completing the audit within ninety days after the date that the records were made available, the administrator may issue a tax clearance certificate within thirty days of completing the audit, stating the amount of the tax liability owed, if any. If the city determines that the records provided for an audit are insufficient, the administrator may rely on the facts and information available to estimate any tax liability associated with the property. The administrator may issue a tax clearance certificate stating the amount of the tax liability, if any, based on such facts and information available. A written application for a hearing on the amount assessed on the tax clearance certificate must be made within ten days after the serving or mailing of the certificate. The hearing provision of Section 5.07.300 shall apply. If an application for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax clearance certificate shall serve as conclusive evidence of the tax liability associated with the property as of the date specified on the certificate. (Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

5.07.270 Deficiency determinations. Revised 1/19
If the administrator is not satisfied that any statement filed as required under the provisions of this chapter is correct, or that the amount of tax is correctly computed, he or she may compute and determine the amount to be paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained in the statement or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession within three years of the date the tax was originally due and payable. One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person discontinues engaging in a business, a deficiency determination may be made at any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, a notice shall be given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under Sections 5.07.280 through 5.07.300. (Ord. 1023 § 1 (part), 2018)

To the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute, or interpretation thereof, shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not require voter approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute, or new interpretation thereof, shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent.

Alarm system permits for residential buildings are encouraged, but are not required by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any police response to alarm devices. The issuance of an alarm permit does not entitle the holder to any special level of police service to an alarm device. (Ord. 905 § 1, 2006)

5.24.005 Findings. Revised 8/18
The city council finds as follows:

A. Entertainment often produces noise which is obtrusive to persons not patronizing the business or activity which produces the noise.

B. The availability of entertainment is often a significant factor in attracting patrons who infringe upon the peace and quiet and nightly sleep of nonpatrons, and is exacerbated by any of the following:

1. The entertainment is offered in conjunction with the distribution of alcohol.

2. The entertainment is offered by businesses which are open after nine p.m. and do not, like theaters, have fixed beginning and ending times at which most of the patrons enter and exit.

3. The entertainment is offered in an area where there is a concentration of similar businesses, thereby resulting in the area becoming an after-hours draw and the patrons of those businesses frequently entering and exiting the other establishments.

4. The entertainment is offered in locations where many of the patrons, when leaving, pass through or near areas where people reside.

C. To protect the peace and quiet of nonpatrons and their nightly ability to sleep it is necessary to have a licensing system and to thereby limit and condition the establishments offering such entertainment.

D. Policing and monitoring entertainment licenses entails considerable expense to the city, such that it is appropriate to collect a portion of such expenses from the entities providing the entertainment. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.010 Entertainment defined. Revised 8/18
“Entertainment,” as used in this chapter, means and includes:

A. A performance by live entertainers for the purpose of entertaining the patrons of a business; or

B. Playing recorded music, whether with or without video, for the specific purpose of entertaining the patrons, invitees or visitors of a business, commercial establishment or meeting facility.

“Entertainment,” as used in this chapter, does not include a speech, pantomime or enactment (whether live or recorded), the primary purpose of which is to convey ideas of a political or religious nature, or to explain or critique the activities of public figures or of governmental or other institutions. It does not include mere background (“Muzak”) music played at moderate levels. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 745 § 2, 1992; Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.020 Entertainment permit required. Revised 8/18
No owner, manager or operator of any business or establishment (except theaters, as defined in Section 5.24.025) may arrange for or allow entertainment to be conducted on the premises of any such business or establishment without obtaining an entertainment permit as provided in this chapter. No person shall arrange for or promote entertainment on any publicly owned park, street or facility without first obtaining an entertainment permit as provided in this chapter. However, entertainment which is entirely enclosed within a structure and which cannot, at any time, be audible outside of that structure, need not have any entertainment permit. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.025 Theater defined. Revised 8/18
“Theater,” for purposes of this chapter, means an establishment:

A. Whose primary activity is showing movies or staging theatrical productions which have fixed beginning and ending times; and

B. Primarily offer food or drinks only to those attending the movie of theatrical event. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.030 Permit classifications. Revised 8/18
Entertainment permits shall be classified as follows:

A. A single-event entertainment permit may be issued for activities that will all occur within a single seven-day period.

B. A minor entertainment permit is for a business which offers entertainment incidental to the primary business, does not qualify for a single-event permit, and which has no dance floor or elevated state and which never has a cover charge.

C. A regular entertainment permit is for businesses which offer entertainment, but which do not qualify for a single-event entertainment permit or a minor entertainment permit. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.040 Permit issuance. Revised 8/18
A. The city council shall issue new regular entertainment permits.

B. The city manager or department head designee may issue recurring regular entertainment permits, single-event entertainment permits and minor entertainment permits. The city manager, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may refer any single-event entertainment permit application, recurring regular entertainment permit, or minor entertainment permit application to the city council for its consideration.

C. Entertainment permits may be issued as herein provided for upon the city council’s or city manager’s finding that:

1. No significant number of nonpatrons will be disturbed by the entertainment, which is the subject of the permit application or, by the goings and comings of the people patronizing the entertainment events, which are the subject of the permit application;

2. The establishment at which the entertainment is to be provided or the entity which is applying for the entertainment permit is currently in compliance with all applicable state and local building, zoning, fire, and other regulations pertaining to public health and safety as well as any other statutes, ordinances, regulations, or permits that pertain to the establishment or the property on which the establishment is situated.

D. When necessary to assure that the entertainment which is the subject of the permit application will not result in disturbance to nonpatrons, the city council or city manager may condition the permit to assure nondisturbance by imposing permit-specific conditions relating to, but not limited to, days of operation, hours of operation, best practices to minimize public safety issues, noise level limitations, noise reduction and other, similar measures. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 855 § 1, 2003; Ord. 835 § 2, 2002)

5.24.045 Appeals. Revised 8/18
A permit applicant whose application for a single event entertainment permit, recurring regular entertainment permits or minor entertainment permit is denied by the city manager, or who is dissatisfied with the conditions imposed upon the permit issued by the city manager, may appeal to the city council in accordance with Chapter 2.52 of this code. The city council’s decision with regard to the issuance and conditions of new regular entertainment permits and the city council’s decision on appeal or city manager referral with regard to single-event or minor entertainment permits shall be final. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 835 § 2, 2002)

5.24.050 Duration of permits. Revised 8/18
The operative period of time for a single-event entertainment permit shall be set forth in the permit itself. All other permits shall expire no later than one year from the date of issuance. The issuance of a permit for one year does not establish a vested right to a renewal of the permit. If, during any permit period, the nature of the business activity or the circumstances surrounding the event to which the permit pertains change from the way it was initially permitted, the city in its sole discretion may require any permit holder to immediately apply for a new permit.

5.24.060 Revocation or nonrenewal. Revised 8/18

5.24.070 Fees. Revised 8/18
The city council may establish fees for applications for any of the permits described in Section 5.24.030 of this chapter. It may also prescribe fees for the issuance of the permit itself. Any schedule or formula of permit fees may be based on reasonable estimations of the cost to the city of monitoring or enforcing permit compliance. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.080 Application forms. Revised 8/18
The city manager may develop application forms pertinent to this chapter. Applicants may be required to submit any nonprivileged information reasonably related to the concerns expressed in Section 5.24.005. (Ord. 1020 § 1 (part), 2018: Ord. 699 (part), 1990)

5.24.090 Violations. Revised 8/18
The operation of any business or entertainment activity contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a nuisance subject to abatement as provided in Title 4 of this code.

Proposition 64, approved by the voters of California in November 2016, legalized the adult recreational use of cannabis. This chapter is designed to regulate the sale of cannabis based upon the new state law.

The city has determined to initially limit the number of cannabis retail outlets allowed to ensure that this use will not create unforeseen impacts. To provide a process that limits the number of retail establishments without tying those establishments to specific properties, this chapter creates a licensing structure for cannabis retail businesses. (Ord. 1021 § 1 (part), 2018)

5.36.020 Definitions. Revised 1/19

a. License Transfer to New Owner. No licensee shall transfer ownership or control of a retail cannabis establishment to another person or entity unless and until the transferee obtains an amendment to the license from the chief of police stating that the transferee is now the licensee. Such an amendment may be obtained only if the transferee files all required application materials in accordance with all provisions of this chapter, pays all applicable fees, passes the background check, and independently meets the requirements of the cannabis retail license, as determined by the chief of police. A license shall not be transferred to an owner that has engaged in unlawful, fraudulent, unfair, or deceptive business acts or practices.

b. Changes in ownership of a licensee’s business structure or a substantial change in the ownership of a licensee’s business entity (changes that result in a change of more than fifty-one percent of the original ownership) must be approved by the city manager or his/her designee through the transfer process contained in subsection (A)(9)(a) of this section. Failure to comply with this provision is grounds for license revocation.

c. A licensee may change the form of business entity without applying to the city manager or his/her designee for a transfer of license; provided, that either:

i. The membership of the new business entity is substantially similar to the original license holder business entity (at least fifty-one percent of the membership is identical); or

ii. If the original licensee is an unincorporated association, mutual or public benefit corporation, agricultural or consumer cooperative corporation and subsequently transitions to or forms a new business entity as allowed under the MAUCRSA and to comply with this section; provided, that the board of directors (or in the case of an unincorporated association, the individual(s) listed on the city retail cannabis license application) of the original retail cannabis licensed entity are the same as the new business entity.

Although a transfer is not required in these two circumstances, the license holder is required to notify the chief of police in writing of the change within ten days of the change. Failure to comply with this provision is grounds for license revocation.

d. No retail cannabis license may be transferred when the chief of police has notified the licensee that the license has been or may be suspended or revoked.

e. Any attempt to transfer a retail cannabis license either directly or indirectly in violation of this section is hereby declared void, and such a purported transfer shall be deemed a ground for revocation of the license.

10. License Transfer to New Location. A cannabis retailer license does not run with the property. Licensees may change locations contingent upon obtaining a letter of referral from the city’s chief of police, a conditional use permit for the new location, and approval from the state licensing agency for the new location.

ii. Written Notice. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a license shall be revoked or suspended by the chief of police under the authority of this section in a written notice. Such revocation or suspension notice shall state the specific reasons for the proposed suspension or revocation.

14. Appeal of Decision. An applicant or interested party aggrieved by any decision to approve, suspend, modify, or revoke a license under this chapter may appeal such decision to the city council by filing a written appeal in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 2.52 (Appeals to City Council).

8.07.110    Preemption.

8.07.010 Purpose and findings.
A. It is the intent of the city of Capitola, in enacting this chapter, to eliminate the common use of plastic single-use carryout bags, encourage the use of reusable bags by consumers and retailers, and to reduce the consumption of single-use bags in general.

B. Whereas the city of Capitola has an obligation to protect the environment, the economy, and public health. The city of Capitola has a seventy-five percent waste reduction goal, which is to be reached by waste reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting. The city of Capitola makes the following findings:

1. The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) estimates that Californians use nearly twenty billion single-use plastic bags per year and discard over one hundred plastic bags per second. Further the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only five percent of the plastic bags in California and nationwide are currently recycled.

2. According to Save Our Shores, a Santa Cruz based marine conservation non-profit that conducts beach, river, and inland cleanups in the coastal regions of Santa Cruz, San Mateo, and Monterey Counties, from June 2007 to May 2011, over four hundred cleanups were conducted where volunteers removed a total of twenty-six thousand plastic bags. Unchecked, this material would have likely entered the marine environment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

3. Plastic bags returned to supermarkets may be recycled into plastic lumber; however, a very low percentage of bags are actually returned. Recycling bags into lumber does not reduce the impact of making new plastic carryout bags. The CalRecycle 2009 Statewide Recycling Rate for Plastic Carryout Bags report indicates that of the fifty-two thousand seven hundred sixty-five tons of regulated bags purchased statewide, only one thousand five hundred twenty tons were collected for recycling, a recycling rate of about three percent.

4. The city of Capitola currently has a plastic bag recycling component to the residential curbside recycling program.

5. Improperly prepared plastic bags create equipment problems at the material recovery facility. Loose bags wrap around the bearings and shafts of the material separator. The equipment must be stopped and the bags removed before they cause permanent damage. This results in slower production times for the sorting crew, as well as increased processing and repair costs.

6. Compostable plastic carryout bags, as currently manufactured, do not solve the problems of wildlife damage, litter, or resource use addressed by this chapter. Compostable carryout bags are designed to remain intact until placed in a professional compost facility, so they do not degrade quickly as litter or in a marine environment. Producing compostable bags consumes nearly as much fossil fuel as noncompostable bags. Mixing compostable bags with regular plastic bags prevents recycling or composting either of them. Therefore, there is no exemption in this chapter for compostable carryout bags.

7. Reusable bags are readily available from numerous sources and vendors. Many grocery and other retail establishments throughout the city of Capitola already offer reusable bags for sale at a price as low as one dollar.

8. Even though paper bags are recycled at a much higher rate within the city of Capitola than plastic bags, the purpose of this chapter is to reduce all single-use bags. For this reason, a charge on paper bags is indicated as an incentive to reduce their use and encourage reusable bags.

9. Paper bags that contain a minimum of forty percent post-consumer recycled content have fewer negative impacts than virgin paper bags. Paper shopping bags with forty percent post-consumer recycled content are easily available, and such bags are in wide use by Capitola merchants.

10. Many California cities have adopted or are pursuing a ban as the most effective means to eliminate the impacts these plastic bags cause. State law does not prohibit jurisdictions from placing fees on plastic or paper bags. (Ord. 995 § 1 (part), 2014; Ord. 977 § 1, 2013)

8.07.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:

A. “Carryout bags” means bags provided by retailers to customers at the point of sale to hold customers’ purchases. “Carryout bags” do not include bags used to contain loose items prior to checkout, such as meat, produce, and bulk goods, and does not include prepackaged products.

B. “Single-use plastic bag” or “single-use plastic carryout bag” means a single-use carryout bag of any size that is made from plastic and provided at the point of sale to customers by a retail establishment. Single-use plastic bags include both compostable and noncompostable carryout bags.

C. “Single-use paper bag” means a checkout bag provided by a retail establishment at the point of sale that is made from paper and is not a reusable bag.

D. “Recyclable” means material that can be sorted, cleansed, and reconstituted using the city’s available recycling collection programs for the purpose of using the altered form in the manufacture of a new product. Recycling does not include burning, incinerating, converting, or otherwise destroying solid waste.

E. “Reusable bag” means any bag with handles that is specifically designed and manufactured for multiple reuse, and meets the following requirements: (1) is either made of cloth or other washable woven fabric, or made of durable material including plastic that is at least four mils thick; and (2) does not contain lead, cadmium, or any other heavy metal in toxic amounts. A reusable bag may be made of recyclable plastic such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), or polypropylene.

F. “Retail establishment” or “retail store” means all sales outlets, stores, shops, restaurants, vehicles, or other places of business located within the city of Capitola, which operate primarily to sell or convey goods, directly to the ultimate consumer.

G. “Restaurants” means an establishment whose principal business is the sale of prepared food for consumption either on- or off-premises, are not covered under this chapter.

H. “Exempted uses” means those point-of-purchase or delivery sales, which have received a special exemption through the city manager or designee, that allows the use of single-use bags. (Ord. 995 § 1 (part), 2014; Ord. 977 § 1, 2013)

8.07.030 Ban on plastic bags and store charge for single-use paper carryout bags.
A. No retail establishment shall provide plastic carryout bags to customers at the point of sale, except as permitted in this chapter.

The city council shall review the charge amount one year from the date of adoption to judge its effectiveness and at any time thereafter as the city council deems necessary. Notice of such fee shall be displayed in retail establishments at a prominent location.

E. The charge imposed pursuant to this section shall not be applied to customers participating in the California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the State Department of Social Services Food Stamp program, or other government subsidized purchase programs for low-income residents.

F. The ban on single-use plastic bags and the charge on single-use paper bags shall not apply to restaurants, or to bags that are integral to the packaging of the product, or bags without handles provided to the customer: (1) to transport produce, bulk food, pharmacy products or meat from a department within a retail store to the point of sale; or (2) to segregate food merchandise that could damage or contaminate other food or merchandise when placed together in a reusable bag or single-use paper bag.

G. Retail establishments are strongly encouraged to make reusable bags available for sale to customers at a reasonable price.

H. Retail establishments shall indicate on the customer transaction receipt the number of carryout bags provided, and the total amount charged for those bags. (Ord. 977 § 1, 2013)

8.07.040 Implementation.
A. Sixty days before the ordinance codified in this chapter takes effect, the city of Capitola shall post, mail or deliver a copy of it to retail establishments within the city limits of the city of Capitola.

B. The city of Capitola will distribute to each store a reproducible placard designed to inform shoppers of the city of Capitola policy for carryout bags.

8.24.100 Permit – Expiration.
The permittee shall complete the work authorized by the permit within the time and before the date set out in the permit. If there have been exceptional circumstances, the city may grant the applicant an extension. Upon the expiration of the permit, no further work shall be done unless and until the applicant has received an extension or a new permit. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.110 Permit – Suspension and revocation.
A. Circumstances for Such Action. The city may suspend or revoke any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, whenever it finds that the permittee has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, or has misrepresented any material fact in his or her application, or any supporting documents, for such a permit. Prior to ordering any such suspension or revocation, the city shall give the permittee an opportunity for a hearing thereon, after reasonable notice. The hearing shall be before the city head or his or her designated representative. An appeal may be made as set forth below.

B. Consequences. No person whose permit has been suspended or revoked shall continue to perform the work for which the permit was granted until, in the case of suspension, such permit has been reinstated by the city.

C. Ordered Additional Work. Upon suspending or revoking any permit, the city may order the permittee to perform any work reasonably necessary to protect the underground waters from pollution or contamination, if any work already done by the permittee has left a well in such condition as to constitute a hazard to the quality of the underground waters. No permittee or person who has held any permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall fail to comply with an such order. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.120 Well standards.
Except as otherwise specified, the standards for the construction, repair, reconstruction, or destruction of wells shall be as set forth in the California Department of Water Resources Bulletin 74-81 “Water Well Standards, State of California” except as modified by subsequent revisions by the Department of Water Resources. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.130 Variances.
The city shall have the power under the following specified conditions to grant a variance from any provision of the standards referenced above and to prescribe alternative requirements in their place.

A. There must be, in a specific case, a special circumstance where practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship would result from the strict interpretation and enforcement of any standard.

B. The granting of such a variance must be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.140 Soquel Creek service area restrictions.
A. Findings. The city council finds and determines that:

1. Several reports have been prepared which indicate the potential for seawater intrusion into the Purisima Formation in the Soquel-Aptos groundwater basin; and

2. There is need for careful monitoring and management of the groundwater basin; and

3. Careful management is greatly facilitated by restricting the number of new wells and requiring that new development be supplied by Soquel Creek county water district, a public agency empowered to carry out monitoring and management efforts; and

4. Construction of new wells within the water district service area increase the potential public health hazard of cross-connections between private and public water systems;

5. Development should be served by a public water system.

B. Well Construction Within the Soquel Creek County Water District Service Area. The construction of new wells shall be prohibited on parcels that are both within the area designated as the “Soquel-Aptos Groundwater Basin: (as adopted by separate board Resolution 233-81) and within two hundred feet of a water distribution line of the Soquel Creek county water district.

C. New Well Construction – Exceptions. The following new well construction shall not be subject to the prohibition of this section:

1. Replacement of existing wells;

2. Well construction pursuant to valid well drilling permit issued on or before April 6, 1981;

3. Construction of a well for agricultural use, monitoring and observations purposes, or cathodic protection; and

4. Well construction on parcels which cannot be served by the Soquel Creek county water district, as determined by the community development director based on a written statement from the district clearly outlining their inability to provide the service. (Ord. 688 § 1, 1990; Ord. 635 § 1, 1987)

8.24.150 Other special groundwater protection.
The city may designate areas where groundwater quality problems are known to exist and where a well will penetrate more than one aquifer. The city may require in these designated areas special well seal(s) to prevent mixing of water from several aquifers. Where an applicant proposes well construction, reconstruction, or destruction work in such an area, the city may require the applicant to provide a report prepared by a registered geologist or registered civil engineer (California Business and Professions Code Sections 7850 and 6762 respectively) that identifies all strata containing poor quality water and recommends the location and specifications of the seal or seals needed to prevent the entrance of poor quality water or its migration into other aquifers. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.160 Inspections.
The health officer shall make an inspection of the annular seal construction work. The health officer may make an initial inspection of each proposed drilling site, an inspection at the completion of the work, and inspections at such other times as it deems appropriate. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.170 Initial inspection.
Upon receipt of an application, the city may make an inspection of the drilling site prior to the issuance of a well permit. The purpose of, this inspection is to determine whether there are any site conditions such that the city shall do the following:

A. Require relocation of the drilling site should the location shown on the permit application be too close to potential sources of pollution;

B. Set additional conditions if needed to remediate any previously unknown groundwater quality protection problems. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.180 Inspection of well seal.
The health officer shall inspect the annular space grout depth prior to the sealing.

A. Required Notice. The health officer shall be notified by the well driller a minimum of twenty-four hours prior to sealing the annular space. Drillers who anticipate completing a well in less than one day shall notify the city twenty-four hours prior to commencement of drilling and provide the anticipated time to commence the sealing of the annular space.

B. Should Health Officer Fail to be Present. If the city wishes to allow a seal to be tremied or placed without inspection, the driller shall seal the well in accordance with the standards of this chapter and any permit conditions. No seal shall be tremied or placed until permission to proceed is given. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.190 Final inspection.
If requested by the city, the driller shall notify the health officer within seven days of the completion of its work at each drilling site. The health officer may make a final inspection after completion of the work to determine whether the well was completed in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.200 Waiver of inspections.
The health officer may waive inspections should any of the following conditions exist:

A. Inspections may be waived where the work will be inspected by the staff of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board or the California Department of Health Services if these designated agencies will inspect and report to the city on all drilling features required by the standards.

B. Inspections may be waived for monitoring wells that will penetrate only aquifers containing degraded waters or will penetrate only formations that normally contain no water.

C. Initial inspections may be waived when the drilling site is well known to the city staff and it is known that no significant threats to groundwater quality exist in the area. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.210 Completion reports.
The driller shall provide the health officer a completion report within thirty days of the completion of any well construction, reconstruction, or destruction job. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.220 Submittal of state “report of completion”.
A copy of the “report of completion” (Water Well Driller’s Report, Department of Water Resources Form 188) required by California Water Code Section 13751 shall be submitted by the permittee to the health officer within thirty days of construction, alteration, or destruction of any well. This report shall document that the work was completed in accordance with the standards and all additional permit conditions. This section shall not be deemed to release any person from the requirement to file said report with the state Department of Water Resources. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.230 Confidentiality of report.
In accordance with California Water Code Section 13752, reports shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available for inspection by governmental agencies for use in making studies. Reports shall be made available to any person who obtains written authorization from the owner of the well. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.240 Other agency’s requirements.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to excuse any person from compliance with the provisions of California Water Code Sections 13750 through 13755 relating to notices and reports of completion or any other federal, state or local reporting regulations. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.250 Right of appeal.
Any person whose application for a permit has been denied, or granted conditionally, or whose permit has been suspended or revoked, or whose variance request has been denied, may appeal to the council, in writing, within ten days after any such denial, conditional granting, suspension, or revocation. Such appeal shall specify the grounds upon which it is taken, and shall be accompanied by filing fee as set forth herein. The city clerk shall set such appeal for hearing at the earliest practicable time, and shall notify the appellant and the council, in writing, of the time so set at least five days prior to the hearing. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

After such hearing, which shall be de novo, the council may reverse, wholly or partly, or may modify the order or determination appealed from. Regarding findings, see Section 2.52.060. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.270 Right of entry and inspection.
Representatives of the city shall have the right to enter upon any premises at all reasonable times to make inspections and tests for the purpose of such enforcement and administration. If any such premises are occupied, the representative shall first present proper credentials and demand entry. If the same is unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of same and demand entry. If such entry is refused, he or she shall have recourse to such remedies as are provided by law to secure entry. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.280 Destruction of abandoned wells.
All persons owning an abandoned well as defined in the well standards shall destroy it before December 31, 1991, except those excluded by California Health and Safety Code Section 24440. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.24.290 Violation – Penalty.
Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter may be prosecuted as provided in Section 1.01.090 and Title 4 of this code. (Ord. 955 § 5, 2011; Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

Whenever the city determines that a well: (1) has not been completed in accordance with a well permit or the plans and specifications relating thereto; (2) has been constructed without the required permit; or (3) an abandoned well has not been destroyed in accordance with the standards, the city may record a notice of violation with the office of the county recorder. The owner(s) of the property, as revealed by the assessment roll, on which the violation is situated and any other person responsible for the violation shall be notified of the recordation, if their address is available.

If the property owner(s) or authorized agent disagree with the determination, he or she may submit evidence to the city indicating that there is no violation and then shall have a right to appeal an adverse decision to the council in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2.52.

B. Removal of Violation Notice. The city shall submit a removal of notice of violation to the county recorder when: (1) it is determined by the health officer or the council, after review, that no violation of this chapter exists; or (2) all required and corrective work has been completed and approved by the city. (Ord. 688 § 2, 1990)

8.34.010 Adoption.
Pursuant to Section 15050, Title 14 of the California Administrative Code, the city of Capitola hereby adopts by reference the State CEQA Guidelines (Title 14 of the California Administrative Code, Section 15000 et seq.). In case of conflict between the State CEQA Guidelines and this chapter, the State CEQA Guidelines shall prevail. The purpose of the procedures set forth in this chapter are, in the words of State CEQA Guideline Section 15050(f) “... to tailor the general provisions of the guidelines to the specific operations of the agency.” (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.020 Administration.
A. The city manager or designated representative shall be the administrator of environmental quality, hereafter referred to as “administrator.” He or she shall perform those duties that are enumerated for the administrator in these procedures. The administrator shall have those functions listed in State CEQA Guideline Section 15055(a), namely:

1. Determination of whether a project is exempt;

2. Conduct of an initial study;

3. Preparation of a negative declaration or EIR;

4. Determination that a negative declaration has been completed within a period of one hundred five days;

5. Preparation of responses to public comments;

6. Certification that the decision-making body has reviewed and considered an EIR or negative declaration;

7. Filing of notices.

B. The city’s decision-making body for a particular project (the body which has the authority to finally approve or disapprove the project) shall perform the following functions:

1. Review and consideration of a final EIR or negative declaration prior to approving a project;

2. The making of findings as required by State CEQA Guideline Sections 15088 and 15089.

C. Where an advisory body such as the planning commission is required to make a recommendation on a project to the decision-making body, the advisory body shall also review and consider the EIR or negative declaration. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.030 Fees.
The administrator shall charge and receive such fees, costs, and charges for services required herein as shall be set by resolution of the city council. Actual cost of EIR preparation shall be paid by nongovernmental applicants. When the city contracts with consultants to prepare an EIR for a private project, the city will consult with the applicant in the process of negotiating the consultant’s contractual fee. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.040 Environmental document preparation.
The responsibility for preparation of environmental documents shall be as follows:

A. Projects Carried Out by the City. When the city plans to carry out a project which is subject to CEQA, the environmental documents for the project shall be prepared directly by, or under contract to, the city and the administrator shall direct the preparation of such documents.

B. Projects Carried Out by Persons Other Than City. Where a project which is subject to CEQA is to be carried out by a person or organization other than a city agency, subject to the approval, financial support, or some other involvement by the city, the environmental documents shall be prepared directly by, or under contract to, the city.

The administrator shall direct the preparation of such documents. However, the city may require the person to supply data and information, both to determine whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment and to assist in the preparation of an EIR or negative declaration by the city. The administrator may require or permit this information to be submitted in the form of a draft EIR. If information is provided in the form of a draft EIR or initial study, the city may not use the document as its own without independent evaluation and analysis. The draft EIR or negative declaration which is sent out for public review must reflect the independent judgment of the administrator and his or her staff.

C. Responsibility for Review of EIRs Received from Other Public Agencies. All such EIRs received by the city shall be referred to the administrator, who shall develop procedures for their review consistent with guideline requirements. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.050 Time limits and public notice.
In addition to the time limits and public notice requirements of State CEQA Guidelines, public notice for negative declarations should be given at the time of the notice of project review or at least seven days before decision on the project. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.060 Summary of the procedure.
Sections 8.34.070 through 8.34.160 provide a brief summary of environmental review procedure to enable the reader of the municipal code to gain a general idea of that process without having to make a detailed reading of the State CEQA Guidelines. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.070 Environmental review requirements.
Every project proposed to be carried out, funded, or approved by the city is subject to environmental review as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.080 Submission and filing of project proposals and applications.
Every application for project approval shall be submitted to the administrator for environmental review. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.090 Lead agency determination.
After receiving such application or proposal, the administrator shall first determine whether the city is the lead agency according to State CEQA Guidelines. In most cases, the city will be the lead agency. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.100 Environmental review where city is not lead agency.
In cases where the city is a responsible agency with respect to a certain project, but not the lead agency, the city shall comply with all other requirements imposed upon responsible agencies by CEQA or the State CEQA Guidelines. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.110 Environmental questionnaire.
A. Requirement. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the applicant or the city agency making a proposal for a project to be carried out, funded, or approved by the city, where the city is the lead agency, shall submit a completed environmental questionnaire to the administrator.

B. Exception. An environmental questionnaire shall not be required for ministerial projects or for projects where the administrator can determine, on the basis of the application or proposal alone, that the project is clearly exempt from the requirements of CEQA. In these cases, no further review shall be required for the project, unless changed circumstances occur which require environmental review. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.120 Exemptions.

In response to the mandate of Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code, the secretary for resources has found that certain classes of projects do not have a significant effect on the environment and has declared them to be categorically exempt from the requirements for the preparation of environmental documents. Those classes of projects are listed in Article 19 of the State CEQA Guidelines and are adopted by the city by reference. If the administrator determines that a project is not a ministerial project he or she shall then determine whether the project comes within one of the categorical exemptions. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.220 Exceptions to categorical exemptions.
A. Location. Class 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located, a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may have an impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state or local agencies.

B. Cumulative Impact. The categorical exemptions for all classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive project of the same type in the same place is significant, for example, annual additions to an existing building under Class I. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.230 Feasibility and planning studies.

The object will be to cause the least possible conflict with other uses and activities while making full and proper provision for preservation of environmental qualities. Other city departments should give environmental needs equal consideration.

Respective departments which have authority to issue permits for private projects and authority to carry out public projects shall work with the administrator in the preparation of environmental documents on such projects. The administrator shall consult with the respective departments during the preparation of environmental documents, and shall review the appropriate environmental documents when they have been completed.

C. Whenever the authority of one decision-making body as to whether to approve or disapprove a project is appealable to another city decision-making body, all CEQA decisions made by the initial decision-making body shall also be appealable in the manner set forth in Chapter 2.56. (Ord. 555 § 2, 1984)

8.34.320 Validity of actions.

8.36.010 Findings and intent.
The city council finds and declares:

A. The city has a duty to protect the natural environment, the economy, and the health of its citizens.

B. Effective ways to reduce the negative environmental impacts of throw-away food service ware include reusing food service ware and using compostable and biodegradable take-out materials made from renewable resources such as paper, corn starch and sugarcane.

C. Polystyrene foam is a common environmental pollutant as well as a nonbiodegradable substance that is commonly used as food service ware by food vendors operating in the city.

D. There continues to be no meaningful recycling of polystyrene foam food service ware and biodegradable or compostable food service ware is an affordable, safe, more ecologically sound alternative.

E. Affordable biodegradable or compostable food service ware products are increasingly available for several food service applications such as cold cups, plates and hinge containers and these products are more ecologically sound than polystyrene foam materials and can be turned into a compost product.

F. New Leaf Markets, Grinds Coffee Shop, and other Capitola businesses have successfully eliminated the use of polystyrene and nonbiodegradable packaging materials in the operation of their businesses.

G. The Oakland Coliseum has successfully replaced its cups with biodegradable cornstarch cups and has shown an overall cost savings due to organics recycling.

H. Over one hundred fifty-five businesses in Oakland engage in organics recycling and it has been demonstrated that the use of biodegradable or compostable food service ware can reduce waste disposal costs when the products are taken to composting facilities as part of an organics recycling program rather than disposed in a landfill.

I. The natural compost product from these biodegradable or compostable materials is used as fertilizer for farms and gardens, thereby moving towards a healthier zero waste system.

J. Disposable food service ware constitutes a large portion of the litter in Capitola’s lagoon, waterways and storm drains, and on the beaches, streets, parks and public places and the cost of managing this litter is high and rising.

K. Polystyrene foam is notorious as a pollutant that breaks down into smaller, nonbiodegradable pieces that are ingested by marine life and other wildlife thus harming or killing them.

L. Due to the physical properties of polystyrene, the EPA states “that such materials can also have serious impacts on human health, wildlife, the aquatic environment and the economy.”

M. A 1986 EPA report on solid waste named the polystyrene manufacturing process as the fifth largest creator of hazardous waste in the United States.

N. In the product manufacturing process as well as the use and disposal of the products, the energy consumption, greenhouse gas effect, and total environmental effect, polystyrene’s environmental impacts were second highest, behind aluminum, according to the California Integrated Waste Management Board.

O. Styrene, a component of polystyrene, is a known hazardous substance that medical evidence and the Food and Drug Administration suggests leaches from polystyrene containers into food and drink.

P. Styrene is a suspected carcinogen and neurotoxin which potentially threatens human health.

Q. Styrene has been detected in the fat tissue of every man, woman and child tested by the EPA in a 1986 study.

R. The general public is not typically warned of any potential hazard, particularly in the immigrant and non-English-speaking community.

S. Due to these concerns nearly one hundred cities have banned polystyrene foam food service ware including several California cities, and many local businesses and several national corporations have successfully replaced polystyrene foam and other nonbiodegradable food service ware with affordable, safe, biodegradable products.

T. Restricting polystyrene foam products that are not wholly encapsulated or encased by a more durable material and replacing non-biodegradable food service ware with biodegradable food service ware products in Capitola will further protect the public health and safety of the residents of Capitola, the city of Capitola’s natural environment, waterways and wildlife, would advance the city’s goal of developing a sustainable city, advance the city’s goal of zero waste by 2020 and fulfill Article 10 of the Environmental Accords, whereby Capitola partnered with other cities across the globe in signing a commitment to eliminate or restrict the use of one chemical or environmental hazard every year. (Ord. 964 § 1, 2011; Ord. 913 § 2, 2006)

A. The medical condition described as acquired immune deficiency syndrome and commonly known as AIDS is a life-threatening disease which has the potential to affect every segment of our city’s population.

B. No evidence exists to indicate that the disease is spread through casual contact, such as contact at work or at school, through the air or water or through the handling of food by persons having AIDS or AIDS-related conditions (ARC).

C. Individuals with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions are subject to discrimination because of their medical condition. This discrimination may occur with regard to employment, testing, education, real estate transactions, business establishments, services, accommodations and associations.

D. Such discrimination creates discord and deprives the city of the fullest utilization of its resources and capacity for development and advancement, and may further pose a direct health threat in that it may deter persons from pursuing medically indicated diagnosis and treatment.

E. Such discrimination may pose a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the community, and existing state and federal restraints on arbitrary discrimination are inadequate to meet the particular problems of this city. (Ord. 676 § 1, 1989)

8.54.020 Trip reduction AVR goals.
A. The fundamental AVR goal of this trip reduction ordinance is to achieve a 1.35 overall average vehicle ridership (AVR) by 1998 at employer sites with fifty or more employees.

B. In order to demonstrate achievement of this goal, and conformance with the congestion management plan, the city of Capitola shall monitor, document and make annual findings regarding progress toward meeting the 1998 goal under a voluntary program, and shall implement mandatory program requirements in the event that significant progress is not demonstrated by 1996 or subsequent annual travel survey overall AVR results, as defined in subsection C of this section.

C. The following interim AVR goals are defined for the years leading up to the 1998 timeframe for achievement of the 1.35 overall AVR fundamental goal. Attainment of these interim goals in 1996 and thereafter, as documented by travel survey AVR results, shall constitute significant progress and shall maintain the voluntary status of the program.

8.54.030 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings defined and explained in this section:

“Alternative work schedule” means a work arrangement which causes a full-time employee to commute to the work site less than ten times during a fourteen-day period.

“Average vehicle ridership” (AVR) calculation. AVR for worksites with fifty or more employees shall be calculated by dividing the number of employee days summed over the survey week by the number of vehicle trips summed over the survey week, in accordance with the following provisions:

1. Survey Week. The survey week shall be a five-day, Monday through Friday period which does not contain a holiday, and shall represent a normal situation so that a representative projection of the AVR is obtained.

2. Employee day: each day of the survey week that an employee starts work during the six a.m. to ten a.m. peak period. Note that employees telecommuting or who are off due to a compressed work week schedule are counted toward the total employee days. The following employees are not counted toward the total employee days: (a) employees on vacation, sick leave, jury duty or other time off; and (b) employees reporting to a different worksite or an off-site, work-related activity.

3. Vehicle Trip. A vehicle trip is based on the means of transportation used for the greatest distance of an employee’s home-to-work commute trip for employees who start work during the peak period. Each vehicle trip to the worksite shall be calculated as follows:

a. Single occupant vehicle (drive alone) = 1.

b. Carpool = 1 divided by number of people in carpool, regardless of whether the other person(s) in the carpool work for the employer or at the work site.

c. Vanpool = 1 divided by the number of people in vanpool, regardless of whether the other person(s) in the vanpool work for the employer or at the work site.

d. Motorcycle, moped, motorized scooter, or motor bike = 1.

e. Public transit = 0.

f. Buspool, including buses serving several work sites = 0.

g. Bicycle = 0.

h. Walking and other nonmotorized transportation modes = 0.

i. Telecommuting = 0 on days employee is telecommuting for the entire day.

j. Compressed workweek = 0 on employee’s compressed day(s) off.

k. Zero emission vehicle = 0.

l. Low emission vehicles as approved by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Quality Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) = 0.

4. Calculation Example. An example of calculating weekly AVR for an employer with one hundred employees all reporting to work weekdays between six a.m. and ten a.m. is:

Employees reporting to work:

Monday

100

Tuesday

100

Wednesday

100

Thursday

100

Friday

100

Total

500

Number of vehicles driven to the worksite:

Monday

77

Tuesday

79

Wednesday

72

Thursday

68

Friday

74

Total

370

Worksite AVR is derived from dividing the number of employees reporting to work during the hours of six a.m. to ten a.m. during the week (e.g., 500) by the number of vehicles driven to the work site between the same hours (e.g., 370):

500 employees

=

1.35 Average Vehicle Ridership

370 vehicles

 

Overall AVR shall be calculated by the trip reduction program manager using reported AVR data from travel surveys conducted at participating employment sites.

8.60.010 Graffiti defined.
As used in this chapter, “graffiti” means any form of painting, writing or inscription, regardless of the content or nature of the material used, which is placed upon any structure, fixture or sign in any location where it can be viewed from any public street, walkway, building, park, or facility, and which appears to be unauthorized by the owner or lessee of the property where located. (Ord. 694 (part), 1990)

8.60.020 Graffiti prohibited.
Writing, spraying, scratching or otherwise affixing graffiti is prohibited and is subject to penalties as provided in Municipal Code Section 1.01.090 and Title 4 of this code. If a minor is personally unable to pay any fine levied for violating this chapter, the parent or legal guardian of the minor shall be liable for payment of the fine. A court may waive payment of the fine by the parent or legal guardian upon a finding of good cause. (Ord. 955 § 8, 2011; Ord. 694 (part), 1990)

8.60.030 Graffiti declared a nuisance.
Graffiti is hereby determined to be a nuisance because its continued existence constitutes a visual blight upon the area in which located. (Ord. 694 (part), 1990)

8.60.040 Abatement.
The greatest disincentive to graffiti is its prompt eradication. The best way of minimizing the blight created by graffiti is quick removal of the graffiti.

For those reasons the city manager is authorized to develop procedures whereby public works personnel, or persons under contract with the city, may enter onto private property and remove or paint over the graffiti. Such a program should endeavor to notify affected property owners and allow them to promptly eradicate the graffiti. However, if the property owner(s) cannot be promptly contacted within twenty-four hours of the first attempted notification or cannot or will not immediately eradicate the graffiti, city agents may do so. The city council recognizes that the paint used in such eradication efforts will not precisely match the existing paint. However, the eradication will not damage private property more than the damage that has already resulted from the graffiti. The eradication authorized by this section shall not, without property owner permission, extend to areas not readily visible to the general public. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city from abating graffiti pursuant to Section 1.01.090 and Title 4 of this code. (Ord. 955 § 9, 2011; Ord. 726 § 1, 1992; Ord. 694 (part), 1990)

8.72.010 Purpose. Revised 1/19
It is the purpose of this chapter to improve safety and reduce traffic by keeping the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Scenic Trail (Trail) in the Santa Cruz Branch Line Rail Corridor (Corridor) within the city of Capitola while protecting the Capitola Trestle (Trestle). (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.020 Definitions. Revised 1/19
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth in this section:

A. “Active transportation” means any form of human-powered transportation including walking, cycling, using a wheelchair or other mobility device, in-line skating or skateboarding. Such forms of transportation may include an electric assistance such as e-bikes, e-skateboards, or motorized wheelchairs.

B. “Greenway” means the space within the Corridor to be used for recreation and active transportation via a continuous pathway. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.030 Findings. Revised 1/19
A. New Public Asset. In 2012, the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission (SCCRTC) acquired the Corridor from Union Pacific. The Corridor includes the historic Trestle. For the first time, the Corridor and Trestle have the potential to be accessible for bike and pedestrian use. The SCCRTC is planning bike and pedestrian use along the majority of the Corridor.

B. Trestle Detour. The SCCRTC has proposed making the Trestle off-limits to pedestrians, bikes, electric bikes, and skateboarders, detouring pedestrian and bike traffic from the Corridor onto bike lanes and sidewalks in the local Capitola street network and across the Stockton Avenue Bridge.

C. Accessibility. A detour from the Trestle through Capitola Village would require an approximately two-hundred-foot grade change on both ends of the Trail. Keeping the Trail on the Trestle provides a flat path across Capitola, which increases accessibility for people of all ages and abilities.

D. Skateboarding for Transportation. A detour would enter Capitola’s “no skateboarding zone,” inhibiting skateboarding for transportation to New Brighton Middle School and the McGregor Pump Track and Skateboard Park. In contrast, a trail that crosses the Trestle would provide safe access to both locations.

E. Traffic and Safety. Capitola Village streets are often congested, preventing residents and visitors from getting from one side of Capitola to the other quickly and safely. Increasing pass-through bicycle and pedestrian traffic would exacerbate the existing problem.

F. Safe Routes to School. It is the stated goal of Santa Cruz County, California, Transportation Sales Tax Measure D (November 2016) to “provide safe routes to schools.” Walking and biking via the Trestle will provide safe access to New Brighton Middle School. A detour that navigates a significant grade change on narrow, busy streets will not.

G. Stated Preference. Eighty-two percent of residents who provided input regarding the Corridor in Vision Capitola 2016 supported using the Corridor for active transportation and recreation rather than a train.

H. Efficient Route. Keeping the Trail in the Corridor as it crosses the Trestle will provide a direct pathway from one side of Capitola to the other.

I. Tourism. The ability to actively use the Trestle will support the local economy by attracting tourists with a safe new way to experience breathtaking views.

J. Healthy Community and Sustainable Transportation. Bicycling and walking are by far the healthiest, most sustainable forms of transportation. Building a safer Trail will encourage more people to choose these options. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.040 Implementation. Revised 1/19
A. The city of Capitola, through its constituent departments, shall take all steps necessary to preserve and utilize the Corridor and Trestle for active transportation and recreation.

B. No city of Capitola department, agency or employee shall expend any funds or resources related to the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, financing, marketing, or signage for a detour of the Trail onto Capitola streets or sidewalks. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.050 Changes. Revised 1/19
This chapter shall not be amended or repealed except by vote of the people. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.060 Effect of adoption. Revised 1/19
Adoption of this chapter by the people shall not be construed as amending or rescinding any provisions of the general plan, local coastal program or zoning ordinances, but rather shall be construed and harmonized in a manner to strengthen and define such provisions. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

8.72.070 Severability. Revised 1/19
If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, or part of this chapter is held to be invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall be given full effect consistent with the intent and purpose of the chapter. (Ord. 1026 § 1 (part), 2018)

TEMPORARY RENTAL OF MOBILE HOMES IN MOBILE HOME PARKS

9.60.020    Temporary rental of mobile home.

9.60.030    Severability.

9.60.010 Findings and purpose.
The city council finds that various mobile home parks prohibit the owner of a mobile home from renting it for any period of time, and that such nonrental rules from time to time impose hardships on owners of mobile homes who are unable to reside in their mobile homes, but are held liable for the space rental and upkeep of their mobile home while it is vacant and until the mobile home can be sold or otherwise re-occupied. It is the purpose of this chapter to alleviate hardships on such owners who are unable to reside in their mobile homes by allowing the temporary rental of the mobile home for a reasonable period required for the owner to sell or reoccupy the mobile home. (Ord. 709 (part), 1991)

9.60.020 Temporary rental of mobile home.
It is unlawful for any person to prohibit an owner of a mobile home in a mobile home park from renting that mobile home under the following circumstances:

A. An owner of a mobile home who has resided therein for at least a one year period prior to the vacancy that necessitates renting the mobile home is unable to continue to occupy the mobile home either temporarily or permanently by reason of: (1) illness, (2) death, or (3) absence from the area for other than vacation purposes. “Absence from the area” means establishing a temporary or permanent primary abode more than thirty miles from the mobile home for an intended period of at least sixty days;

B. An owner of a mobile home who has resided therein for at least a one year period prior to the vacancy that necessitates renting the mobile home can no longer continue to meet the rules of occupancy of a mobile home park by reason of a change of circumstances (i.e., the birth of a child in an adult only mobile home park, etc.);

C. An owner or person in a fiduciary capacity who has received ownership of, or the possessory rights to, a mobile home through probate, bankruptcy, or foreclosure, or the owner’s incapacity, procedures that require time to arrange for the sale of the mobile home, or to arrange for occupancy of the mobile home by the owner;

D. Hereafter, “renter” refers to the person or persons who pay rent to the mobile home owner in exchange for the temporary right to reside within the subject mobile home (and the related right to occupy the space upon which the mobile home is located), but not as a co-occupant with the owner. Any renter of a mobile home must meet all the rules of occupancy of the mobile home park in which the mobile home is located with the exception of any rule which directly or indirectly prohibits, in conflict with this section, the temporary rental of a mobile home for up to one year. Prior to the mobile home renter’s taking occupancy, that renter and the mobile home owner shall provide the park owner with:

1. A copy of the mobile home rental agreement,

2. The true names of all intended occupants and their residential phone number,

3. Business phone numbers for all adult occupants who have such numbers, and

4. An agreement signed by all adult occupants which reads as follows:

I have received copies of the lease between the park owner and the home owner for Space # ____ and current park rules. I have read those documents with care. I believe I understand them. I believe that I qualify for occupancy under those rules and the master lease (except for provisions prohibiting subleasing). I agree to abide by those Park Rules and to meet all obligations of that master lease which are relevant to an occupant. I understand that the park owner may directly enforce the within agreement against me without giving up any rights against the mobile home owner.

E. Such temporary rentals authorized by this chapter may not exceed twelve months in any two-year period. If the mobile home owner resumes occupancy of the mobile home after a rental allowed by subsection A(3) of this section, no other rental may be allowed pursuant to that subsection until eighteen months have expired after the mobile home owner resumed occupancy. (Ord. 709 (part), 1991)

9.60.030 Severability.
If any provisions of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are severable. (Ord. 709 (part), 1991)

9.61.010 Findings.
The city council of the city makes the following findings:

A. In 1996, the voters of the state of California approved Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act (CUA), codified at California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5 et seq.

B. On January 1, 2004, S.B. 240, known as the “Medical Marijuana Program” (MMP) (codified at Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.7 through 11362.83) went into effect to clarify the scope of the CUA.

C. On January 9, 2014, the city council adopted Ordinance No. 989 to regulate the processing and cultivation of medical marijuana.

D. On November 8, 2016, California voters approved the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), which became effective immediately. Among other things, AUMA decriminalizes under state law the possession, use, transport, and purchase of limited amounts of non-medical marijuana for individuals who are twenty-one years of age or older. AUMA decriminalizes under state law the planting, cultivation, harvesting, drying, and processing (“cultivation activities”) of up to six marijuana plants in, or upon the grounds of, a private residence, but at the same time permits local jurisdictions to enact and enforce reasonable regulations to regulate indoor cultivation activities and to completely prohibit cultivation activities outdoors upon the grounds of a private residence until the California Attorney General determines that non-medical use of marijuana is lawful in the state under federal law.

E. To regulate commercial use of marijuana, the AUMA added Division 10 (Marijuana) to the Business and Professions Code, which grants state agencies “the exclusive authority to create, issue, renew, discipline, suspend or revoke” licenses for businesses including the transportation, storage, distribution, sale, cultivation, manufacturing, and testing of marijuana.

F. The AUMA authorizes cities to completely prohibit the establishment or operation of any marijuana business licensed under Division 10 within its jurisdiction including marijuana dispensaries, marijuana retailers, and marijuana delivery services. Absent appropriate local regulation authorized by the AUMA, state regulations will control marijuana activities.

G. Cannabis activities can create negative impacts relating to overall health, safety, and well-being of city residents. To the extent allowed by California law, a prohibition of commercial marijuana processing and cultivation is necessary to avoid the risks of adverse health effects, criminal activity, loitering, offensive odors, indoor structural damage, and electrical fire hazards that may result from such activities.

H. On November 6, 2018, Capitola residents passed a ballot measure authorizing the establishment of a tax on retail cannabis sales. Ordinance 1023 establishing a cannabis tax was considered adopted on December 13, 2018, the date the city council adopted Resolution No. 4136 certifying the November 6, 2018, general municipal election.

I. On December 13, 2018, Ordinance 1021 became effective, adding Chapter 5.36 of this code, Retail Cannabis Licenses, establishing a licensing structure for cannabis retail businesses, and amending Chapter 17.24 of this code, Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts, Section 17.24.020, to authorize retail cannabis sales in the CR (Regional Commercial) zoning district. (Ord. 1029 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1011 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 989 § 1 (part), 2014)

A. Any vehicle that has been parked or left standing upon a street or highway for one hundred twenty or more consecutive hours;

B. Any vehicle which is parked or left standing upon a street or highway between the hours of seven a.m. and seven p.m. when such parking or standing is prohibited by ordinance or resolution of this city and signs are posted giving notice of such removal;

C. Any vehicle which is parked or left standing upon a street or highway where the use of such street or highway or a portion thereof is necessary for the cleaning, repair or construction of the street or highway or for the installation of underground utilities or where the use of the street or highway or any portion thereof is authorized for a purpose other than the normal flow of traffic or where the use of the street or highway or any portion thereof is necessary for the movement of equipment, articles or structures of unusual size, and the parking of such vehicles would prohibit or interfere with such use or movement; provided, that signs giving notice that such vehicle may be removed are erected or placed at least twenty-four hours prior to the removal. (Ord. 204 § 2.9, 1963)

10.08.020 Hearing.
With regard to the hearing contemplated by Vehicle Code Section 22852, the following rules shall control the hearing:

A. The city manager shall designate, either by permanent designation or on a hearing-by-hearing basis, the hearing officer and the time and place of hearing. In the absence of the city manager, such designation will be made by the acting city manager. In the absence of both, the designation will be made by the chief of police.

B. Any police officers of the city or any other officer of the city who took part in the decision to originally tow the vehicle may not be hearing officer.

C. Hearings need not be conducted according to the technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses.

D. The hearing officer has the power to administer oaths and affirmations by witnesses. However, his or her failure to do so shall not necessarily prevent a witness’s testimony from being considered by him or her.

E. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objections in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state.

F. Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

G. The decision of the hearing officer may be made orally provided that within three days thereafter a short written summary of the basis for his or her decision shall be mailed to the appealing person at the address designated by such appealing person. If no such designation has been made, the written summary will be sent to the address of the owner of the vehicle as shown by Department of Motor Vehicle records.

H. The appealing person shall not have the burden of proof at any such hearing and the city shall only have the burden of going forward with evidence.

I. Where convenient, the officer or employee who directed the towing shall be present. If that is not reasonably convenient, that person may submit a written report under penalty of perjury which may be used as evidence in the hearing. The report should set forth the reasons it was not convenient for the officer or the person making the report to be pre sent at the hearing. The hearing officer shall decide two issues which are as follows:

1. Was the vehicle properly towed according to the laws of the state and the municipal ordinances of the city, and

2. Are the fees which the appellant must pay in order to obtain possession of the vehicle reasonable. In deciding this question, any towing charges or parking charges which are riot in excess of maximum charges set forth on that subject by resolution of the city council shall be deemed reasonable, and the hearing officer may use his or her own experience and sense of fairness in determining the reasonableness of the towing charges. The hearing officer may also, on his or her own accord, make inquiry of the towing company as to the amount of those charges.

J. A tape recording should be made of the hearing, but failure to do so will not invalidate the results of the hearing.

K. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. (Ord. 461 § 2, 1979)

10.32.020    Crosswalk – Use required.

10.32.030    Remaining on median strips and entering roundabouts.

10.32.010 Crosswalk – Marking.
A. The superintendent of streets shall establish, designate and maintain crosswalks at intersections and other places by appropriate devices, marks or lines upon the surface of the roadway as follows:

Crosswalks shall be established and maintained at all intersections within the central traffic district and at such intersections outside such district and at other places within or outside said district where the superintendent of streets determines that there is particular hazard to pedestrians crossing the roadway subject to the limitation contained in subsection B of this section.

B. The street superintendent may place signs at or adjacent to an intersection in respect to any crosswalk directing that pedestrians shall cross in the crosswalk so indicated. (Ord. 204 § 8, 1963)

10.32.020 Crosswalk – Use required.
No pedestrian shall cross a roadway other than by a crosswalk in the central traffic district or in any business district. (Ord. 204 § 8.1, 1963)

10.32.030 Remaining on median strips and entering roundabouts.
A. Purpose. The city council finds that when pedestrians remain on public medians in the city for purposes other than the purpose of assisting pedestrians to safely cross the street, including using the medians for, among other purposes, disorderly conduct, solicitation of money, solicitation of prostitution, consumption of alcoholic beverages, or other unlawful activity, they obstruct traffic and distract drivers, thereby threatening both their own safety and the safety of the community. The city council further finds that roundabouts are not intended to assist pedestrians or to serve any other purpose other than that described in subsection B of this section and that they therefore represent a potential hazard to pedestrians who enter onto them. This regulation is therefore necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

B. For the purposes of this section, “remain” means using a median for a purpose other than assistance in crossing the street including the purposes of disorderly conduct, solicitation of money, solicitation of prostitution, consumption of alcoholic beverages, or other activity for which they were not intended.

C. Remaining on Medians Prohibited. It is unlawful for any individual to remain on a median within a street, roadway or highway located in the city. This section shall not apply to public employees, employees of public utilities or employees of public contractors when it is necessary for them to be upon a median strip in connection with their employment duties.

D. Entering a Roundabout Is Prohibited. It is unlawful for any individual to enter onto a roundabout within a street, roadway or highway located in the city for any purpose. This section shall not apply to public employees, employees of public utilities or employees of public contractors when it is necessary for them to be upon a roundabout in connection with their employment duties.

E. Subsequent Offense Within Six Months. Any person who violates this section and who within six months after receiving such a citation for that violation again violates this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person is cited for a violation when he or she is issued and signs an infraction or misdemeanor citation, or when he or she is arrested and booked, or when a complaint is filed and the person is notified of the filing of such a complaint.

Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received by the chief of police within ten days after the mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by the city council on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or parts thereof as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle or parts thereof against the property on which it is located.

B. If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within such ten-day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require his or her presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail, at least ten days before the hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within said ten days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance without holding a public hearing. (Ord. 369 § 9, 1973)

10.52.100 Hearing – Conduct.
A. All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the city council which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. Said facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or parts thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the said private property or public property. The city council shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial.

B. The city council may impose such conditions and take such other actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or parts thereof if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may find that a vehicle or parts thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this chapter and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

C. If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the city council shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.

D. If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the city council but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the decision. In conducting the hearing, the city council shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. (Ord. 369 § 10, 1973)

10.52.110 Abatement.
Five days after adoption of the order declaring the vehicle or parts thereof to be a public nuisance, five days from the date of mailing of notice of the decision if such notice is required by Section 10.52.100, or fifteen days after such action of the governing body authorizing removal following appeal, the vehicle or parts thereof maybe disposed of by removal to a scrapyard or automobile dismantler’s yard. After a vehicle has been removed it shall not thereafter be reconstructed or made operable. (Ord. 369 § 11, 1973)

10.52.120 Notice to Department of Motor Vehicles.
Within five days after the date of removal of the vehicle or parts thereof, notice shall be given to the Department of Motor Vehicles identifying the vehicle or parts thereof removed. At the same time there shall be transmitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles any evidence of registration available, including registration certificates, certificates of title and license plates. (Ord. 369 § 12, 1973)

10.52.130 Cost collection.
If the administrative costs and the cost of removal which are charged against the owner of a parcel of land pursuant to Section 10.52.100 are not paid within thirty days of the date of the order, or the final disposition of an appeal therefrom, such costs shall be assessed against the parcel of land pursuant to Section 38773.5 of the Government Code and shall be transmitted to the tax collector for collection. Said assessment shall have the same priority as other city taxes. (Ord. 369 § 13, 1973)

Article I. Construction Permit

12.04.020 Permit – Required.
No person shall construct or have constructed upon his or her behalf any curb or gutter to official grade without first obtaining a permit from the superintendent of streets and payment to the city of a fee for the establishment of the line and official grade. (Ord. 222 § 1, 1963; Ord. 178 § l, 1962)

12.04.030 Streets staked for improvement.
On streets already staked for improvement there will be no fee charged provided the permit is obtained within thirty days after said staking and all work is completed ten days thereafter. (Ord. 222 § 2, 1963; Ord. 178 § 1-A, 1962)

12.04.040 Notice to property owners.
Notification of intention to proceed with the street improvement and informing the property owners thereof, that curb and gutter is encouraged, shall be done prior to staking but after approval of the improvement plans. (Ord. 222 § 2, 1963; Ord. 178 § 1-B, 1962)

12.04.090 Permit – Fee.
The fee shall be that established by the city council. (Ord. 178 § 2, 1962)

12.04.150 Penalty for violation.
A. It is unlawful to construct any curb or gutter without first obtaining the required permit to construct any curb or gutter without first paying the fee required by this chapter; and, to construct any curb or gutter not in accordance with the official grade.

B. Failure to comply with the terms of this chapter shall constitute a misdemeanor and be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months, or both. (Ord. 178 § 3, 1962)

Article II. Condition to Building Permit Issuance

12.04.160 Definitions.
A. “Owner” shall have the following meanings:

1. For purposes of Sections 12.04.170, 12.04.190, 12.04.200, 12.04.220 and 12.04.230, it means the equitable owner of a property (i.e., excluding therefrom the trustee or beneficiary of any security interest) and the lessee, agent, or employee of the owner of the property. In the case of situations where there is more than one person holding title, the term “owner” applies to them all even though used in the singular form.

2. For purposes of Sections 12.04.210 and 12.04.240 it means the equitable owner of the property at the time of completion of a project.

B. “Assigns of the owners” means that person or entity that has been assigned monetary rights resulting from this article by any other person or entity. The city shall have no responsibility to recognize any such assignment unless a signed, notarized instrument is presented to the city in a form which the city attorney evaluates is sufficient to create a valid assignment.

C. “Staking” refers to the process by which a surveyor, engineer, or other qualified professional places stakes or other markers upon the ground sufficient to adequately locate the place of installation of curbs, gutters, or sidewalks. (Ord. 463 §§ 2 and 3, 1979)

12.04.170 Applicability.
The requirements of this section shall be applicable in all situations where application for a building permit is made to the city for either construction upon then undeveloped property or upon property when the cost of contemplated improvements exceeds two hundred dollars multiplied times the number of front feet of the parcel upon which curbs, gutters, and sidewalks can reasonably be anticipated. An applicant for building permit who falls within the criteria of the section must fulfill one of the following three alternatives:

A. He must install, prior to the finalization of the building permit for the project, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks according to city specifications; or

B. He must deliver to the city a fully executed and binding contract for the curb, gutter, and sidewalk work. The city may have the city attorney review the instrument for legal sufficiency. If there, is a significant doubt that the instrument is sufficient to ensure that the work will, in fact, be performed, the city shall not issue the building permit. Additionally, the applicant must provide proof that completely dependable financial arrangements have been made for the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. These arrangements may consist of either the applicant depositing with the city, or in a bank account from which withdrawal is impossible without city consent, the contract price of the work or posting with the city a faithful performance bond to guarantee for a period of one year the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks according to specifications. The faithful performance bond shall be issued by a corporate security qualified to do business in the state in an amount equal to at least one and one-fourth times the amount which the public works director determines is the best estimate for the cost of the work. The faithful performance bond shall indemnify the city against the cost of installation of said curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, whether undertaken by city employees or such contractor as may be selected by the city as a result of the failure of the applicant or owner to complete the work within the prescribed period;

C. He must deposit an in-lieu fee with the city in the manner provided in this article. (Ord. 463 § 4, 1979)

12.04.180 When in-lieu deposit will be used.
Alternative C in Section 12.04.170 shall be used when any of the following situations occurs, according to the determination of the public works director:

A. It is impractical to install curbs, gutters, and sidewalks at the present time because the city engineer has not established or declared the correct grade for curbs, gutters, and sidewalks in the area wherein the property is located;

B. The applicant requests that alternative C be used and the public works director determines that the public welfare would be better served by so proceeding than by requiring installation by the applicant under alternatives A or B in Section 12.04.170;

C. In situations where the public works director has determined that significant economies would result if curbs, gutters, and sidewalks were installed on an areawide basis as opposed to individual or piecemeal projects. (Ord. 463 § 5, 1979)

12.04.190 Amount of in-lieu deposit.
The amount of the in-lieu deposit shall be a product of multiplying one and one-fourth times the number of linear feet fronting the property for which the curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, will be required pursuant to this article times the “prevailing rate for curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.” “Prevailing rate for curbs, gutters and sidewalks” means the dollar figure which the public works director determines to be the most probable price for such work at the time the deposit is made. Such determination by the public works director shall be made after conferring with those companies ordinarily conducting such building activities within the county of Santa Cruz. An applicant dissatisfied with that figure may appeal the public works director’s determination in this regard to the planning commission. (Ord. 463 § 6, 1979)

12.04.200 Time of in-lieu deposit.
The in-lieu deposit shall be made no later than the day previous to commencement of the work contemplated by the building permit application. (Ord. 463 § 7, 1979)

12.04.210 Disposition of in-lieu deposit.
The in-lieu deposit shall be handled and disposed of in the following manner:

A. Such funds shall be deposited in one or more interest bearing accounts.

B. The city shall keep such records as are necessary so as to compute with reasonable accuracy the amount of interest which has been collected as a result of a particular individual deposit with the city.

C. The curbs, gutters, and sidewalks will be installed at such time as the public works director determines it is advisable to proceed with the construction. This may be either because specifications not previously available have now been produced, or because a sufficient number of properties in a given area are ready to proceed with curb, gutter, and sidewalk construction such that the economies of scale can be achieved.

D. If more than one property is involved in a single curb, gutter, and sidewalk project, the public works director shall apportion the costs between all of the properties so involved according to the relative proportions of the linear feet of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks which are installed along the property’s frontage or frontages.

E. The deposit made for any property, together with interest attributable thereto, will then be applied to cover the cost which has been determined to be applicable to a particular property. If the cost is less than the deposit, the difference will be delivered to the then owner of the property or the assigns of that owner. If the amount of the deposit, together with interest applicable thereto, is insufficient, the city must pay the difference unless it has made other financial arrangements with one or more property owners in the vicinity.

F. If no construction of curbs, gutters, or sidewalks for the particular property has been commenced within five years of the date the in-lieu deposit was made, the moneys will at that time be returned to the then equitable owner of the property or his or her assigns. (Ord. 463 § 8, 1979)

12.04.220 Staking.
In addition to other monetary amounts required in this article, the building permit applicant shall be required, prior to issuance of the building permit, to pay the amount of money which the public works director estimates will be required for staking of the project. In cases where matters proceed by means of an in-lieu deposit as opposed to the means of subsections A or B of Section 12.04.170, any moneys so collected for staking fees shall be treated in a like manner as the rest of the in-lieu deposit. The director may allow the applicant to do its own staking. (Ord. 463 § 9, 1979)

12.04.230 Matching street to gutter elevation.
The owner of a property obtaining a building permit which is conditioned upon the installation of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks in accordance with the provisions of this article shall also install such paving as may be necessary to match the elevation and grade of the concrete gutter so installed with the existing street, consisting of the following materials:

Minimum paving required shall consist of not less than six inches of approved crusher run base material of one and one-half inch of plant mix surfacing. (Ord. 463 § 10, 1979)

12.04.240 Effect of district formation.
None of the foregoing provisions of this article shall preclude the city from instituting proceedings under any improvement district act or other such provision of state law pertinent to the installation of streets and/or curbs, gutters, or sidewalks. In case any such district comes to fruition and curbs, gutters, and sidewalks are installed as a result thereof, the in-lieu deposits may be paid directly to any such district as all or part of the contribution of the property. Any funds attributable to a particular piece of property which thereafter remain shall be delivered to the owner of the property at the time the assessment becomes official. (Ord. 463 § 11, 1979)

12.04.250 Areas excepted from this article.
The city council, by resolution, may designate areas of the city which may be exempt from the provisions of this article. In making any such determination, the city shall weigh the following factors:

A. Whether improvement to drainage and whether improvement of the aesthetics of the area are negligible compared to the costs of curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks;

B. Whether the neighborhood has, for the most part, already been largely built out and few or none of the properties have previously installed curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks;

C. Whether adequate easements and street width exist for the installation of curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks;

D. Whether failure to provide curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks would be detrimental to there being established an integrated system of curbs, gutters, and/or sidewalks within the city or within an area of the city which is much larger than the area of proposed exception.

In any such areas where curb, gutter, and/or sidewalk is not mandatory, no curb, gutter or sidewalk may be privately installed without first obtaining a permit from the city council. (Ord. 731, 1992; Ord. 463 § 12, 1979)

12.08.010 Permits.
No person shall open, excavate or dig any trench, tunnel or opening in any public street in the city without first obtaining a permit from the public works department. When work requiring a permit under this chapter is commenced before a permit is issued, the fee for any permit thereafter issued for such work shall be twice the normal permit fee. (Ord. 462 § 2, 1980)

12.08.020 Applications.
Any person desiring a permit required by this chapter shall submit an application to the public works department on a form provided by the public works department. The application shall be signed by the, applicant and shall include such information as may be required by the director, including local address for service of notices. (Ord. 462 § 3, 1980)

12.08.030 Fees.
The public works department, prior to the issuance of any street opening permit, shall demand and collect a fee for each permit duly and regularly issued. The permit fee shall be determined by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 462 § 4, 1980)

12.08.040 Issuance of permit.
The director may grant the permit if he or she determines that the work will be performed in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of the law. If all the conditions for issuance of the permit have been met, and if in his or her judgment the proposed work is consistent with the public interest and convenience, the director will grant the permit. Nothing herein shall be deemed to compel the director to issue any permit if in his or her judgment the proposed work is against the public interest or convenience. In granting a permit, the director may impose such conditions as are consistent with the public interest or convenience and with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 462 § 5, 1980)

12.08.050 Time limit and damages payable for violation thereof.
A. In addition to such other conditions as may be imposed, the public works director at the time the permit is issued shall establish a time within which the work, once commenced, must be completed. The public works director may limit the time of commencement so as to prevent the work from occurring during times of heavy traffic, such as the Christmas season. Once a permit is issued, a permittee may, at any time, apply to the public works director for an extension of the time period, based on any combination of the following grounds:

1. Unusual weather conditions which have substantially prevented ordinary work on the project;

2. Otherwise expeditious conduct of the project has shown the original time period to have been unrealistic;

3. During the course of the work, unforeseen physical conditions have been encountered;

4. Unforeseen circumstances caused by the third parties, such as strikes.

B. The following shall not be considered valid reasons for an extension of the time period:

1. Convenience of the permittee or his or her agents;

2. Permittee desires to devote the time and resources of himself or herself and his or her agents to other endeavors;

3. Disputes or difficulties between the permittee and his or her contractors, agents or employees;

4. Inadequate staffing, preparation or planning by the permittee.

C. The city recognizes that streets which are torn up any longer than is absolutely necessary nose an inconvenience and burden to the public. Belated completion of the work, whether the completion is done by the city or the applicant, does not cure the damage done to the members of the public who are so inconvenienced or delayed. In recognition of this, the acceptance of a permit under this chapter and commencement of the work under the permit shall constitute the acceptance by the permittee of the following provisions for damages and permittee shall be contractually liable therefor:

Permittee recognizes that the actual detriment to the public caused by the untimely repair of the streets is impossible to precisely quantify. As a measure of the damages due to inconvenience and delay only, the permittee agrees that it must pay to the city one hundred dollars for every day or part thereof, and for every block or part thereof, in which the work remains uncompleted beyond the time period specified in the permit, together with any extensions of said time period. This provision shall not limit other remedies of the city herein provided nor remedies of third parties for damage suffered other than by reason of inconvenience and delay.

D. Any person subjected to the payment of damage pursuant to this section may appeal to the city council which shall conduct a de novo hearing on any such appeal. Any such appeal shall be confined to the following grounds:

1. The public works director has refused to grant a reasonable extension of time. If an appeal is upheld on this ground, the council shall determine the period of a reasonable extension.

2. The project by its nature was of such a negligible burden to the public so as to render the per-day assessment of damages excessive. If an appeal is sustained on this basis, the council shall declare a lesser figure which is fair under the circumstances. (Ord. 462 § 6, 1980)

12.08.060 Blanket permits to utilities and certain governmental districts.
The public works director is empowered to grant permits wherein a general description of activities may be set forth which are exempt from the requirement of seeking repetitive permits. An example would be activities which do, not intrude upon the traveled portion of the roadway. Such blanket permits may be granted to any utility regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of California or to any governmental district such as the water district. Any such permit is revokable at any time upon five days written notice. (Ord. 462 § 7, 1980)

12.08.070 Restrictions on street cutting.
Except when the permittee is a utility regulated by the Public Utilities Commission or some governmental district:

A. All work authorized or required upon the issuance of a permit under this chapter shall be performed by, or under the direction of, a contractor licensed to perform the work authorized by the permit.

B. The person opening any street or public way (sidewalk) of any kind or nature within the city limits shall do so by cutting the area to be removed by an abrasive saw or other such method as approved by the public works department.

C. The work for which the permit is issued, once commenced, shall be prosecuted with due diligence and so as not to obstruct the street or travel thereon more than is actually necessary to perform the work.

D. Any opening trench, tunnel or excavation made shall be backfilled with a structural sand or other structural backfill material in a good and workmanlike manner with thorough compaction of the backfill material either by jetting, tamping or other method which, in the judgment of the public works department, will give satisfactory results. No native material is to be used as backfill.

E. Pavement shall be replaced in kind; however, minimum standards are as follows:

1. .50'' prime coated class 2 aggregate base;

2. 2' asphalt concrete type B.

F. All costs and expenses of all work required by this chapter and undertaken by the applicant in connection with the issuance of the permit shall be borne by the applicant or by other person who agrees to bear such costs and expenses. The city shall not be responsible for any such costs or expenses. (Ord. 462 § 8, 1980)

12.08.080 Safety requirements.
No person shall perform or cause to be performed any work on the streets of Capitola unless such person shall place or cause to be placed appropriate traffic-control devices and other safety equipment for the protection of the public and construction workers. The standards of the State Manual of Traffic Controls are used as the accepted standards for the placement of traffic control devices. (Ord. 462 § 9, 1980)

12.08.090 Completion of work.
Upon restoration of the street to its original condition, the work shall be subject to a final inspection. The director of public works may require that the final inspection be completed before the permittee’s workmen leave the job site. (Ord. 462 § 10, 1980)

12.08.100 One-day notice to abate violations.
If a permit has been issued for any work under this chanter, and if any work in connection with such permit is performed in violation of any provision of this chapter or in violation of any terms or conditions of such permit, the director of public works may notify the person performing the work to correct the violation within one day; such notice shall be in writing, shall specify the nature of the violation and shall be served on the person to whom the permit was issued, on the person causing the work to be performed, or on the person supervising any part of the work. The notice may be served on such person by delivery to such person at the job site or by leaving a copy of the notice at the address specified in the permit application as the address for service of notices. If the violation is not corrected as required by the notice, the public works director may immediately cause the street to be restored to its original condition. (Ord. 462 § 11, 1980)

12.08.110 Public nuisance.
Any work performed in violation of the requirements of this chapter or in violation of any permit issued under this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance. Where no permit has been issued hereunder in connection with such work, or where such work constitutes an immediate hazard to the public safety, the public works director may immediately take such steps as are necessary or appropriate to abate the nuisance, including removal of any improvements installed in connection with such work, restoration of the street to its original condition, or any other steps necessary or appropriate to protect the public safety. Such work may be done by the director of public works, without prior notice to the person causing such nuisance to exist. In order to abate any nuisance as defined herein, whether performed with or without a permit, the director may pursue any other appropriate legal or equitable remedies available for the abatement of public nuisances. (Ord. 462 § 12, 1980)

12.08.120 Costs a debt to city.
If any person performs street cutting or street improvement work in violation of the requirements of this chapter or in violation of any terms and conditions of any permit issued under this chapter, and if because of such violation the city performs work or incurs expenses in correcting such violation or in restoring the street to its original condition, then the cost of any such work performed and any expenses so incurred by the city shall be a debt due to the city from any person whose violation caused the city’s work to be performed, which debt shall be payable upon demand. (Ord. 462 § 13, 1930)

12.08.130 Exemptions.
The following are exempted from the requirements of this chapter:

A. Work done under the provisions of any Street Improvement Act of the state of California;

B. Work performed by any department, board or officer of the city in the course of official duty;

Article I. Purpose, Goals, and Authority

12.12.010 Purpose.
The city council finds that protection and enhancement of existing tree cover throughout the city serves several public interests: reducing local air pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen; reducing soil erosion; enhancing the visual and aesthetic qualities of the city that attract visitors and businesses and serve as a source of community image and pride; and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.

The city council finds that trees are a valuable asset and have a positive economic effect on the city by enhancing property values and making the city a more attractive place to visit and do business. The protection and enhancement of trees helps safeguard and enhance the property values of public and private investments, and preserves and protects the unique identity and environment of Capitola. Healthy trees of the appropriate size and species, growing in the appropriate places, enhance the value and marketability of property and promote the stability of desirable neighborhoods.

In order to protect existing tree cover, increase tree cover, and enhance the natural beauty of the city, the city council, therefore, adopts this chapter in the interest of public health and safety. The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations relating to the protection, planting, maintenance, removal, and replacement of trees, and to set forth the process for development of a comprehensive plan for the planting and maintenance of a sustained community forest within the city. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.020 Goals and policies.
A. The overall goals of this chapter are to protect and increase the level of tree cover on public and private lands within the city, maintain trees in a healthy and non-hazardous condition, and promote planting of additional trees to increase tree cover (hereby referred to as canopy coverage) throughout the city.

B. It is the policy of the city to protect the locally significant, scenic and mature trees as listed in the heritage tree list to be adopted pursuant to this chapter, in order to protect the character of Capitola.

C. It is the policy of the city to encourage new tree planting on public and private property and to cultivate a flourishing community forest.

D. It is the goal of the city to maintain and enhance the tree canopy coverage existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter (as determined through aerial photography taken within twelve months from adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter), and to increase flowering tree canopy to help identify and beautify city streets and neighborhoods.

E. On individual lots, it is the goal of the city to maintain fifteen percent coverage of tree canopy, consisting of flowering, deciduous, and evergreen trees, to be enforced on an on-going basis via the design review process.

F. It is the goal of the city to establish a community tree fund to pay for tree replacement planting in suitable locations in city parks, sensitive habitat areas, or along city streets, as set forth in a “community forest program,” to be completed and adopted within three years from adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

G. It is the goal of the city to develop partnerships with the owners of heritage trees to provide technical and financial help for the maintenance of such trees, as funds become available in the community tree fund.

H. It is the policy of the city to pursue grants to fund a monitoring program to evaluate the performance of this chapter, every three years after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

I. It is the policy of the city to encourage community efforts such as the “Heritage Tree Walk,” and promote education programs to increase the awareness of trees and their benefits.

J. It is the policy of the city to help counteract carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by planting trees, as trees absorb CO2 from the air, and store it in their branches, roots and trunks and then release oxygen into the atmosphere.

K. It is the policy of the city that the regulations of this chapter regarding tree planting, maintenance, removal and replacement take into consideration the protection of view sheds and solar orientation and exposure, in relation to all affected properties. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

Article II. Tree Planting

12.12.050 Community forest program.
The director, with the advice and participation of the public works director, planning commission, and city council, may prepare a “community forest program” to guide tree replanting efforts throughout the city, including planting on public properties, streets, parks and sensitive habitat areas. This program would be established as a result from the collection of fees and potential grant funding.

A. Program Elements. The program shall incorporate the following elements: mapping identification of tree planting sites; prioritized planting plan and schedule; standards and lists of trees for tree selection, including the Capitola recommended tree list; guidelines for sitting, planting and pruning of trees on public property; maintenance plan; inspection requirements and specific licensing requirements for tree trimmers.

B. Program Incentives. The community forest program should provide for financial and technical incentives, and eligibility criteria, for activities such as:

1. Maintenance and problem solving for heritage trees, such as arborists’ evaluations, are possible mitigations to save a heritage tree, including selective removal of roots, branches and/or special trimming;

2. Planting incentives to encourage increased canopy coverage and neighborhood identity;

3. Other incentives to encourage educational efforts similar to the heritage tree walk.

C. Program Provisions. The community forest program should include several planting and maintenance items including, but not limited to:

1. Specific city permit requirements for tree trimmers/tree climbers needed to obtain a “city permit to operate,” such as relationship with or employment of a certified arborist and certified tree climber; insurance and contractor’s license; low noise producing equipment; and commitment to follow provisions of city ordinance;

2. Retain a certified arborist under a city contract to perform tree evaluation and reports on heritage and nonheritage trees for a flat fee, paid for by the applicant. The contract certified arborist should be retained as soon as the ordinance codified in this chapter is effective.

3. Specific provisions for public works department staff to monitor compliance with project conditions of approval and supervise/monitor replacement trees on public property.

D. Flowering Trees. The program would encourage the planting of large and/or small flowering trees, according to different neighborhoods. Deciduous flowering trees would allow sun exposure in the winter months and provide color in the spring and other seasons. Flowering trees can create neighborhood identity. A tree expert should review the program prior to its adoption.

E. Neighborhood Entries. The program would incorporate a section regarding the selection of at least two suggested flowering trees per neighborhood, and provisions for a neighborhood entry sign with a few of those colored trees being planted around the sign to establish the neighborhood program. Property owners would be encouraged to plant similar trees on their properties with the objective of creating a special identity for their neighborhood. Suggested flowering trees would reflect specific neighborhood characteristics, such as view shed issues, character protection, and soils. The city may provide an incentive to property owners, by supplying young trees for “free” to accelerate the show of specific neighborhood colors. The approval of the selected neighborhood flowering trees shall be subject to a regularly scheduled public hearing so as to inform the residents and welcome participation. There is no obligation on the part of the resident to plant a selected tree.

F. Funding. In addition to resources of the tree and canopy replacement in-lieu fees to be deposited in the community tree and forest management account, the program would pursue potential grant funding to pay for educational efforts, monitoring and evaluation of this chapter. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.060 Description of existing canopy coverage.
The canopy coverage throughout the city includes all trees on public and private properties, including street trees, parks, and habitat areas. Habitat areas include riparian corridors and monarch butterfly habitat, as identified in the general plan, local coastal program and the city’s environmentally sensitive habitats ordinance (Chapter 17.95 of this code).

On individual lots, canopy coverage shall be evaluated as part of tree removal permit or development application requests as set forth in Section 12.12.190. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.070 Tree planting.
A. Recommended Tree List.

1. Development of the Capitola Recommended Tree List. The director, with the advice and participation of the planning commission and city council, shall prepare a “Capitola recommended tree list” to identify types and species of trees suitable and desirable for planting along streets and on private property, and determine the areas in which and conditions under which such trees shall be planted in or which may overhang the public streets or public property. The list should reflect the different city natural habitats and neighborhoods; and should encourage use of California natives and drought-tolerant species. Such determination shall be made by the planning commission, which may consult with landscape architects and arborists. The planning commission may report its findings in writing to the city council, and the council may approve the “Capitola recommended tree list,” which may be filed and available to the public from the community development department, or as part of the community forest program.

2. Purpose. The purpose of the Capitola recommended tree list is to help property owners to select new trees for their properties. The list shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: botanical and common names; suitability as a street tree; height; physical characteristics (deciduous or evergreen, required exposure); decorative features (flowering and/or scented); and tolerances to drought, insects, diseases, saline environment, and irrigation watering. Recommended flowering trees for identified neighborhoods may also be included.

B. Trees Discouraged from Planting. Please refer to the Capitola recommended tree list.

C. Considerations Related to Solar Orientation. The planting, and replacement of trees shall take into consideration solar orientation for the benefit of the property in question as well as adjacent properties. For more information, please refer to brochures available at the community development department regarding considerations related to solar orientation and planting locations for trees in order to maximize sun exposure in the winter and shaded areas in the summer. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.080 Environmental and socio-economic benefits of trees.
Tree provisions covering planting, maintenance, and removal of trees on public and private land help to maintain maximum tree cover/canopy coverage. As tree size and canopy coverage increase the benefits derived from the urban forest increase. The benefit/cost ratio of urban trees for a community is as high as seven and nine-tenths to one, and well worth the investment. Property values of landscaped homes are five to twenty percent higher than those of non-landscaped homes (International Society of Arboriculture). A city brochure on the “Environmental and Socio-Economic Benefits of Trees” is available to provide information regarding energy conservation, air quality, prevention of water run-off, flooding and soil erosion, enhancement of community identity and well-being, and protection of city hardscape. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

Article III. Maintenance and Protection Strategy

12.12.090 Heritage tree historic context.
Capitola has a rich heritage in its trees. Residents have been committed to their cultivation and preservation since the city’s inception as Camp Capitola in 1874 on lands owned by Frederick A. Hihn, on which tree removal was prohibited and an extensive tree-planting program was undertaken. Heritage trees help define the character of the city. By virtue of their historic significance, size, beauty, age or value to wildlife, heritage trees offer intrinsic benefits to the entire city as well as individual properties. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.100 Heritage tree list and nomination process.
A. Definition. “Heritage tree” shall mean any locally significant, historic, scenic and/or mature tree growing on public or private property, that is listed on the city’s adopted heritage tree list as set forth in this section, that is supported by the property owner and by the city council. A heritage tree list should be adopted no longer than six months from the approval of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

B. Heritage Tree List.

1. Nomination. Nominations of trees for inclusion on the heritage tree list may be made from any person to the community development department if it meets one or more of the following criteria. Upon receiving consent of the owner of the property on which the tree is located, the community development director submits the nominated tree(s) to the planning commission for consideration and approval.

a. Any tree which has a trunk with a circumference of forty-four inches approximately fourteen inches in diameter or more, measured at forty-eight inches above existing grade or at average breast height (abh);

b. Any tree, or grove of trees, which has historical significance, including, but not limited to, those which were/are:

i. Planted as a commemorative,

ii. Planted during a particularly significant historical era, or

iii. Marking the spot of a historical event;

c. Any tree, or grove of trees, which has horticultural significance, including, but not limited to, those which are:

i. Unusually beautiful or distinctive,

ii. Old (determined by comparing the age of the tree in question with other trees of its species within the city),

iii. Distinctive specimen in size or structure for its species (determined by comparing the tree to average trees of its species within the city),

iv. A rare or unusual species for the Capitola area (to be determined by the number of similar trees of the same species within the city),

v. Providing a valuable wild life habitat, or

vi. Identified by the city council as having significant arboricultural value to the citizens of the city.

2. Property Owner Support. No tree shall be considered by the planning commission or included on the heritage tree list by the planning commission unless written property owner consent has been obtained, agreeing to the nomination and designation.

3. Approval of Heritage Trees. The planning commission shall review and approve nominations for heritage trees via a public hearing properly noticed. The main function of the public hearing is to announce the trees nominated and to educate the community regarding heritage trees.

4. Removal of Tree from Heritage Tree List. A tree or trees shall be removed from the heritage tree list upon approval of a heritage tree removal permit by the planning commission, and/or the adoption of a resolution by the city council in case a removal permit is not applicable, based on findings by a qualified arborist that:

a. The tree is a hazard to public health and safety or to other trees as per Section 12.12.210 of this chapter; or

b. The tree no longer retains or holds the values and the community interest for which it was placed upon the heritage tree list.

C. Protection of Heritage Trees. No person shall allow any condition to exist, which may be harmful to any heritage tree, including, but not limited to, any of the following conditions:

1. Existence of any tree, heritage or otherwise, within the city limits that is irretrievably infested or infected with insects, scale or disease detrimental to the health of any heritage tree;

2. Paving and/or filling up the ground area around any heritage tree so as to shut off air, light or water to its roots;

3. Piling building materials, parking equipment and/or pouring any substance, which may be detrimental to the health of any heritage tree;

4. Posting any sign, poster, notice or similar device on any heritage tree;

5. Driving metal stakes, tying ropes, wire or metal braces and similar restricting devices, into the heritage tree or their root area for any purpose other than supporting and healing the heritage tree, except if recommended by a certified arborist;

6. Causing a fire to burn near any heritage tree;

7. Excessive pruning of the tree to cause its death;

8. “Choking” trees with undergrowth (heavy ivy).

D. Incentives. It is the goal of the city to develop partnerships with owners of heritage trees and provide incentives for maintenance, such as technical and financial assistance to maintain heritage trees as funds accumulate in the community tree and forest management account. Owners of heritage trees are eligible, according to certain criteria, to apply for city financial incentives/grants from the community tree and forest management account for maintenance and preservation of heritage trees. These criteria include, but are not limited to: having the tree listed on the adopted heritage tree list; needing the services of an arborist to address invasive root problems; needing special pruning services to clear tree branches due to utility lines; needing to diagnose disease problems, and having no code violations within the subject property; as listed in the community forest program. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.110 Permit process for removal and pruning of heritage trees.
A. Permit Required. No person shall prune, trim, cut off, or perform any work, on a single occasion or cumulatively, over a three-year period, affecting twenty-five percent or more of the crown and/or the volume of foliage and branches of any heritage tree without first obtaining a permit pursuant to this section. No person shall root prune, relocate or remove any heritage tree without first obtaining a permit pursuant to this section. No permits are required for maintenance trimming.

The permit application shall include the number, species, size, and location of each subject tree, a clear description of the work being proposed, and the reason for the requested action. An arborist report must also be submitted.

C. Process. Permits for heritage tree removal or pruning over twenty-five percent within a three-year period are discretionary and are approved by the planning commission only in accordance with CEQA and if the findings in this section can be made.

D. Findings and Conditions.

1. The tree removal is in the public interest based on one of the following:

a. Because of the health or condition of the tree, with respect to disease or infestation; or

b. For safety considerations or danger of falling on persons or property; or

c. In situations where a tree has caused, or has the potential to cause, unreasonable property damage.

2. Pruning, root removal, and all other feasible alternatives to removal have been applied and were not sufficient to resolve the problem.

12.12.120 Harming trees unlawful.
It is unlawful for any person to break, injure, deface, mutilate, kill or destroy any street tree (heritage or non-heritage tree) or set fire or permit any fire to burn where such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree in any public street in the city, nor shall any person place, apply, attach or keep attached to any such tree or to the guard of stake intended for the protection thereof any wire, rope, (other than one used to support a young or broken tree) sign, paint, or any other substance, structure, thing or device of any kind whatsoever, without having first obtained a permit so to do. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.130 Tree protection, management and maintenance.
A. Protection of Trees. New residential or commercial development, including driveways and parking areas, shall be sited and designed to minimize cutting of trees, especially trees that provide screening from neighboring properties or provide buffer between different uses. A plan for tree protection and preservation may be required at the time the development application is submitted.

B. Tree Planting, Pruning and Maintenance. The city may make available to the public a “planting, pruning, and maintenance brochure,” and may provide technical assistance as funds become available in the community tree and forest management account. This brochure should also include guidelines for where not to plant trees, such as under power lines, too close to the neighboring property lines, and so forth.

C. Safeguarding Trees During Construction, Demolition or Tree Removal. For the purpose of safeguarding trees during construction, demolition or tree removal, the following conditions should apply to all trees other than trees for which a removal permit has been issued:

1. Pre-construction Guidelines. Prior to the commencement of construction, demolition or tree removal, all trees on the building site should be inventoried by the owner or contractor or project arborist as to size, species and location on the lot, and the inventory should be submitted on a topographical map to the community development director. This condition may be waived by the community development director for tree removal and minor demolition.

2. The property owner, contractor or project arborist shall be required to erect protective barricades around the dripline of all trees to be retained on the site to provide protection during construction. These barricades must be in place prior to the start of any construction or demolition activities. Under certain conditions where soil compaction is probable, fences may also be required around a tree or grouping of trees.

3. Earth surfaces within the dripline of any tree should not be changed or compacted. All equipment, construction material, and soil storage shall be kept beyond the dripline of trees.

4. Wires, signs and other similar items should not be attached to trees.

5. Cutting and filling around the base of trees should be done only after consultation with a certified arborist. Wherever cuts are made in the ground near the roots of trees, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent exposed soil from drying out and causing damage to tree roots.

6. Pruning cuts shall conform to ANSI arboricultural standards and should not cut into the branch bark ridge or collar, or leave a stub. Please refer to the “Tree, Shrub, and Other Woody Plant Maintenance – Standard Practices (Pruning)” published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) for pruning practices. In cases of conflict between pruning standards, the standards in this chapter shall apply.

7. Damage to any tree during construction, demolition or tree removal should be immediately reported by the person causing the damage, the responsible contractor or the property owner to the community development director, and the contractor and/or owner should treat the tree for damage in the manner specified by the city’s contract arborist, and/or public works director.

8. The property owner is responsible for care of all trees that are to remain on the site.

9. Failure to protect or maintain trees on construction/demolition sites is a violation of this code and grounds for suspension of the building permit.

D. Safeguarding Trees that are Required to be Planted as a Condition of Tree Removal Permit Approval.

1. Trees required to be kept on a building site and trees required to be planted as a condition of tree removal permit approval shall be maintained according to accepted arboricultural practices. If the tree dies the applicant shall be required to replace the tree as many times as necessary.

2. At no time shall these trees be moved without the issuance of a valid permit.

3. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to replace or revoke any requirements for the safeguarding of trees found elsewhere in this code or in the ordinances and procedures of the city. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.140 License – Tree pruning business.
Any tree service company employed by an owner or public utility to carry out any act for which a permit is required under Section 12.12.110 or Section 12.12.180 shall comply with the city’s tree pruning guidelines, obtain a city operation permit, a clearance from the community development director, and shall include the services of certified arborist, a certified tree climber/trimmer, proof of contractor’s license and insurance. Refer to list of city approved tree pruning businesses, tree trimmers, licensed contractors and certified arborists. Property owners pruning their own trees shall also comply with the provision of this chapter. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.150 Educational programs.
The community development director may make available to interested persons, copies of:

A. The community forest management ordinance;

B. Summary handouts regarding the ordinance;

C. The “Capitola recommended tree planting list;”

D. The “Capitola heritage tree list;”

E. The “Heritage Tree Walk” brochure;

F. The community forest program;

G. Pamphlets describing where, when, how and what tree to plant, listing the various choices for size, architectural, structural, leaf and bark color, and other elements of the trees;

H. The city’s “list of certified arborists, tree trimmers, and licensed contractors;”

I. The “Planting, Pruning and Maintaining Trees” brochure; and

J. The “Environmental and Socio-Economic Benefits of Trees” brochure. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

Article IV. Tree Removal and Replacement

12.12.160 Permit requirements.
A. Permit Required. Except as herein provided, no person may, in the city, cause the cutting or intentional killing of any tree within the city unless a tree removal permit has been obtained and has been prominently displayed in the area of the cutting for the time provided in this chapter. As part of any development application considered by it, the planning commission, or the community development director, may allow tree removal or pruning, as applicable. All trees within environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall require a tree removal permit, and issuance of such permits for tree removals, pruning, cutting and trimming shall be consistent with Chapter 17.95, the environmentally sensitive habitats ordinance. Any tree removal or pruning activity must be specifically allowed in the permit. Refer to Section 12.12.110 for permit process for removal and pruning of heritage trees.

B. Pruning Allowable without Permit.

1. Non-heritage trees located on lots used solely as a single-family residence or duplex and not located within environmentally sensitive habitat areas may be pruned as follows:

a. One-fourth or not more than twenty-five percent of the tree’s height;

b. One-fourth or not more than twenty-five percent of the volume of its foliage and branches;

c. Within environmentally sensitive habitat areas as described in Chapter 17.95, Environmental Sensitive Habitats, all degrees of pruning shall be defined as “cutting” and shall require a permit.

2. The foregoing measurements are based on the largest size ever obtained by the existing tree. If that size cannot be precisely determined, then the community development director’s best estimate of largest size shall be utilized. In the later case, the community development director would utilize average tree size information from standard landscape books, such as the Sunset Book and take into consideration local soil and other circumstances to make the final decision.

3. Pruning of trees should be done only as needed, but not more often than every two years, to ensure pruning is not causing a hardship for the tree.

C. Topping/Heading Cuts Prohibited. Topping, heading cuts to public and private trees is prohibited. Topping/heading cuts are often done to reduce a tree’s size by shortening of limbs or branches back to a predetermined crown limit. It can result in indiscriminate cutting back of major limbs to stubs or to lateral branches that are not large enough to assume the terminal/leader role. It weakens the tree structure, causes inappropriate and rapid growth, and may result in reduced vigor, disease, decay, decline, or sudden death of the tree.

1. Alternative to Topping/Heading. There are times when a tree must be reduced in height or spread. Pruning methods approved by the International Society of Arboriculture such as “crown reduction” is recommended in these instances. “Crown reduction” is the selective removal or reduction of major limbs to proper lateral branches to decrease height and spread. “Thinning cuts,” “drop-crotch pruning” and “end weight reduction” are used to reduce the length and weight on the ends of branches. These pruning methods result in healthier more natural appearing trees, where new branches will not be hanging and attached only to the outside of the tree trunk but will structurally grow from the tree itself.

2. Providing Clearance for Utility Lines. There are recommended techniques for line clearance by the ISA, such as “directional pruning.” This method includes the removal of branches with proper cuts to direct the growth of the crown and limbs away from and around conductors. If a branch must be shortened, it should be cut back to a significant lateral that is large enough to assume the terminal role or the “leader” role. A rule of thumb for this is to cut back to a lateral that is at least one-third the diameter of the limb being removed, so the lateral can take over the structural role of the central or lateral leader. For more information refer to brochures from the International Society of Arboriculture available at the community development department.

D. Permit – Public Utility or Agency. Any person doing business as a public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of the state and constituted public agency authorized to provide and providing utility service, shall apply for an annual permit for trimming and/or other tree related work; such permit shall include specific guidelines and conditions reflecting requirements in this chapter, permitting such person to trim, brace, remove or perform such other acts with respect to trees growing adjacent to the public streets of the city or which grow upon private property, to the extent that they encroach upon such public streets as may be necessary to comply with the safety regulations of said commission and as may be necessary to maintain the safe operations of its business, as well as be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.170 Exceptions.
Fruit-bearing trees are exempted from the provisions of this chapter, with exception of large and mature fruit trees that could fit the definition of a heritage tree. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.180 Permit process for removal of non-heritage trees.
A. Application. All persons, utilities and any department or agency located in the city shall submit a permit application, together with the appropriate fee as set forth by city council resolution, to the community development department prior to performing any work requiring a permit as set forth in this section. The permit application shall include the number, species, size, and location of each subject tree, description of replacement trees, location and schedule of planting, and the reason for the requested action. An arborist report may be required, and if approved, notice of the tree removal shall be posted on site and at City Hall ten working days prior to the removal.

B. Process. Permits for non-heritage tree removal or pruning are ministerial and are approved by the community development director or designee. A staff in the public works department can approve the removal of a non-heritage tree only if the findings of subsections (C)(1) through (C)(4) of this section can be made. If these finding cannot be made, the application shall be transferred to the planning staff for further review and canopy coverage evaluation. The city may require the applicant to pay for services of an arborist under contract to the city, to provide recommendations and/or a written evaluation or report regarding the tree. Then, based on the city’s evaluation or report, the director would make a decision as to whether or not the tree should be removed. The community development director shall make all findings listed below prior to a tree removal determination. The director may require planning commission review and approval of the permit.

C. Findings.

1. The tree removal is in the public interest based on one of the following:

a. Because of the health or condition of the tree, with respect to disease infestation, or danger of falling;

b. Safety considerations; or

c. In situations where a tree has caused, or has the potential to cause, unreasonable property damage and/or interference with existing utility services.

2. All possible and feasible alternatives to tree removal have been evaluated, including, but not limited to undergrounding of utilities, selective root cutting, trimming and relocation.

3. The type, size and schedule for planting replacement trees is specified and shall be concurrent with the tree removal or prior to it, in accordance with Section 12.12.190(F) and (G).

4. The removal of the tree would not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter and Chapter 17.95.

5. Replacement trees in a ratio of two to one as needed to ensure that with replacement trees a canopy coverage of at least fifteen percent will result, and location(s) for tree replanting are selected, and/or as a last resort, in-lieu fees have been paid as a condition of the permit in accordance with Section 12.12.190. Replacement trees and/or in-lieu fees are not required if post-removal tree canopy coverage on the site or parcel will be thirty percent or more.

D. Canopy Coverage Review. On individual lots, it is the goal of the city to maintain a fifteen percent coverage of tree canopy, consisting of flowering, deciduous trees and evergreen trees. Canopy coverage goals shall be evaluated as part of: (a) tree removal requests for trees that are not found to be diseased, infested, or hazardous; (b) as part of review of development applications on vacant properties; and (c) as part of tree replacement requirements that cannot be met on site. Tree removal requests may be approved for trees that do not meet the findings in relation to canopy coverage as stated in Section 12.12.180(C)(5), if it is determined that the site canopy coverage goal will be maintained or exceeded with removal of the tree. Replacement trees and/or in-lieu fees are not required if post-removal tree canopy coverage on the site or parcel will be thirty percent or more. If other city regulations such as the 41st Avenue Design Guidelines establish a different and/or higher tree-planting standard than the requirement of fifteen percent canopy coverage, the higher standard shall apply.

E. Effective Date of Permit. The decision of the community development director shall be final unless appealed to the planning commission by the permit applicant or any other aggrieved person pursuant to this section. Unless appealed, the permit shall take effect ten working days after it is issued, except where the tenth day occurs on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, in which case the effective date shall be extended to the next following business day. All work performed on any trees, including designated heritage trees pursuant to a permit as provided in this section shall be completed within forty-five days from the effective date of the permit, or within such longer period as the director may specify, and in case of replacement trees work shall be completed in accordance with Section 12.12.190(F).

F. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any act or determination, contained, provided or granted in this chapter shall have the right to appeal the director’s decision within ten working days from approval or denial, to the planning commission, and the planning commission’s decision to the city council of the city, whose decision, after public hearing on said matter, shall be final.

All appeals must be in writing, state the reasons therefore, and must be made within ten working days of permit approval and delivered to the office of the city clerk. Community development director decisions are appealable to the planning commission. Planning commission decisions are appealable to the city council. However, the city council, at its sole discretion, may determine whether to hear or not to hear any such appeal. If the council decides not to hear or consider the appeal, the planning commission decision shall be final. All appeal hearings shall be de novo. Any tree related permit which has been issued and which has been appealed shall, during any appeal period, be suspended. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.190 Tree replacement.
A. Tree Replacement Ratio. An approval for tree removal under this chapter shall be conditioned upon the applicant planting, at some other location on the subject property, replacement trees to compensate for the removed tree(s) on a ratio of at least two trees or more for each one tree removed, as determined by the director. Replacement trees and/or in-lieu fees are not required if post-removal tree canopy coverage on the site or parcel will be thirty percent or more. Native trees grown from locally or regionally collected stock are preferred, in the case where a native tree is not appropriate as determined by the community development director, a non-invasive exotic tree may be planted.

B. Tree Replacement Size to be Planted On Site. The community development director and/or his or her designee shall approve the type and size of replacement trees. Generally, twenty-four-inch box or larger trees should replace trees located upon properties zoned or used in whole or in part for commercial purposes. Fifteen gallon or larger trees should replace those located upon residential properties. Size of tree could vary per recommendation of a certified arborist and acceptance by the community development director and/or designee. For replacement selection, the applicant should refer to Chapter 17.97, Water-Efficient Landscaping, and/or to the community forest program. Trees to be planted on public property or on sensitive habitat zone shall be based on the community forest program guidelines and performance standards developed pursuant to Section 12.12.050, Community forest program. Replacement of canopy coverage calculations can be determined on the basis of the size of the subject trees removed, or based on standard landscape guides, such as the Sunset Book.

C. Replacement of Canopy Coverage Related to Development Applications. New construction and major remodels of residential and commercial structures shall trigger a canopy coverage review. The goal of the city is to reach and maintain at least fifteen percent tree coverage per lot on an on-going basis. Project conditions of approval shall require planting or replacement of all or part of the trees necessary to meet the city goal per discretion of the community development director and/or the planning commission as applicable. Planting and replacement should be done within the same lot, possibly in different locations. As a last resort, should tree planting on site not be possible due to existing, nonself-imposed hardship and/or topographic conditions, a variation of this requirement may be considered with the payment of in-lieu fees.

Nonself-imposed hardship shall mean the unusual form or shape of a lot, existing rock outcroppings on the property, or other topographic feature desired to be protected, or any site physical circumstance that does not allow the applicant to enjoy the same privileges as neighbors have by planting a tree, and/or a circumstance which negatively affects adjacent properties. Circumstances may also include needed sun exposure, visibility of business signs, and other such fundamental reasons that would not justify the planting of a replacement tree on site. If the trees are found to be diseased, infested or hazardous, then canopy coverage replacement is not activated. Replacement trees and/or in-lieu fees are not required if post-removal tree canopy coverage on the site or parcel will be thirty percent or more.

D. In-Lieu Fees for Trees and Canopy Coverage Replacement. An approval for tree removal under this chapter is conditioned upon the applicant planting, at some location on the subject property, replacement trees and canopy coverage, or as a last resort if all other locations on site are found infeasible, pay in-lieu fees to compensate for the planting and maintenance of those trees by the public works director somewhere else off site.

E. In-Lieu Fee Structure. The applicant shall pay the in-lieu fees in effect at the time as established by city council resolution. In-lieu fees would include a deposit and be based on a cost recovery system for the planting and maintenance of trees and canopy percentage to be planted and/or replaced. The cost recovery system is to be approved by the public works director and/or be based on the tree guide published by the International Society of Arboriculture. The fees shall be deposited in the community tree and forest management account administered by the public works director.

In-lieu fees shall be established by city resolution and include the following:

1. For tree replacements off site; and

2. For canopy coverage replacements in relation to healthy trees removed or to conditions on new development applications.

F. Time Limits for Replacement. Permits for tree removal shall not be issued until five hundred dollars have been deposited with the city to secure the applicant’s obligation of planting the replacement tree, unless the director receives proof that the replacement tree has been planted prior to tree removal or will be planted at the same time as tree removal. If the replacement tree is not planted as required, the city may utilize the money for the expenses (including, but not limited to, staff time) in effecting the planting of the replacement trees.

G. Maintenance of Replacement Trees. Whenever a permit has been issued on the basis that the applicant will be planting a replacement tree, the applicant must agree to maintain those trees, and to refrain from destroying such trees regardless of the size of the tree. If the tree dies, the applicant shall be required to replace the tree as many times as necessary.

H. Tree Removal and Replacement Fees. The applicant shall pay a permit fee for tree removals and in-lieu fees as applicable, and set forth in the city council fee resolution. The fees would include a deposit and would recover all staff costs for processing, planting, and maintaining trees to replace lost canopy coverage. (Ord. 954 § 3, 2011; Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.200 Removal by the city of hazardous trees on private property.
A. Declaration of Public Nuisance. Based on recommendations of the community development director or the public works director, the city council by resolution may declare tree (heritage and non-heritage tree) to be a public nuisance to be abated as set forth in this section if it is found that any tree growing on private property, when infested by any insect or infected by reason of such infestation or infection, endangers the life or growth or healthful existence of other trees within the city not so infested or infected, or any trees determined to be a danger to persons or property.

B. Notice to Abate Public Nuisance. After the passage of such resolution, the community development director shall cause to be conspicuously posted on the property upon which such public nuisance is alleged to exist, not less than ten working days prior to abatement, not less than three notices headed “notice to abate public nuisance,” such heading to be in letters not less than one inch in height and substantially in the following form:

NOTICE TO ABATE PUBLIC NUISANCE

Notice is hereby given that on the _______ day of ________, 20____, the City Council of the City of Capitola passed a resolution declaring that certain (trees) located upon (description of property) are infested with insects, infected with disease, or a clear and present danger to persons or property, and that the same constitute a public nuisance which must be abated by the removal of the same, otherwise they will be removed and the nuisance abated by the City, in which case the cost of such removal shall be assessed upon the property from which such (trees, or other plants) are removed, and such cost will constitute a lien upon such property until paid. Reference is hereby made to said resolution for further particulars.

Any person objecting to the proposed removal, as aforesaid, is hereby notified to attend the meeting of said City Council to be held in the Council Chambers in City Hall at (time) on the _____ day of _____, 20___.

C. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the city, its officers or employees, nor to relieve the owner of any private property from the duty to keep any tree upon his or her property or under his or her control in such a condition as to prevent it from constituting a public nuisance as defined in this section. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.210 Emergency removal.
In the event of an emergency whereby immediate action is required because of disease or because of imminent danger to life or property, a non-heritage and a heritage tree may be pruned, altered or removed by order of the public works director or by order of the police chief. The person ordering the pruning, alteration or removal shall file a report listing findings to justify the tree removal as follows:

A. Removal Findings for Heritage Trees. That the emergency removal of the heritage tree is in the public interest because of the health condition of the tree with respect to disease, infestation, or danger of falling on persons or property; that other feasible and safe alternatives to removal have already been explored or applied and would not or did not resolve the problem; that replacement trees and locations have been identified and scheduled for planting. The report shall also include photos and tree documentation for heritage trees and trees in the sensitive habitat areas.

B. Removal Findings for Non-Heritage Trees. That the emergency removal of non-heritage trees is in the public interest because of the health conditions of the tree with respect to disease, infestation or danger of falling on persons or property; that other feasible and safe alternatives have been evaluated and that replacement trees and locations have been identified and scheduled for planting.

C. The report shall be filed within five days from removal with the community development director. The community development director shall forward copies of the report to the planning commission and council for their information. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.220 Americans with Disabilities Act compliance.
The removal and replacement of any trees, including heritage trees, shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act regulations, such as for path of access and cross slope. This would avoid creating barriers to disabled access. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

Article V. Enforcement and Evaluation

12.12.230 Enforcement.
The community development director is hereby charged with the responsibility for the enforcement of the ordinance codified in this chapter as soon as it is adopted, and may serve notice to any person in violation thereof or institute legal proceedings as may be required, and the city attorney is hereby authorized to institute appropriate proceedings to that tend. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.240 Monitoring conditions of approval.
The community development director and/or designee, with the help of the public works department, shall enforce conditions of approval, monitor replacement tree planting and maintenance to ensure the city regulations are being implemented.

A. Conditions of Approval for Sick and Hazardous Trees. In general the staff member who issues tree permits for sick or hazardous trees will monitor planting and enforce conditions related to those replacement trees planted in the public property.

B. Conditions of Approval for Healthy and Heritage Trees. The community development department staff will monitor planting and enforce conditions related to healthy trees, heritage trees, and for replacement trees planted on private property that were part of a removal permit issued by the public works department staff. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.250 Citizen complaints.
The public works department will respond to citizen complaints regarding dangerous, diseased, and hazardous trees. The community development department will respond to complaints related to illegal removal, harm or excessive pruning and similar problems occurring to healthy trees and heritage trees. When such complaint calls are received during the weekends by the police department, a police officer would inspect the site, order a stop work notice, and report to the community development department staff on the first working day of the week. In case of an emergency situation the officer would follow provisions as stated in Section 12.12.210. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.260 Tree trimmers.
Tree trimmers are required to perform according to city regulations as set forth in this chapter and in the community forest program. Violation of these regulations is reason for revocation of the city permit to operate within Capitola, and removal from the city list of certified tree trimmers and arborists. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.270 Penalty for violation.
A. Criminal Penalty. Any person alone, or through an agent, employee or representative, who violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a separate offense for each act constituting a violation of this chapter. Persons criminally liable for a violation of this chapter include, but are not limited to, a property owner, an arborist, a tree trimming business, or contractor who perform work or cause work to be performed in violation of this chapter. The city attorney shall have the discretion to prosecute any violation of this chapter as either a misdemeanor or an infraction punishable by a fine in the maximum amount authorized by the California Penal Code for misdemeanors and infractions.

B. Civil Penalty. As an alternative to criminally prosecuting violations of this chapter, the city may seek civil penalties as herein below set forth.

1. Non-Heritage Tree Violations.

a. The violation of any provision contained in this chapter is declared to be unlawful and shall constitute a public nuisance, subject to the penalties as prescribed in this chapter. Such penalties may be assessed also against a certified arborist, property owner, or contractor who performed work in violation of this section. In addition thereto, any person unlawfully removing, destroying or damaging any protected tree shall be penalized as follows:

i. Replacing the unlawfully removed tree with one or more new trees which, in the opinion of the community development director or planning commission, will provide equivalent aesthetic quality in terms of size, height, location, appearance, age and other characteristics of the unlawfully removed tree. Such trees shall be located on site where the tree was removed;

ii. Where similar replacement trees will not provide reasonably equivalent aesthetic quality because of the size, height, location, appearance, age and other characteristics of the unlawfully removed or damaged tree at the discretion of the community development director or planning commission, the community development director shall calculate the value of the removed tree in accordance with the latest edition of the Guide for Establishing Values of Trees and Other Plants, as prepared by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. Upon the determination of such value, the community development director may require either a cash payment to the city, and/or the planting of replacement trees as designated by the community development director, or any combination thereof, in accordance with the following:

(A) Cash payment for any portion or all of the value of the removed tree in accordance with this section, and

(B) The replacement of removed trees, the retail costs of such trees, as shown by documentary evidence satisfactory to the community development director, shall be offset against the value of the removed or damaged tree, but no credit shall be given for transportation, installation, maintenance and other costs incidental to the planting and care of the replacement trees;

iii. Where a violation(s) of this section has previously occurred with the same property owner, agent, certified arborist or contractor, or advance knowledge of the requirements of this section have been provided to the property owner, agent certified arborist or contractor, the community development director or planning commission, at their discretion, shall require payment of a double penalty fee pursuant to subsection (B)(1);

iv. All applications and permit fees paid to the city shall be forfeited.

b. In addition to the civil penalty herein above prescribed, the city shall also recover the cost of staff time, attorney fees and court proceedings incurred in connection with the violation.

2. For Heritage Trees. A penalty pursuant to subsection (B)(1) shall be charged. In addition to the penalty herein prescribed, the city shall also recover the cost of staff time, attorney fees and court proceedings incurred in connection with the violation.

C. Restitution. As an alternative, or in addition to criminal or civil penalties the city may require restitution of any person unlawfully removing, destroying or damaging any trees as prohibited in this chapter as follows:

1. Replace the unlawfully removed tree with one or more trees that, in the opinion of the community development director, will provide equivalent aesthetic quality and other values in terms of size, height, location, appearance, age and other characteristics of the unlawfully removed tree. Such trees may be required to be located either on or off site where the tree was removed.

2. Where similar replacement trees cannot be planted on site, in lieu fees shall be paid into the community tree fund to compensate for the planting and maintenance of the tree and the canopy coverage removed.

D. Disqualification. In the event a violation is committed by or under the direction of a certified arborist, a “permitted” tree trimmer or other contractor included in the city’s list, he or she will be removed from the city’s list for a minimum of one year. A person or company may petition to be relisted. The community development director may grant the petition if he or she concludes that the petitioner will follow this chapter’s regulations in the future. (Ord. 954 § 4, 2011; Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.12.280 Performance evaluation.
The community development director may collect and maintain all records and data necessary to objectively evaluate whether progress is being made toward the stated goals of this chapter. Evaluation methods may include, and may not be limited to:

A. Aerial photos taken periodically to develop citywide base maps for canopy coverage evaluation, sensitive habitat zones area evaluation, parks and street/transportation corridor landscaping;

B. An annual summary and analysis of the tree removal and replacement trees planted on lots evaluated, may be prepared by the director at the direction of the planning commission, and may include, but not be limited to the:

1. Canopy coverage removed,

2. Canopy coverage replaced,

3. Flowering trees replaced,

4. Large trees planted, and

5. The amount of in-lieu fees collected over a one to three-year period as specified by the commission. (Ord. 863 § 2, 2004)

12.44.050 Short-term permits.
The city manager shall designate a portion of the boat storage area for short term use. Permits for this short term use will not exceed two weeks in duration. If demand for these spaces exceeds availability, the city manager may promulgate rules to establish a method of allocating the permits. Such rules shall be formulated so as to preserve these spaces for temporary use and to discourage repeat issuance of short term permits to the same user or boat. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

12.44.060 Seasonal permits.
The remainder of the boat storage area shall be utilized for storage of boats which have received a seasonal permit. The number of spaces shall be ten or such other number as the city council may establish hereafter by resolution. If the number of applications for such spaces exceeds the number of spaces, the city manager may devise reasonable rules and procedures to limit the duration of a permit in order to accommodate a greater number of boat users. For instance, if the number of interested and qualified applicants equals twice the number of spaces, those rules could provide that the seasonal permit would be applicable to only one-half of the April 1st – September 1st season. The city manager’s rules may also establish a method for determination of priority of applicants in the selection of time periods. The rules should be designed to prevent a monopolization of the available spaces by a few persons. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

12.44.070 Applications.
Applications for either short term or seasonal permits shall be on such forms as may be designated from time to time by the city manager. Such applications must be accompanied by a current registration and must include the CF number of the boat. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

12.44.080 Fees.
Fees for the permits shall originally be three dollars per day for a short term permit and thirty dollars per month for seasonal permits. These fees may be changed from time to time by city council resolution. The fees shall be limited to the amount necessary for the city to be compensated for regulation and enforcement costs. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

12.44.090 License agreement.
No permit shall be issued until such time as the owner or person validly in possession of the boat (usually written authorization of the owner will be required) has executed a license agreement in such form as the city attorney approves. The license agreement shall specify that the city is not responsible for loss of any kind and that the rights of the licensee are for boat storage of a designated boat only. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

12.44.100 Loss of permit.
The city manager, or his or her designated representative after three days prior written notice, may terminate any permit (and refund on a pro rata basis the permit fee) when:

A. The permit was obtained on the basis of false information;

B. Permittee fails to rig the halyards in such a way as to prevent noise;

C. When there has been a failure to pay the license fees. (Ord. 537 (part), 1983)

*    Prior ordinance history: Ord. 655.

12.56.010 Purpose.
By resolution(s), the city council has determined which streets, or portions thereof, are included within the city’s “street system.” In many parts of the city, the full width of property dedicated to, or acquired by, the city for street and related purposes has not been accepted into the street system. The city council determines that the public welfare would be more harmed than benefited from a complete prohibition of landscaping or other private improvements located within public rights-of-way but not within the street system. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate such areas in a manner that considers views, preserves necessary parking, does not unduly inhibit future widening of the street system, but at the same time allows privately-installed improvements that are not harmful to the integrity and character of the district in which the property is located. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.020 “Street system area” defined.
“Street system area” as used in this chapter means those street rights-of-way or portions thereof which, pursuant to Streets and Highways Code Section 1806 and Capitola resolutions, have been accepted into the city’s street system. Subject to some minor exceptions, the street system area consists of those areas of street rights-of-way which are actually covered by city installed paving, curb, gutter, or sidewalk. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.030 Shoulder parking area.
The public works director may determine the extent of the area, which is adjacent to the street system area and within the right-of-way, and which, in his or her opinion: is appropriate for either public off-street parking; or has a significant possibility of, in the next five-year period, being utilized by the city for street widening or installation of curb, gutter, or sidewalk; or is located over a utility easement. For purposes of this chapter, such areas shall be known as “shoulder parking areas.” Before any private improvement permits (see Section 12.56.060 of this chapter) are issued pursuant to this chapter, the public works director must determine the shoulder parking area for the block of the street in which the property is located. Whenever any such determination is made, the public works director shall file a record of that determination with the city clerk, who shall cause notice of that determination to be given to each city council member. At the request of any council member, the public works director determinations as to the extent of any shoulder parking area may be reviewed by the city council, which may modify any such determinations at any time. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.040 Shoulder parking area improvement permits.
In the shoulder parking areas, permits may be issued for privately installed improvements such as paving, grading or gravel which do not inhibit the use of those areas for parking or street widening.

Such permits may be issued by the planning commission in conjunction with other land development permits; when there is no concurrent developmental applications, they may be issued by the public works director. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.050 Private improvements area defined.
“Private improvements area,” as used in this chapter, means that portion of any public street right-of-way in the city which is neither street system area nor shoulder parking area. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.060 Private improvement permits.
Permits may be issued to allow certain improvements to be installed and maintained by abutting private property owners, within the private improvements area, as provided in this section.

A. Minor Permits. Permits may be issued by the public works director for the following: items allowed in Section 12.56.040 of this chapter; mailboxes determined by the public works director to be of a reasonable size and reasonably located; property boundary fences not in excess of three and one-half feet in height (for a definition of fences, see Municipal Code Section 17.54.010); at-grade walkways and driveways meeting any applicable standard specifications; landscaping approved as part of a landscaping plan which had planning commission or city council review; or landscaping that does not include plants which, at maturity, will exceed three and one-half feet in height nor develop a root system likely to damage streets, sidewalks or adjoining property, nor expensive to remove at maturity.

B. Major Permits Issued by Planning Commission. The planning commission may issue permits for private improvements not issuable under subsection A of this section. The commission’s decision as to whether to issue such permit shall be made by weighing the following considerations: the expense and difficulty that will be entailed in removing the improvement in the event of street widening; whether the proposed improvements are in conformity with the size, scale, and aesthetics of the surrounding neighborhood; preservation of views; and whether granting the permit would tend to result in the granting of a special privilege, in the sense that granting this permit would tend to preclude granting similar permits to neighboring property. If the benefit to the applicant and community is determined to exceed the detriment to the community, the permit shall be approved. The planning commission may, by providing reasonable notice to neighboring property owners, develop standards or criteria applicable to the entire block within which the property is located. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.070 All permits revocable/hold harmless agreements.
Permits issued under this chapter shall include a statement that by accepting such a permit, the permittee and his or her successor agrees to hold the city, its officers, agents and employees, free and harmless from any liability for injuries to persons or property resulting from the construction or maintenance of such private improvement, and also agrees that the removal of the structure, when so ordered by the city, shall be at the permittee’s expense. Such permit shall also provide that upon failure of the permittee to remove such improvement within a reasonable time after notice from the city manager or designee, the same may be abated and removed by the city and the cost thereof made a lien upon the property (see Section 1.01.090 and Title 4 of this code). As a condition of granting any such permit, the city may require execution and recordation of an agreement between the city and the permittee property owner regarding the requirements of this section. However, failure to obtain or record such an agreement shall not free any applicant, owner, or successor from the requirements of this section. (Ord. 955 § 13, 2011; Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.080 State law and uniform codes not affected by this chapter.
This chapter shall not expand or limit the effect of: state law or city ordinances relating to when utilities may install or repair their lines within city easements, Uniform Fire Code access requirements, Uniform Building Code provisions (see Chapters 32 and 33 thereof) regarding air space encroachments above public ways, or Municipal Code Chapter 9.40 which contains prohibitions on signs in rights-of-way. (Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.090 Right-of-way obstructions – Installing private improvements – Prohibition.
A. Except as allowed in this chapter, installing private improvements or otherwise placing obstructions in any public right-of-way is prohibited. For purposes of this chapter, “installing” includes permanent or temporary placing, erecting, constructing, or planting. “Private improvements” means any building, structure, accessory structure, fixture, sign, fence, paving, or landscaping (including trees), or any other object which obstructs all or a portion of any public right-of-way.

B. Exceptions. This section shall not apply to the following cases:

1. Parking of emergency vehicles;

2. Parking of any vehicle in any place where such parking is permitted by law;

3. The city’s placement of structures or barriers for the protection of pedestrians or traffic;

4. The city’s placement of benches;

7. Placement of newsracks in conformity with provisions of this code regulating newsracks on city sidewalks;

8. Placement of trash or other debris in appropriate containers for pickup by the city’s refuse collection franchisee when placed in accordance with the applicable collection schedules.

C. Public Nuisance Declared. If any vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment is placed or left upon any public street, sidewalk, roadway, pedestrian way or bicycle path in the city of Capitola, contrary to the terms of this chapter and without the written permission of the director of public works, any such vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment is declared to be a public nuisance, and the director of public works is hereby authorized and empowered to remove any such vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment from the public street, sidewalk, roadway, pedestrian way or bicycle path forthwith. If the person owning or otherwise responsible for any such vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment is present, then before removing the vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment, the director of public works or the person designated by the superintendent shall warn that person that he or she is in violation of this chapter and shall give that person the opportunity to remove forthwith the vehicle, object, structure, construction material or construction equipment. (Ord. 974 § 1, 2012; Ord. 854 § 1, 2003; Ord. 796, 1997)

12.56.100 Miscellaneous.
A. Whenever an application is made pursuant to this chapter, the city may require of the applicant such title or survey information as is reasonably necessary to respond to the application.

13.12.010 Findings.
The city council of the city makes the following findings:

A. The residents of the city face the certainty of continued escalating prices for home energy supplies and continued dependence upon imported sources of energy.

B. Solar energy has been found to be an inexhaustible, reliable and nonpolluting energy resource that can contribute to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by lessening dependence upon nonrenewable and imported sources of energy.

C. The high initial cost of purchasing and installing a solar energy device is the primary economic barrier to expanded solar energy use. Leasing of solar energy devices has proven to be an effective means to reduce this economic barrier and may be an attractive economic alternative to ownership for many consumers.

D. Under Section 17052.5 of the State Revenue and Taxation Code, California taxpayers who partially own and partially lease on premises a solar energy system from a municipal utility or any lessor granted a permit for municipal solar utility established by ordinance of the local jurisdiction prior to January 1, 1983, are eligible to claim the California Solar Tax Credit, thus the need for an immediately effective ordinance.

E. The establishment of a municipal solar utility program can increase public awareness of solar energy alternatives and lead to a greater degree of consumer protection and consumer confidence in leasing solar energy systems, thus substantially increasing the use of solar energy within the city. (Ord. 531 § 1, 1982)

13.12.020 Intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to establish a municipal solar utility within the city, for the purpose of satisfying the requirements contained in Section 17052.5 or Section 23601 of the California Revenue and Tax Code, and for the purpose of facilitating the leasing of solar energy devices and to establish regulating authority for any solar leasing operation that may be conducted under the program. (Ord. 531 § 2, 1982)

13.12.030 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them by this section:

A. “Municipal solar utility (MSU)” means a program conducted by the city or its authorized agent to promote the utilization of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies through leasing of solar energy systems as provided by Revenue Taxation Code, Section 17052.5.

B. “Solar energy system” means equipment and materials that are intended to be located on or affixed to real property for the purpose of any of the following:

1. Domestic, recreational, therapeutic, or service water heating;

2. Space conditioning;

3. Production of electricity;

4. Process heat;

5. Solar mechanical energy; and

6. Wind energy for the production of electricity or mechanical work.

The term “solar energy system” includes, but is not limited to, passive thermal systems, semipassive thermal systems, active thermal systems, photovoltaic systems and wind-driven systems.

C. “Solar lease” means a contract for the leasing of solar energy systems owned by the lessor and used by the lessee, which are affixed to, or located at, and servicing the real property owned, or occupied by the lessee.

D. “Solar lessor” means any individual or entity arranging, pursuant to a lease, for installation and servicing of solar energy systems. (Ord. 531 § 3, 1982)

13.12.040 Regulation of solar leasing operations.
A. No individual or entity shall operate as a certified solar lessor under the municipal solar utility program of the city as established in this chapter without having obtained a valid solar leasing permit from the city planning department. Such a permit shall authorize the conduct of solar leasing operations under the municipal solar utility program for a period of one year and shall be renewable.

B. After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and within forty-five days after receiving the first written request from a solar lessor for a solar leasing permit, the city council shall by resolution establish all requirements for obtaining certification under the municipal solar utility program. Such requirements shall be limited to those which protect consumers against inexperienced or financially unstable solar leasing companies, substandard equipment or installation practices, or unfair lease arrangements. (Ord. 531 § 4, 1982)

13.12.050 Fees.
Reasonable fees shall be charged to cover the costs of administering this chapter and may be established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 531 § 5, 1982)

13.12.060 Appeal.
An applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the planning department may appeal the decision to the city council. (Ord. 531 § 6, 1982)

The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described in the Phase II MS4 permit.

Conditionally exempted discharges are explicitly detailed in Section B3 of the Phase II MS4 permit. It is the responsibility of the discharger to review the list of exemptions in the Phase II MS4 permit to verify compliance with the permit and applicability of the exemption for the proposed discharge. Examples of exempted discharges include, but are not limited to, water line flushing, individual residential car washing, air conditioning condensation, and discharges from potable water sources. This provision does not obviate the need to obtain any other appropriate permits for such discharges. Any exempted discharges determined to be a significant source of pollutants to the MS4 or receiving waters are prohibited.

B. Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

1. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.

2. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.

5. Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the city requiring that such locating be completed.

Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified.

Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the city.

C. Incidental Discharge Prohibition and Prevention.

1. Non-storm-water runoff discharge that is not incidental is prohibited, unless otherwise specified in the Phase II MS4 permit.

2. Discharges in excess of an amount deemed to be incidental runoff shall be controlled. Water leaving an intended use area is not considered incidental if it is part of the facility design, if it is due to excessive application, if it is due to intentional overflow or application, or if it is due to negligence.

3. Parties responsible for controlling runoff in excess of incidental runoff shall do so in accordance with the Phase II MS4 permit. (Ord. 985 § 1 (part), 2013)

13.16.080 Suspension of MS4 access.
A. Emergency Cease and Desist Orders.

1. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and that the person’s violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the city may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:

a. Immediately comply with all requirements of this chapter; and

b. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

2. Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge in accordance with the following requirements, and as detailed in the order:

a. Abate and clean up their discharge, spill, or pollutant release within seventy-two hours of notification.

b. Clean up high risk spills as soon as possible.

c. Uncontrolled sources of pollutants that may pose an environmental threat shall be abated within thirty days of notification. “Uncontrolled sources of pollutants” refers to any facilities, equipment, materials or other objects that contain or consist of pollutants that may pose an environmental threat and that have not been adequately controlled or contained with BMPs to prevent those pollutants from entering the MS4 and/or waters of the U.S. The proximity of the source to a drain inlet or a waterway, the potential pathways and barriers, and potential entrainment of the source and/or pollutants in storm water via rain events are all considerations for determining whether a source requires abatement and shall be left to the discretion of the inspector.

3. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including seeking termination of a facility’s utility services.

The city may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter.

A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within thirty days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.

B. Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations.

1. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States.

If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

C. Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.

1. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing.

2. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. (Ord. 985 § 1 (part), 2013)

The city finds that green building design, construction and operation can have a significant positive effect on energy and resource efficiency, waste and pollution generation, and the health and productivity of a building’s occupants over the life of the building. The second purpose is to create healthy work and living environments increasing the productivity of workers and residents and visitors to the city by improving indoor air quality and lighting.

The intent of this chapter is to help promote the environmental sustainability of natural resources and improvement of the interior environment by efficiently redirecting the use of recyclable materials away from landfills, by introducing recycled content and materials created with low embodied energy materials in construction, and by reducing the energy consumption needs of structures by making use of efficient construction methods.

The city also finds that green design and construction decisions made by the city in the construction and remodeling of city buildings can result in significant cost savings to the city over the life of the buildings. The city also recognizes that it must lead by example in order to have the general populace follow suit and therefore commits itself to the practice of green building for all new and remodeling construction on city owned buildings and structures.

The city additionally finds that water conservation, storm water pollution prevention, and greenhouse gas reductions advance the city’s general plan goals to promote resource conservation, clean and healthy air and water, and overall environmental sustainability.

15.20.010 Statutory authorization. Revised 6/18
The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Capitola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.020 Findings of fact. Revised 6/18
The flood hazard areas of the city of Capitola are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.030 Statement of purpose. Revised 6/18
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.040 Methods of reducing flood losses. Revised 6/18
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.050 Abrogation and greater restrictions. Revised 6/18
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.060 Interpretation. Revised 6/18
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.070 Warning and disclaimer of liability. Revised 6/18
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Capitola, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.080 Severability. Revised 6/18
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.090 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. Revised 6/18
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated June 3, 1986, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) dated June 3, 1986, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMS and FBFMs are on file at 420 Capitola Avenue, city of Capitola. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

Building. See “Structure.”

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 14, 1984.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, either final site grading or pouring of concrete pads, or the construction of streets).

“Flood,” “flooding” or “floodwater” means:

1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

2. The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

“Flood Hazard Boundary Map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See “Flood.”

“Floodplain administrator” is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain area” means the land on either side of a creek or other watercourse which may be subject to flooding. “Floodplain area” includes the one-hundred-year floodplain as determined by the Federal Flood Insurance Program and shown on both the Flood Insurance Rate Map and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, each dated June 3, 1986.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, when possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

“Flood-related erosion area” means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water which, due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

“Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway encroachment lines” means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps.

“Floodway fringe” is the area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization” means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city of Capitola will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use, the intended purpose of which cannot be performed unless the use is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo and passengers, and ship-building and ship-repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Habitable floor” means floors usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating or recreation, or combination thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a habitable floor.

“Hardship” means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city of Capitola requires that the variance must be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbor likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of the structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “basement” definition).

1. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

a. The flood openings standard in Section 15.20.160(C)(3);

b. The anchoring standards in Section 15.20.160(A);

c. The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.20.160(B); and

d. The standards for utilities in Section 15.20.170.

2. For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “basement” definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Market value” is defined in the city of Capitola substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 15.20.120(B)(1).

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“Mudslide” describes a condition where there is river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.

“Mudslide prone area” means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

“New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after August 14, 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 14, 1984.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protective, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

One-Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year-Flood. See “Base flood.”

“Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.

“Program deficiency” means a defect in a community’s floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations.

“Public safety and nuisance” as related to Section 15.20.230 means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

Sheet Flow Area. See “Area of shallow flooding.”

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood, mudslide or flood-related erosion hazards and shown on the FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, E. M. V1-V30, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

V Zone. See “Coastal high hazard area.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain or coastal or riverine areas. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.110 Designation of the floodplain administrator. Revised 6/18
The building official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.120 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. Revised 6/18
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

A. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

1. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

2. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Capitola; and

5. All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

C. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.20.090, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 15.20.160 through 15.20.220.

Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.

D. Notification of Other Agencies.

1. Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

c. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

2. Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

a. Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

b. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

3. Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

E. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

1. Certification required by Section 15.20.160(C)(1) and Section 15.20.190 (lowest floor elevations);

2. Certification required by Section 15.20.160(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);

3. Certification required by Section 15.20.160(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard);

4. Certification of elevation required by Section 15.20.180(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards);

15.20.210 Standards within floodways. Revised 6/18
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Capitola.

B. Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Capitola shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

C. If subsections A and B of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.20.160 through 15.20.220. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.220 Coastal high hazard areas. Revised 6/18
Within coastal high hazard areas, zones V, V1-30, and VE, as established under Section 15.20.090, the following standards shall apply:

A. All new residential and nonresidential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.

B. All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.

C. All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Section 15.20.100. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

D. Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.

E. Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

F. The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

2. The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.230 Variance procedure. Revised 6/18
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city of Capitola to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.240 Conditions for variances. Revised 6/18
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; provided, that the procedures of Sections 15.20.110 through 15.20.150 and 15.20.160 through 15.20.220 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Section 15.20.100) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary,” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city of Capitola need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city of Capitola believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Santa Cruz County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.250 Approval of variances. Revised 6/18
A. In passing upon requests for variances, the city of Capitola shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

1. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B. Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and

3. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance” (Section 15.20.100)), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

C. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A, B and D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.20.240(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city of Capitola may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.260 Nonconforming structures in floodplain. Revised 6/18
A structure which was lawful before enactment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued as a nonconforming structure subject to the following condition: If any nonconforming structure is destroyed by flood, earthquake, tsunami or for another cause to the extent of fifty percent or more of its fair market value immediately prior to the destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.270 Variance appeal procedure. Revised 6/18
A. Appeal procedure for all decisions made under this chapter shall be in conformance with standard appeal procedures of Chapter 2.52 of this code.

B. The director of public works shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.

C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted should be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built in variance with these rules and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from such variance. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

15.20.280 Disclosure requirement. Revised 6/18
A person who is acting as an agent for a seller of real property which is located within an area of special flood hazard, or the seller if he or she is acting without an agent, shall disclose to any prospective purchaser the fact that the property is located within an area of special flood hazard. The community development director may adopt methods of informing owners and real estate sales persons of this requirement. (Ord. 1017 § 5 (Exh. C) (part), 2018)

If the permittee is unable to complete the work within the specified time, he or she shall, prior to the expiration of the permit, present in writing a request for an extension of time, setting forth the reasons for the requested extension. If in the opinion of the grading official an extension is warranted, additional time may be granted for the completion of the work. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.070 Fees.
Fees, if any, necessary to implement this chapter shall be as set forth by city council resolution. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.080 Bonds.
The grading official may require bonds in such form and amounts as may be deemed necessary to assure that the work, if not completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, will be done. In lieu of surety bond, the applicant may file a cash bond or instrument of credit with the grading official in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.090 Design standards for cut and excavations.
A. Generally. Unless otherwise recommended in the soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports approved by the grading official, cuts and excavations shall conform to the provisions of this section.

B. Slope. The slope of cut surface shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Cut slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and shall not exceed twenty feet in vertical height or exceed seventy-five feet slope (horizontal) distance without a bench or terrace break. Due to individual site soils and geology, flatter and shorter slope lengths may be required, or steeper and longer slope lengths may be allowed upon review by the grading official when he or she finds this consistent with the building and safety. Cut slopes shall be rounded off so as to blend in with natural terrain. (See Figure 2 of Ordinance 511.)

C. Stockpiles. Stockpile material for trenches and pits will be put upslope of the excavation to be promptly backfilled and compacted into trenches and pits. Excavated material not needed at the site will be removed or disposed of at a location approved by the grading official.

D. Vegetative Protection. All earth cuts shall be planted or otherwise protected from the storm runoff erosion within thirty days of the completion of final erosion control and grading work. Planting shall be irrigated to establish a root system before the rainy season, if necessary in the opinion of the grading official. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.100 Design standards for fill.
A. Generally. Unless otherwise recommended in the soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports approved by the grading official, fill shall conform to the provisions of this section.

B. Fill Location. Fill shall not be constructed on natural slopes steeper than two to one unless an engineer devises a method of placement which will ensure the fill will remain in place. The toe of the fill shall be no closer than twelve feet horizontally to the top of existing or planned cut slopes. The area beyond the toe of the fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a drain shall be provided. (See Figure 3 of Ordinance 511.)

C. Fill Slopes. The slope of fill surfaces can be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Fill slopes shall be no steeper than two to one and shall not exceed twenty feet vertical height or seventy-five feet slope (horizontal) distance without a terrace break. Due to individual soil properties, shorter and flatter slopes may be required or steeper and longer slopes may be allowed upon review by the grading official if he or she finds the deviations consistent with stability and safety. Fill slopes shall be rounded off so as to blend with the natural terrain. (See Figure 2 of Ordinance 511.)

D. Ground Preparation. Natural ground surface over which fills are planned shall first be cleaned of all trash, vegetation, stumps, debris, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable materials and shall be scarified prior to the placement of the fill. Where slopes are five to one or steeper, a key, ten feet wide minimum, shall be dug into undisturbed, solid competent soil or bedrock beneath the toe of the proposed fill. The key must be cut and approved as a suitable foundation for fill before placing any fill. (See Figures 1 and 3 of Ordinance 511.)

E. Materials Permitted. Only earth material free from tree stumps, detrimental amounts of organic matter, trash, garbage, sod, peat and/or similar materials shall be used. Rocks and/or broken concrete larger than six inches in greatest dimension shall not be used unless the method of placement is approved by the grading official. Topsoil may be used in the top twelve-inch surface layer to aid in planting and landscaping.

F. Compaction of Fill. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum relative dry density of ninety percent as determined by ASTM D-1557-78 or CALTRANS test method under California 216. Field density verification must be submitted for any fill twelve inches or more in depth where such fill may support the foundation for a structure. A higher relative dry density and/or additional compaction tests may be required at any time by the grading official.

G. Vegetative Protection. All earth fill shall be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm runoff within thirty days of the completion of final grading and planting shall be irrigated to establish a root system, if necessary in the opinion of the grading official. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.110 Design standards for cut and fill setbacks.
A. Generally. Unless otherwise recommended in the approved soil engineering and/or engineering geology reports and shown on the approved grading plan, setbacks shall conform to this section and be no less than as shown in Figure 4 of Ordinance 511.

B. Minimum Setbacks. Tops and toes of cut and filled slopes shall be set back from property boundaries and structures as far as necessary for the safety of the adjacent properties and to prevent damage resulting from water runoff, by flooding, erosion of the slopes, orby sediment deposition. (See Figure 4 of Ordinance 511.)

C. Stream and Riparian Setbacks. Tops and toes of cut and/or filled slopes shall be set back far enough to prevent encroachment upon streams, floodplains, channels, or bodies of standing water and to provide and maintain an undisturbed protective strip between the grading and the riparian corridor. This strip shall have sufficient filter capacity as determined by the grading official to prevent degradation of water quality. If it is determined that the filter capacity of the protective strip is insufficient, additional erosion control may be required by increasing the width of the protective strip or with structural measures and/or by seeding, planting, mulching of bare soil areas.

D. Retaining Walls. Retaining walls when keyed into stable foundations and capable of sustaining the design loads, may be used to reduce the required cut and fill setbacks when recommended by the civil or soil engineers, or geologist and approved by the grading official. Other restrictions and/or minimums may be increased or relaxed upon review by the grading official if he or she finds the deviations consistent with safety and stability and to provide access for slope maintenance and drainageways. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.120 Design standards for drainage and terraces.
A. Generally. Drainage facilities and terraces shall conform to the provisions of this section-unless otherwise indicated on the approved permit and plans. To the greatest extent possible, peak storm drainage runoff and sediment rates may not exceed predevelopment rates. A pro rata share of the cost of offsite erosion sediment, and flood-control improvements and/or for maintenance to the principal drainageway may be required by the grading official to handle the increased peak runoff and/or sediment generated by the development if greater than predevelopment rates.

B. Runoff Calculations. Plans and specifications prepared for subdivisions of five acres or more shall show, by table and/or calculations, the peak rates of storm runoff both before and after development. A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff may be required.

C. Drainage Facilities.

1. Disturbance of natural drainageways shall be kept to a minimum and existing drainage courses shall not be obstructed or obliterated without mitigating measures installed that have been approved by the grading official.

2. Whenever a grading operation obstructs or impairs the flow of runoff in an existing drainage course, a culvert, bridge or other suitable drainage facility designed and acceptable to the grading official shall be installed to convey the flow past the point of impairment. No construction materials or construction byproducts shall be discarded in any drainageway or riparian zone.

3. Drainage facilities shall be culverts, pipe drains, paved, rock, or vegetative channels designed to safely carry existing and potential offsite runoff from a fully developed area upstream as well as local onsite surface and subsurface waters to the nearest adequate drainage course designated for such purposes by the grading official. Properly designed energy dissipators are required at the point of discharge.

4. Culvert size and industry standard materials shall be used in accordance with city standard design criteria and as approved by the grading official. Minimum diameter shall be twelve inches.

5. Cuts, fills, and retaining walls shall have subsurface drainage facilities as necessary for stability.

6. Berms, ditches, interceptor drains, or swales, shall be constructed at the top of cut and fill slopes when necessary for protection against water runoff. Minimum size interceptor drains above cut slopes with a tributary drainage area greater than forty feet measured horizontally or an area larger than one-third acre shall be paved with three inches of reinforced concrete or gunite and shall be twelve inches deep with thirty-six inches paved width and discharge into downdrain. Energy dissipators may be required by the grading official.

7. At least a one percent grade will be required toward an improved storm drainage facility, either existing or planned, from all building sites, pads, yards, roof drains, driveways, and etc.

8. Grading equipment shall not disturb or cross flowing streams unless absolutely necessary and only with prior approval from the grading official. The California Department of Fish and Game shall be consulted and appropriate permits obtained for any activities undertaken in areas subject to their jurisdiction.

D. Terraces.

1. Terraces at least six feet in width shall be established at not more than twenty-foot vertical intervals or seventy-five-foot slope horizontal intervals. Suitable access shall be provided to permit proper grading and maintenance of these terraces. Where only one terrace is required, it shall be at mid height. (See Figure-4 of Ordinance 511.)

2. Swales or interceptor pipes or drains, ditches, on terraces and on the top of cut slopes, shall be designed to carry water and sediment to safe disposal structures and areas and shall have a minimum gradient of one percent and must be paved with concrete or gunite not less than three inches in thickness or other paved or vegetative approved nonerodible surface. They shall have a minimum depth of one foot and a minimum paved or protected area of five feet. (See Figure 4 of Ordinance 511.) A revegetation and maintenance plan may be required by the grading official. (Ord. 677 § 9(C), 1989; Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

15.28.130 Design standards for erosion and sediment control.
A. Generally. Buildings and access envelopes shall be delineated on the development plans when necessary to keep disturbance out of particularly erodible areas. New lots shall not be created which will require access road and driveways to cross slopes exceeding fifty percent (two to one) for distances greater than fifty feet. Exposed soil shall be protected from erosion by temporary and/or permanent measures. Such protection may consist of mulching, plastic sheeting, and/or vegetation.

B. Slope. Structures on existing slopes exceeding thirty percent shall utilize pole, step or other such foundation that does not require major excavations or fillings. (See Figure 3 of Ordinance 511.)

C. Runoff Control. Where concentrated runoff will occur, it will be carried in pipe or culvert conduits or over a nonerodible surface (paved, rocked, or vegetated) with discharge points clearly shown on the development plans. All conduits must have proper energy dissipators at the point of discharge when necessary to prevent erosion.

D. Building Site Runoff. Runoff from buildings, roads, driveways and the total site area shall be controlled by berms, swales, ditches, structures, vegetative filter strips and/or catchbasins to prevent the escape of sediment from the site.

E. Vegetative Removal. Development plans shall indicate the areas where vegetation is to be removed and replaced within the building and access envelopes. Vegetation removal shall be limited to that amount necessary to conduct the permitted activity and as indicated on the approved development plan. The method and time shall be such that the erosive effects are minimized. When work is allowed, native groundcover shall not be cleared, destroyed, burned, or disturbed more than fifteen days prior to grading or construction work unless approved in advance by the grading official.

F. Vegetative Disposal. Vegetation removed during clearing operations shall be disposed of by chipping, used as mulch, compost, and/or by burning. Burning shall comply with local air quality standards and no long branches or charred pieces shall be permitted to remain.

G. Topsoil. To promote regrowth of vegetation, the topsoil shall be stockpiled and reapplied upon completion of grading on slopes of less than five-to-one (twenty percent). Soil stockpiles and exposed soil shall be protected from erosion at all times.

H. Temporary Vegetation. Temporary vegetation sufficient to stabilize the soil as permanent vegetation cover is maturing shall be established on all disturbed areas as needed and as each stage of grading is completed.

I. Winter Operations – October 15th to April 15th.

1. Land disturbance or development operations may be restricted or temporarily halted between October 15th and April 15th (the normal rainy season), and/or other times whenever the grading official determines that the weather, soil, slope and general site conditions may cause serious accelerated erosion or sediment damage either onsite or downstream.

2. When land development work is allowed during the normal, rainy winter season, adequate erosion and sediment control measures must be in place during any land disturbance, and temporary erosion control measures must be applied to all soils bared at the end of each day.

3. During winter, sufficient erosion control materials of straw, plastic, netting, etc., shall be kept on the site at all times to be installed immediately by the permittee upon advent of any rainfall or wind that may be expected to cause accelerated erosion.

4. All cut and fill slopes without established vegetation between October 15th and April 15th shall be mulched. The mulching shall be anchored by punching or tacking into the soil or by the use of netting. A minimum of one thousand pounds of straw, or equivalent, per each ten thousand square feet of slope surface will be required to be anchored. Any additional amount may be required by the grading official.

5. Within ten working days after seeding, fertilizing and/or mulching, the permittee will commence irrigation of the seeded areas or slopes and shall continue until the rains come and/or the groundcover is fully developed. Berms, diversion catchbasins, etc., shall be installed prior to seeding and mulching.

6. All erosion control plantings and mulching shall be closely monitored throughout the winter and runoff problems corrected promptly. All erosion and/or slippage of banks shall be repaired by the permittee at his or her expense.

J. Dust. Dust from grading operations must be controlled. The permittee may be required to keep adequate equipment on the grading site to prevent dust problems.

K. Erosion Control Coordination with Project Installation.

1. All vegetative and/or structural measures required to safely discharge any accelerated runoff generated by the project shall be installed during the first or initial construction phase of the project.

2. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size which can be completed in a single construction season. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be coordinated with a sequence of grading, development, and construction operations and all necessary erosion control measures shall be put in effect prior to the commencement of the next work increment and/or winter rainy season.

3. Prior to completion and final acceptance of the project, all erosion control measures must be in place and all exposed bare soil shall be mulched, fertilized and otherwise prepared so that it is planted to a permanent vegetative cover. Native or naturalized vegetation should be used. The grading official may require watering of planted areas to initiate and assure growth.

L. Livestock. Where necessary to assure that water quality is not affected by the keeping of livestock, vegetative buffer and/or filter strips shall be established on all downhill sides of areas where livestock are kept. The width of the buffer strip shall be determined by the grading official. Also, additional erosion control measures, such as diversion, dissipators and sediment basins may be required to control runoff from these areas where livestock have destroyed and torn up protective vegetation.

M. Maintenance. All onsite erosion control facilities shall be properly maintained by the owners for the life of the project so that they do not become nuisances with stagnant water, heavy algae growth, insect breeding, odors, discarded debris, and/or safety hazards. Vegetative maintenance required may include mowing, fertilization, irrigation and/or reseeding. (Ord. 511 § 2 (part), 1981)

16.68.010 Purpose.
A. This chapter is enacted to establish requirements and procedures for the control and approval of conversion of existing multifamily rental housing and nonresidential structures to residential condominium and community apartment projects. By their unique character and requirements, conversions differ specifically from other subdivisions and apartments. The unique status of such projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to a point where public health, safety, welfare, and economic prosperity of the city of Capitola are significantly affected. Such projects may conflict with the policy of the city as set forth in the general plan to provide a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing within the city, to provide a variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and location of housing and to maintain the supply of rental housing for low and moderate income persons and families.

B. To insure that such problems are avoided in both the short and long term, it is the express intent of the city to treat such projects differently from multiple-family dwellings or other projects which are not residential condominium or community apartment projects and to establish rules and standards thereto regulating the conversion to residential condominium or community apartment projects in the city.

C. This chapter is enacted to insure that proposed conversions are approved consistent with policies and objectives of the city, particularly as follows:

1. To make adequate provisions for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community;

2. To facilitate inhabitant ownership of residential units while recognizing the need for maintaining adequate rental housing inventories;

3. To provide a reasonable balance of rental and ownership housing;

4. To inform prospective conversion purchasers regarding the physical conditions of the structure offered for purchase. (Ord. 460 (part), 1979)

16.68.020 Compliance with Government Code.
A. The city shall comply with Government Code Section 66427.1 in its present form and as hereafter amended.

B. The city shall comply with Government Code Section 66427.2 in its present form and as hereafter amended. This section provides in abbreviated form that without general or specific plan provision containing definite objectives, the city may not reject condominium conversions for failure to comply with the general plan or on the basis of one of the Government Code Section 66474 findings, justifying disapproval. Reference should be made to the full statute for particulars. (Ord. 460 §§ 1.1 and 1.2, 1979)

The city also finds that green design and construction decisions made by the city in the construction and remodeling of city buildings can result in significant cost savings to the city over the life of the buildings. The city also recognizes that it must lead by example in order to have the general populace follow suit and therefore commits itself to the practice of green building for all new and remodeling construction on city owned buildings and structures.

The city additionally finds that water conservation, storm water pollution prevention, and greenhouse gas reductions advance the city’s general plan goals to promote resource conservation, clean and healthy air and water, and overall environmental sustainability.

17.20.090    Findings.

17.20.010 Purpose.
A. The affordable housing overlay (AHO) district is intended to facilitate the provision of affordable housing units as defined in Section 17.20.030 through the retention and rehabilitation of existing units, or the construction of new units. The AHO district is intended to provide the opportunity and means for the city to meet its regional fair share allotment of such units, and to implement the policies and goals of the housing element of the city’s general plan.

B. These regulations are intended to encourage the development of affordable housing units by assisting both the public and private sector in making the provision of these units economically viable, while providing assurances to the city that these units will maintain a high degree of quality and will remain affordable to the target population over a reasonable duration of time.

C. These regulations are further intended to encourage the provision of affordable housing through the combination of the AHO district with multiple-family residential zoning districts within the city where the affordable housing projects are determined to be feasible and are consistent with the city’s general plan.

D. The affordable housing overlay provides a density increase for affordable housing development that in most cases exceeds density bonuses permitted by state law (Government Code Section 65915). Consequently, a development may utilize the affordable housing overlay as an alternative to the use of state density bonus but may not utilize both the affordable housing overlay and state density bonuses.

E. The affordable housing overlay is intended to provide a means of directing and simplifying the process for creating and maintaining affordable housing.

F. The affordable housing overlay is also intended to provide incentives to developers whether in new or rehabilitated housing, to maintain rental units for the long term, e.g., not less than fifty-five years, and affordable ownership units in perpetuity. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.020 Applicability.
The regulations set forth in this chapter may be applied to specific sites meeting the following criteria:

A. Be located in the multiple-family residential zoning districts;

B. Is not located in the R-1 zoning district;

C. One acre in size. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.030 Definitions.
A. “Affordable housing” means housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with “very low,” “low,” or “moderate” income levels at an “affordable housing cost” or “affordable rent,” as those terms are defined by the state of California.

B. “Affordable housing overlay district” means a zoning district that applies in addition to existing zoning designation where the city encourages the provision of affordable housing units as described in this chapter.

C. The “very low,” “low,” and “moderate” income levels are defined by the state of California in Sections 50105, 50079.5, and 50093, respectively, of the California Health and Safety Code, and in Subchapter 2 of Chapter 6.5 of Division 1 of Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 6900. These income levels are:

1. Very Low Income. Up to and including fifty percent of the Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by the state law;

2. Lower Income. Fifty-one percent to eighty percent of Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by the state law;

3. Moderate Income. Eighty-one percent to one hundred twenty percent of Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by state law.

D. “Affordable housing cost” and “affordable rent” are defined in Sections 50052.5 and 50053, respectively, of the California Health and Safety Code, and in Subchapter 2 of Chapter 6.5 of Division 1 of Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 6900.

E. All of the state laws and regulations referenced above, or their successors, as the same from time to time may be amended, are incorporated herein as though fully set forth. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the income and affordability levels set forth in this chapter and the levels set in state laws and regulations, the state provisions shall control. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.040 Uses permitted with a development agreement.
The following uses are permitted with the execution of a development agreement by the city and the developer in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 65864 et seq.

A. Residential developments at a density greater than normally permitted by the underlying, multiple-family zoning district (up to twenty units per acre), when the development provides a substantial level of affordable housing units, as defined in Section 17.20.030. A substantial level is defined herein as a minimum of fifty percent of the units in the project be income restricted affordable housing, of which, no less than fifty percent of those units (twenty-five percent of the total) shall be affordable to households earning low, very low and extremely low incomes. A greater level of affordability will not allow a greater level of density. The twenty units/acre limit shall be based on a calculation that includes all existing and all new units on the land area that is being included in the calculation.

B. Accessory uses or structures incidental to the principally permitted use. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.050 Development incentives.
A. General. In order to reduce costs associated with the development and construction of affordable housing, the property development standards set forth in subsection C of this section are established for the AHO district. These property development standards represent a relaxation of standards normally applied to housing in the city and are established in order to facilitate and promote the development of affordable housing in the city and shall be extended upon issuance of a design permit for architectural and site review. As a further inducement to the development of affordable housing beyond the relaxation and flexibility of development standards, the city, where appropriate, may also extend one or more of the development incentives set forth in subsection D, the selection of which shall depend on the quality, size, nature, and scope of the project being proposed. Incentives shall be targeted to improve the project design or to yield the greatest number of affordable units and required level of affordability, so as to permit the city to meet its regional fair share allotment of affordable housing and the goals of the housing element of the city’s general plan. It is also the intent of the city to facilitate affordable housing by encouraging developer involvement with the city’s redevelopment agency and other public and private entities concerned with the provision of affordable housing and by cooperating with such entities.

B. Eligibility. To be eligible for the property development standards set forth in subsection C of this section requires the developer to propose a housing development containing at least fifty percent affordable units. All affordable units can be in a single category or there can be a mixture of affordable unit types (although twenty-five percent of total must be affordable to low, very low or extremely low income households) which include:

1. Moderate income households; or

2. Lower income households; or

3. Very low income households; or

4. Extremely low income households.

C. Property Development Standards. The following development standards shall apply to affordable housing units in the AHO district:

1. General Design Standards. The affordable housing units shall be designed and developed in a manner compatible with and complementary to existing and potential development in the immediate vicinity of the project site. Site planning on the perimeter shall provide for protection of the property from adverse surrounding influences and shall protect surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences from the property. To the greatest extent possible, the design of the development shall promote privacy for residents and neighbors, security, and use of passive solar heating and cooling through proper placement of walls, windows, and landscaping. Building design and materials shall blend with the neighborhood or existing structures on the site.

2. Minimum Design Standards. Unless modified by the planning commission, the following design standards shall apply to a project that utilizes the density increases allowed by this section.

a. The front facade and main entrance of dwellings adjacent to the front property line shall face the street and must be clearly articulated through the use of architectural detailing.

b. The front entrance of the dwelling facing the street should be defined by at least one of the following: a porch of at least eight feet in width and depth, roof overhang, or similar architectural element.

c. Except for a basement-level garage below grade, any garage, carport or other accessory structure, attached or detached, shall be located at least fifteen feet behind the front of the principal building facing the front property line.

d. Sidewalks shall be installed along all street frontages.

e. Existing vegetation on perimeter shall be preserved to maintain a buffer to existing surrounding structures. Existing significant trees are to remain whenever feasible.

f. The planning commission may waive, or modify, any, or all, of these requirements when the commission finds it is infeasible to comply due to physical or other constraints on the lot.

3. Minimum Building Site Area and Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit. There shall be no minimum building site area requirement for individual lots or individual dwelling sites in an affordable housing development. The building site area shall be designated on a site plan approved by the planning commission pursuant to Chapter 17.63, Architectural and Site Review.

4. Density. In multiple-family residential districts, overall density of site development within an AHO district shall not exceed twenty units per acre. A development may utilize the affordable housing overlay as an alternative to the use of state density bonus but may not utilize both the affordable housing overlay and state density bonuses. Density averaging may be used to achieve an overall acceptable density level for a project. As used herein, “density averaging” means meeting the density requirements by averaging the density on a project-wide basis so as to permit higher density levels in certain project portions in exchange for advantageous project design features. In all zoning districts, density permitted by the AHO district shall not exceed what can be accommodated by the site while meeting parking, unit size, and other development standards.

5. Building Height. The building height shall not exceed two-stories or twenty-seven feet from existing grade or finish grade, whichever is more restrictive.

6. Setbacks. The minimum setbacks from the lot line of the project shall be determined through approval of a design permit/architectural and site review with the exception of setbacks from property lines adjacent to R-1 zoned property, which shall be a minimum of twenty feet for first floors and fifty feet for second floors.

7. Lot Coverage. The maximum lot coverage for a proposed project shall be determined through the design permit/architectural and site review.

8. Parking. R-1 parking standards shall apply with a minimum two spaces per unit. In addition, a minimum of one visitor parking space for every seven units shall be required.

9. Common Open Space. Common open space shall comprise the greater of: (a) ten percent of the total area of the site; or (b) seventy-five square feet for each dwelling unit. Land occupied by buildings, streets, driveways, parking spaces, utility units, and trash enclosures shall not be counted in satisfying the open space requirement; land in landscaping and passive and active recreation/open space with a minimum depth/width of five feet shall be counted, and land occupied by recreational buildings and structures shall be counted.

10. Streets. All public streets within or abutting the proposed planned development shall be dedicated and improved to city specifications for the particular classification of street; all private streets shall meet fire code and access standards.

11. Accessory Uses and Structures. Accessory uses and structures shall be located as specified on the site plan as approved by the planning commission.

12. Signs. Signs shall be permitted only to the extent allowed under Chapter 17.57 and must be approved by the planning commission.

D. Additional Development Incentives. In addition to the relaxed and flexible development standards set forth in subsection C of this section, the city may offer other development incentives should the developer meet the eligibility requirements. For example, exceptions, waivers or modifications of other development standards which would otherwise inhibit density and achievement of affordable housing goals for the development site, including, but not limited to, placement of public works improvements. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.060 Assurance of affordability.
Affordable housing units developed under this chapter shall remain available to persons and families of very low, low and moderate income, at an affordable housing cost or affordable rental cost, as those income and affordability levels as defined in Section 17.20.030, for a period of not less than fifty-five years, unless a longer period is required by a construction or mortgage financing program, mortgage insurance program, California Redevelopment Law, or housing grant, loan or subsidy program. The period of affordability required hereunder shall run concurrently with any period of affordability required by any other agency; provided, however, that the affordability period shall not be less than as set forth in this section. The project developer shall be required to enter into an appropriate agreement with the city to ensure affordability is maintained for the required period. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.070 Pre-application procedure.
Prior to submitting an application for an affordable housing development, the applicant or prospective developer should hold preliminary consultations with the community development department, redevelopment agency, and other city staff as may be desirable, to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys and other data. Such preliminary consultations should include information on potential federal, state, and local affordable housing funding availability, and program requirements in guaranteeing the project’s consistency with the objectives of this overlay district. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.080 Application – Development plans and map required.

6. A preliminary grading plan of the area;

E. Plans and elevations of building and structures sufficient to indicate the architectural style and construction standards;

F. The proposed means for assuring the continuing existence, maintenance and operation of the project as an affordable housing project;

G. Such other information as may be required by the director to allow for a complete analysis and appraisal of the planned development. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.20.090 Findings.
In approving a development project which utilizes the affordable housing overlay zone, the city council, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, shall make the following findings to ensure that the application is appropriate to the purpose and the location:

A. The concessions granted for density and deviation from design standards, are commensurate with the level of affordability. Specifically, the greater the extent of concessions and incentives, the greater the level of affordability.

B. The design of the proposed project, even with the concessions for density and deviation from design standards, is appropriate for the scale and style of the site (where additional units are being added to an existing development) and surrounding neighborhood. Specifically, the development will provide an attractive visual transition and will not significantly impact the integrity of the surrounding neighborhoods.

C. The developer has agreed to enter into an agreement to maintain the affordability of the project specific to the requirements of the city and any funding sources with greater or longer affordability requirements.

D. If located within the coastal zone, the project is found to be in conformity with the Local Coastal Program, including, but not limited to, sensitive habitat, public viewshed, public recreational access and open space protections. (Ord. 950 § 1, 2010)

17.21.070 Development standards.
Development standards shall be set forth in the Central Village Design Guidelines adopted by the city council on January 22, 1987, for the district. Structures destroyed by fire or natural disaster; provided, that the replacement structure is of the same size and in the same location, shall be given special consideration and may be exempted from Design Guideline requirements. To carry out the purposes of the zoning district first floor commercial uses shall not be converted to residential uses. (Ord. 691 § 2, 1990; Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.080 Height regulations.
No structure shall exceed twenty-seven feet in height in the C-V zone, except when a restoration of a historic building of Capitola exceeding the height limitation is proposed and has been recommended for approval by the planning commission. In any case, such structures shall provide for adequate light and air, and shall provide for considerations of view from adjacent properties. (Ord. 740 § 7, 1992; Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.090 Lot area.
There shall be no specific minimum lot area required in the C-V zone, except that there shall be sufficient area to satisfy any off-street parking and loading area requirements as established in the city’s parking ordinance. (Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.100 Lot coverage.
There shall be no specific maximum lot coverage in the C-V zone, except as follows:

A. Sufficient space shall be provided to satisfy offstreet parking and loading area requirements, notwithstanding that all parking may be provided within a structure or structures.

B. In the Riverview Avenue residential overlay district:

1. The small lots on the north side of Riverview Avenue shall allow ninety percent development of the lot without any specific setback requirements. The ten percent open space shall be located in the front part of the lot.

2. Lots on the south side of Riverview Avenue which are smaller than one thousand two hundred square feet shall be allowed eighty percent lot coverage. Lots which are greater than one thousand two hundred square feet shall be allowed seventy percent lot coverage. When calculating square footage for development, lot size shall not include parcels on the river side of the pathway.

“Lot coverage” shall be defined as the footprint of the building and area used to meet the parking requirements of the use. Garages, carports, the portion of any basement that exceeds two hundred fifty gross square feet excluding the access stairway, or open parking spaces used to meet the parking requirements are included as the actual square footage. Driveway approaches and sidewalks are not included in the lot coverage. For example: A thirty-foot by one-hundred-foot lot is three thousand square feet. A seventy percent lot coverage means a two thousand one hundred square foot footprint would be allowed. This typically would provide three-foot side yard setbacks (six hundred square feet) and a ten-foot front yard setback (three hundred square feet). However, flexibility is allowed in locating the structure.

C. In the Cherry Avenue residential overlay area:

1. Lots of less than one thousand square feet shall be allowed ninety percent lot coverage. Lots between one thousand one and two thousand square feet shall be allowed eighty percent lot coverage. Lots over two thousand square feet shall be allowed seventy-five percent lot coverage. For example, a thirty-foot by seventy-foot lot is two thousand one hundred square feet, which allows seventy-five percent lot coverage. A building footprint of one thousand five hundred seventy-five square feet may be developed, which provides three-foot side yard setbacks (four hundred twenty square feet), and a front yard setback of 5.1 feet (one hundred fifty-five square feet)

The definition of “lot coverage” is the footprint of the building and area used to meet the parking requirements of the use. Garages, carports or open space parking used to meet the parking requirements are included as the actual square footage. Driveway approaches and sidewalks are not included in lot coverage. (Ord. 774 § 3, 1995; Ord. 677 § 6(C), 1989; Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.110 Yards.
There shall be no yard requirements in the C-V zone, except that: (1) ten percent of lot area shall be developed as landscaped open area, at least partially fronting on, and open to, the street. No portion of this landscaped area shall be used for off-street parking, and (2) a minimum front open space for the northerly side of the first two hundred fifty feet of Cliff Drive, west of the intersection of Wharf Road, shall be ten feet. (Ord. 757 § 2, 1993; Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.120 Parking.
Parking requirements for buildings in the C-V zone shall be as provided in Chapter 17.51, and Section 17.21.140 and as required by this chapter:

A. Parking shall be provided for any change in use from residential to commercial, for the full amount required by the commercial operation. No space credit for the previous use will be granted.

B. When a substantial remodel or reconstruction of a building is done for reasons other than fire or natural disaster, parking requirements for the entire structure shall be provided.

C. Required parking for new users shall be provided at sites outside the village area, but within walking distance or at remote sites served by a shuttle system; exceptions to permit on site parking may be made for:

1. Nonhistoric structures in residential areas bounding the central commercial district of the village; and

2. For the Capitola Theater site and mercantile site as shown on the village residential overlay zone addendum map and providing that site designs shall provide for minimizing driveway cuts and for ground floor street frontage commercial development with parking areas/structures on the interior of the sites; and

3. If mandated under Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations and as consistent with the certified LCP. (Ord. 941 § 1, 2009; Ord. 677 § 6(D), 1989; Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.130 Loading areas.
Loading areas in the C-V zone shall be as provided in Chapter 17.51. (Ord. 622 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.21.140 Valet Parking.
The city may designate two village metered parking spaces, or similar space to allow for the operation of a valet parking program. (Ord. 941 § 2, 2009)

17.46.010 Purpose.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to establish review and permit procedures for the implementation of Capitola’s local coastal program, and to ensure that all private and public development projects within the city’s coastal zone are consistent with the city’s adopted and certified local coastal land use plan and implementation program and:

1. To achieve the basic state goals of maximizing public access to the coast and public recreational opportunities, as set forth in the California Coastal Act codified at Sections 30000 through 30900 of the California Public Resources Code. Section 30001.5(c) states that public access both to and along the shoreline shall be maximized consistent with sound resource conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners;

2. To implement the public access and recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act (Sections 30210 – 30255).

B. In achieving these purposes, this section shall be given the most liberal construction possible so that public access to the navigable waters shall always be provided and protected consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the California Coastal Act and Article X, Section 4, of the California Constitution. (Ord. 691 § 5, 1990; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.020 General provision.
This chapter establishes the coastal zone district (CZ) as a combining district, to be used in addition to and in conjunction with, existing zoning districts established to regulate land use within Capitola’s coastal zone. Principal permitted uses and conditional uses allowed in the CZ district are those uses allowed in the basic underlying zoning district. The regulations of this chapter shall apply in addition to those of the underlying district. In case of a conflict between regulations, the regulations of this chapter shall take precedence over those of the underlying district. (Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.030 Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply.

A. Access, Types: Types of access are as follows:

1. Lateral public access provides public access and use along or parallel to the sea.

2. Bluff top access provides public access and coastal viewing along a coastal bluff top area.

3. Vertical access provides a public access connection between the first public road, trail, or public use area nearest the sea and the publicly owned tidelands or established lateral access.

B. Access, Character.

1. Pass and repass refers to the right of the public to walk and run along an accessway. Because this use limitation can substantially restrict the public’s ability to enjoy adjacent publicly owned tidelands by restricting the potential use of lateral accesways, it will be applied only in connection with vertical access or other types of access where the findings required by Section 17.46.090 establish that the limitation is necessary to protect natural habitat values, topographic features (such as eroding bluffs), or privacy of the landowner.

An addition to development completed under the authority of a commission-issued permit shall be reviewed by the city pursuant to an application for a new permit, provided that the commission determines that the addition is not contrary to any term or condition of the Commission-issued permit.

C. The following principles are applicable to proposals pending at time of LCP certification:

1. Any development proposal which the city approved before certification of the local coastal program, but which has not been submitted to the commission for approval, shall be resubmitted to the city through an application for a permit pursuant to this chapter. Decision on the application shall be based solely on the requirements of city’s LCP.

2. Any development proposal which the city has approved before certification of the local coastal program, and for which an application has been filed with the commission, will return to the city for completion of review if the commission has not heard the application. Decision on the application will be based solely on the city’s local coastal plan. (Ord. 691 § 7, 1990; Ord. 677 § 1(B), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

The installation, testing and placement in service or the replacement of any necessary utility connection between an existing service facility and any development approved pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, that the city may, where necessary, require reasonable conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts on coastal resources, including scenic resources;

c. Maintenance dredging of existing navigation channels or moving dredged material from those channels to a disposal area outside the coastal zone, pursuant to a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers;

d. Repair or maintenance activities that do not result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of, the object of those repair or maintenance activities, not including extraordinary methods of repair and maintenance per subsection (A)(3) of this section. (Ord. 868 § 2, 2004; Ord. 727 §§ 2 – 5, 1992; Ord. 691 § 8, 1990; Ord. 677 § 1(C), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.055 Coastal exclusion zones.
Projects that will not result in a potential for any significant adverse effect, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources or on public access to, or along, the coast are excluded from the requirements of coastal development permit processing as authorized by and in accordance with the procedures certified by the California Coastal Commission.

Projects listed in this section have been approved as categorical exclusions by the California Coastal Commission for the exclusion zones as designated geographically by the coastal commission. Excluded projects as delineated below do not need to obtain a coastal permit, provided that a notice of exclusion is issued pursuant to this section. Requirements for any other city permit are unaffected by this section. Challenges to determination of exclusion may be made pursuant to subsection F of this section.

The Coastal Commission original jurisdiction and areas of deferred certification are not subject to local government coastal permit jurisdiction and, hence, are not excludable. In addition to this limitation and pursuant to Coastal Act Section 30610.5(b), tide and submerged land, beaches, and lots immediately adjacent to the inland extent of any beach, or of the mean high tide line of the sea where there is no beach, and all lands and waters subject to the public trust, shall not be excluded from coastal permit requirements.

This section does not exclude development in environmental sensitive habitat areas, except for Exclusion Zone B, the coastal appeal zone.

A. Coastal Exclusion Zone A is the Capitola nonappealable coastal area, as identified in the Capitola “Permit and Appeal Jurisdiction” Map, and illustrated in Exhibit A, incorporate herein by reference. Within Coastal Exclusion Zone A, the following categories of development are excluded from a coastal development permit:

1. Residential Development Exclusions.

a. The construction of new, including construction of second family dwellings (SDU), reconstruction, demolition, repair, relocation, alteration or addition of the size of any residential project (one to four units) on existing lots at densities specified in the land use plan, on lots of record or lot combinations legal as of the date of local coastal program certification.*

*    The city of Capitola adopted a second family unit ordinance No. 858, and an urgency ordinance No. 860 in compliance with state law AB 1866. Section 17.15.040 Principal Permitted Uses, was amended by Ordinance No. 858 to include secondary dwelling units (SDU) as a principally permitted use in the R-1 district, provided standards in Ordinance No. 860 are met. The city council finds that SDU exclusion will facilitate the provision of affordable housing-infill development that is consistent with the scale, size and character of the surrounding community, with no adverse impacts to coastal access or coastal resources.

b. The installation of fixtures and other structures directly attached or not to the main residence, including but not limited to patio covers, swimming pools, garages, greenhouses, gazebos, fences, pre-fabricated storage sheds, and non-habitable accessory structures.

9. Temporary structures exclusions. All temporary (six months or less; non-renewable) structures and uses consistent with regulations and do not conflict with public access and access policies.

C. Determination of Excludability. This exclusion shall apply to the permit requirements of the Coastal Act of 1976, pursuant to Public Resources Code Sections 30610(e) and 30610.5(b), and shall not be construed to exempt any person from the permit requirements of any other federal, state or local government agency.

The determination of whether a development is categorically excluded or not, for purposes of notice, hearings and appeals shall be made by the community development director or zoning administrator at the time the application for development within the coastal zone is submitted. This determination shall be made with reference to the certified local coastal program, including any maps, categorical exclusions, land use designations and zoning ordinances which are adopted as part of the local coastal program. Only developments that fully comply with the policies and ordinances of the certified local coastal program may be excluded under this categorical exclusion.

D. Notice of Exclusion. Notices of exclusion shall be issued on forms prepared for that purpose by the community development department, and shall indicate the developer’s name, street address, if any, and assessor’s parcel number(s) of the project site, a brief description of the development, and the date(s) of application for any other permit(s). A copy of the notice of exclusion shall be provided to the Coastal Commission and to any person who has requested such notice within five working days of issuance. The notice of exclusion may be issued at the time of project application but shall not become effective until all other approvals and permits required for the project are obtained. A copy of all terms and conditions imposed by the city shall be provided to the Coastal Commission, per Section 13315 of the California Code of Regulations.

E. Effect of a Categorical Exclusion Order. Per the California Code of Regulations Section 13247, an order granting an exclusion for a category of development removes that category of development from the permit requirements of Chapter 7 of the California Coastal Act of 1976 to the extent and in the manner specifically provided in the exclusion order. No development inconsistent with such order may take place unless the order is amended or terminated or a final development permit is issued.

F. Challenges. Where an applicant, interested person, coastal commission, the community development director (CDD) or zoning administrator (ZA) has a question as to the appropriate designation for the development the following procedures shall established whether a development is categorically excluded:

1. The CDD or the ZA shall make a determination as to what type of development is being proposed (i.e., categorically excluded) and shall inform the applicant of the notice and hearing requirements for that particular development.

2. If the determination of the CDD or ZA is challenged or if he or she wishes to have the Coastal Commission determine the appropriate designation, he or she shall notify the Commission by telephone of the dispute/question and shall request an executive director’s opinion.

3. The executive director of the Coastal Commission shall, within two working days of the CDD or zoning administrator’s request (or upon completion of a site inspection where such inspection is warranted), transmit determination as to whether the development is categorically excluded.

4. Where, after investigation, the executive director’s determination is not in accordance with the CDD or zoning administrator’s determination, the Coastal Commission shall hold a hearing for purposes of determining the appropriate designation for the area. The Coastal Commission shall schedule the hearing on the determination for the next practicable Commission meeting in the appropriate geographic region of the state following the CDD or zoning administrator’s request.

5. Exclusion shall not be approved until the determination process provided in subsections (F)(1) through (4) have been completed.

G. Waive of Public Hearing for “Minor Development.” This subdivision does not provide for a full exclusion from the requirement for a coastal development permit, however, it provides for waive of a required public hearing, allowing administrative review of a project. To qualify for this waive of public hearing requirement, the project shall be considered “minor development,” according to PRC Section 30624.9.

“Minor development” means a development that requires no other discretionary approval by the jurisdiction other than a coastal development permit. A local government may waive the public hearing requirement provided the project has no potential for adverse effects, either individually or cumulatively on coastal resources or public access to the shoreline, and it is consistent with the certified LCP, subject to special noticing as follows:

1. Notice that a public hearing would be held upon request is to be sent to all persons who would otherwise be required and any other persons who have shown interest;

2. No request for a public hearing is received within fifteen working days from the date notice was mailed out; and

3. The notice shall disclose that the failure to request a public hearing triggers the loss of appeal power on the matter being considered for administrative approval. (Ord. 868 § 3, 2004)

17.46.060 Permit application requirements and fees.
Application for a coastal permit shall be made concurrently with application for any other permits or approvals required for the project that are administered by the planning department. The coastal permit application fee shall be accompanied by:

A. A filing fee set by resolution of city council;

B. Evidence that the applicant is the owner or purchaser under contract, of the property involved, or has written permission of the owner to make the application;

(Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.070 Application review.
The city planning department shall review the submitted coastal permit application and notify the applicant of any additional application requirements within thirty days of receipt of the application. For the purposes of notice, hearing and appeals procedures, the city shall, at the time of submittal of coastal permit application, make a determination of whether the development is categorically excluded, exempted, appealable, or nonappealable. Upon determination, the city shall inform the applicant of the notice and hearing requirements for that development. If the determination is challenged by the applicant or interested person, the matter shall be referred to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission for resolution. (Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.080 Hearing and noticing procedures.
A. Hearing Required. At least one public hearing shall be required prior to approval of a coastal permit, except for a secondary dwelling unit.

B. Hearing Date. A public hearing date on a coastal permit application shall be set within ten working days upon completion of environmental review. If action on other permits or approvals is required for the project, the city shall act concurrently on the coastal permit.

E. Conditions. Approval of a coastal permit shall be conditioned as necessary to ensure conformance with and implementation of Capitola’s certified local coastal program. The approving authority may require modification and resubmittal of project plans, drawings and specifications to insure conformance with said program.

F. Access Requirements. Offers to dedicate or grant public access easements shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the local coastal land use plan and Section 17.46.010. The offer of dedication or granting should ordinarily be made on forms provided by the city. Access easements shall be provided in accordance with the following provisions of the local coastal land use plan.

Provisions regarding implementation of access easement requirements are included within subsection G of this section.

1. Access easements shall be provided in accordance with provisions of the local coastal program land use plan and the following:

As a condition of approval and prior to issuance of a permit or other authorization for any new development identified in subsection (F)(1)(a) through (d) of this section, except as provided in subsection (F)(2), an offer of dedicate an easement (or other legal mechanism) for one or more of the types of access identified in Section 17.46.030 shall be required and shall be supported by findings required by Section 17.46.090(D); provided, that no such condition of approval shall be imposed if the analysis required by Section 17.46.090(D)(1)(a) and (b) establishes that the development will not adversely affect, either individually or cumulatively, the ability of the public to reach and use public tidelands and coastal resources.

a. New development on any parcel or location identified in the land use plan including but not limited to the Park Avenue/Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way along the bluff top between Capitola Village and New Brighton Beach;

b. New development between the nearest public roadway and the sea;

c. New development on any site where there is substantial evidence of a public right of access to the sea acquired through use or a public right of access through legislative authorization;

d. New development on any site where a trail, bluff top access or other recreational access is necessary to mitigate impacts of the development on public access.

2. Exceptions. Subsection (F)(1) of this section shall apply except in the following instances:

a. Projects excepted from the definition of “new development” in Section 17.46.030;

b. Where findings required by subsection (D)(1) and (2) of this section establish any of the following:

i. Public access is inconsistent with the public safety, military security needs, or protection of fragile coastal resources;

ii. Adequate access exists nearby; or

iii. Agriculture would be adversely affected;

c. Exceptions identified in subsection (F)(2)(b) shall be supported by written findings required by subsection (D)(3) of this section.

3. A condition to require vertical public access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of access, (1) located in specific locations identified in the certified local coastal program for future vertical access, or (2) located in a site for which the city has reviewed an application for a development permit and has determined a vertical accessway is required pursuant to the access and recreation policies of the Coastal Act or the applicable provisions of the local coastal program.

A condition to require vertical access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of vertical access and be limited to the public right of passive recreational use unless another character of use is specified as a condition of the development. In determining whether another character of use is appropriate, findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in subsection (D)(2) of this section.

Each vertical accessway shall be legally described as required in subsection (G) of this section. If a residential structure is proposed, the accessway should be sited closer than ten feet to the structure (or another distance if specified in the certified LUP).

4. A condition to require lateral access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of lateral public access and passive recreational use along the shoreline (or public recreational area, bikeway, or blufftop area, as applicable); provided that in some cases controls on the time, place and manner of uses may be justified by site characteristics including sensitive habitat values or fragile topographic features, or by the need to protect the privacy of residential development.

Active recreational use may be appropriate in many cases where the development is determined to be especially burdensome on public access. Examples include cases where the burdens of the proposed project would severely impact public recreational use of the shoreline, where the proposed development is not one of the priority uses specified in Public Resources Code Section 30222, where active recreational uses reflect the historic public use of the site, where active recreational uses would be consistent with the use of the proposed project and where such uses would not significantly interfere with the privacy of the landowner. In determining the appropriate character of public use, findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in subsection (D)(2) of this section. Lateral access shall be legally described as required in subsection (G) of this section.

5. A condition to require public access along a bluff top as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of scenic and visual access from the bluff top to the public tidelands.

The bluff top access shall be limited to passive recreational use and coastal viewing purposes unless another character of use is specified as a condition of development. In determining the appropriate character of use findings shall be made on the specific factors identified in subsection (D)(2) of this section.

Each bluff top accessway shall be described in the conditions of approval of the coastal development permit as an area beginning at the current bluff edge extending twenty-five feet inland (or a different standard, greater or lesser as determined to be necessary for public safety or geologic stability, if specified in the certified LUP). However, the accessway shall not extend any closer than ten feet from an occupied residential structure. Due to the potential for erosion of the bluff edge, the condition shall include a mechanism that will cause the accessway to be adjusted inland as the edge recedes. Any permanent improvements should be set back from the accessway by a distance derived by multiplying the annual rate of blufftop retreat by the life expectancy in years of the improvements.

The accessway shall be legally described as required in subsection (G) of this section, with the furthest inland extent of the area possible referenced as a distance from a fixed monument in the following manner:

Such easement shall be ____ feet wide located along the bluff top as measured inland from the daily bluff edge. As the daily bluff top edge may vary and move inland, the location of this right of way will change over time with the then current bluff edge, but in no case shall it extend any closer than feet from (a fixed inland point, such as the centerline of a public road or other easement monument).

6. A condition to require public access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or other authorization to proceed with development) required pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of access and active recreational use, (1) along a designated alignment of a coastal recreational path or trail in specific locations identified in the LCP for implementation of trail access, or (2) in locations where it has been determined that a trail access is required to link recreational areas to the shoreline or provide alternative recreation and access opportunities pursuant to the access and recreation policies of the LCP and Coastal Act, consistent with other provisions of this chapter. In determining if another character of use is appropriate, findings shall be made on the specific factors enumerated in subsection (D)(2) of this section. The trail access shall be legally described as required by subsection (G) of this section.

7. A condition to require public recreational access as a condition of approval of a coastal development permit (or some other authorization to proceed with development) required pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall provide the public with the permanent right of access and use within a designated recreational access area. Conditions required pursuant to this section shall specify the location and extent of the public access area. The form and content should take the form of requirements in subsection (F)(3) through (6) of this section as applicable. The accessway shall be legally described as required in subsection (G) of this section.

G. Review of Legal Documents. Prior to issuance of a coastal permit, all legal documents pertaining to public access and open space or conservation easements which are conditions of approval of a coastal permit, shall be forwarded to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission for review and approval of the legal adequacy and consistency with the requirements of potential accepting agencies.

An access dedication required pursuant to subsection (F)(1) of this section shall be described in the condition of approval of the permit or other authorization for development in a manner that provides the public, the property owner, and the accepting agency with the maximum amount of certainty as to the location of the accessway. As part of the condition of approval, easements shall be described as follows: (1) for lateral access: along the entire width of the property from the mean high tide line to (as applicable) the toe of the bluff, the toe of the seawall, or other appropriate boundary such as stringline or dripline; (2) for blufftop access or trail access: extending inland from the bluff edge or along the alignment of a recreational trail; (3) for vertical access: extending from the road to the shoreline (or bluff edge). A privacy buffer provided pursuant to subsection (J) of this section shall be described, as applicable.

Prior to the issuance of the coastal development permit or other authorization for development, the landowner shall (except as precluded by Nolan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825) execute and record a document in a form and content acceptable to the coastal commission (or local agency authorized pursuant to Title 14 California Code of Regulations 113574(b)), irrevocably offering to dedicate to a public agency or private association approved by the coastal commission (or local agency authorized pursuant to Title 14 California Code of Regulations 113574(b)) an easement for a specific type of access as described in Section 17.46.030 and a specific character of use as described in Section 17.46.030, as applicable to the particular condition.

The recorded document shall provide that the offer to dedicate shall not be used or construed to allow anyone, prior to acceptance of the dedication, to interfere with the rights of public access acquired through use which may exist on the property.

The recorded document shall include legal descriptions of both the applicant’s entire parcel and the easement area and a map to scale. The offer shall be recorded free of prior liens and any other encumbrances which the coastal commission (or local agency authorized by the commission) determines may affect the interest being conveyed. The offer to dedicated shall run with the land in favor of the people of the state, binding all successors and assignees, and shall be irrevocable for a period of twenty-one years, such period running from the date of recording.

The commission shall have fifteen working days from the receipt of the documents where review is requested and thirty working days where preparation is requested, to complete the review or preparation and notify the applicant and local government of recommended revisions, if any.

If the local government does not receive notification of the inadequacy of documents it has prepared within the fifteen working-day period, the documents are deemed approved and the permit may be issued upon proof that the documents have been recorded free of prior liens and encumbrances which the executive director determines may affect the interest being conveyed, in accordance with the provisions of the local government’s local coastal program.

Where the commission prepares the legal documents, the local government may issue the permit after the thirty-day preparation period has expired, or the applicant has signed a document that meets the standards of this section, and the document has been recorded free of prior liens and encumbrances which the executive director determines may affect the interest being conveyed, in accordance with the provisions of the local governments’ local coastal program.

As a requirement for any public access condition, prior to the issuance of the permit or other authorization for development, the applicant shall be required to furnish a title report and all necessary subordination agreement. Title insurance may also be required where easements are being granted. The amount of all reflect the estimated cost to acquire an equivalent accessway or recreational use elsewhere in the vicinity. All offers shall be made free of all encumbrances which the approving authority pursuant to this subsection determines may affect the interest being conveyed. If any such interest exists which could erase the access easement, it must be subordinated through a written and recorded document.

H. Protection of Historic Public Use. Development shall be sited and designed in a manner which does not interfere with or diminish any public right of access which may have been established based on historic public use. Only when site constraints are so severe that siting of the accessway or recreational use area in its historic location would significantly impair the proposed development and alternative development siting is not feasible, development may be sited in the area of public right of access based on historic use provided that the applicant provides an equivalent area of public access or recreation to and along the same destination and including the same type and intensity of public use as previously existed on the site. Mechanisms for guaranteeing the continued public use of the area or equivalent area shall be required in accordance with subsections (F)(3) through (7) of this section.

An access condition shall not serve to extinguish or waive, public prescriptive rights. In permits where evidence shows the possibility of such prescriptive rights, the following language shall be added to the access condition:

Nothing in this condition shall be construed to constitute a waiver of any prescriptive rights which may exist on the parcel itself or on the designated condition.

I. Management Plan. A management plan may be required in conjunction with a dedication of public access in any case where there is substantial evidence of potential conflicts between public access use and other uses on or immediately adjacent to the site. Examples include access in areas of sensitive habitats, agricultural resources, or significant hazards, or adjoining residential neighborhoods or military security areas. The plan shall be prepared by the accepting agency and approved by the city prior to the opening of the access to public use. Where applicable, the plan should specify management controls on time and intensity of uses, standards for privacy buffers, and requirements for maintenance of aesthetic values through such measures as litter control.

J. Privacy Buffers. Separation between a public accessway and adjacent residential use may be provided when necessary to protect the landowner’s privacy or security as well as the public’s right to, use of the accessway. Any such buffer shall be provided within the development area. Access should not be sited closer to any residential structure than the distance specified in the certified LUP, or where there is not distance specified, no closer than ten fee. The buffer can be reduced where separation is achieved through landscaping fences or grades separation.

K. Implementation. A dedicated accessway shall not be required to be opened to public use until a public agency or private association approved in accordance with subsection (G) of this section agrees to accept responsibility for maintenance and liability of the access, except in cases where immediate public access is implemented through a deed restriction.

In any case where the size and character of a development would impose very substantial burdens on public access, such as a large resort development on the shoreline and where the applicant has the capacity to operate and maintain the accessway or recreation area, deed restriction may be required instead of an offer to dedicate in order to ensure immediate public use of the area and maintenance of the area by the applicant and successors in interest. In any such case, all other, applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply.

Access facilities constructed on access easements (e.g., walkways, paved paths, boardwalk, etc.) should be no wider than necessary to accommodate the numbers and types of users that can reasonably be expected and in accordance with standards in subsection (F) of this section.

As a requirement for any public access condition, prior to the issuance of the permit or other authorization for development, the applicant shall be required to furnish a title report and all necessary subordination agreements. Title insurance may also be required where easements are being granted. The amount of insurance shall reflect the estimated cost to acquire an equivalent accessway or recreational use elsewhere in the vicinity. All offers shall be made free of all encumbrances which the approving authority pursuant to subsection G of this section determines may affect the interest being conveyed. If any such interest exists which could erase the access easement, it must be subordinated through a written and recorded agreement.

Where revisions are required to meet the standards of this section, the permit shall not be issued until the local government has been notified that all issues of adequacy, uniformity and consistency have been resolved and the documents has been recorded free of prior liens and encumbrances, in accordance with the provisions of the certified local coastal program. (Ord. 941 § 1, 2009; Ord. 754, 1993; Ord. 727 §§ 6, 7, 1992; Ord. 691 §§ 9 – 13, 1990; Ord. 685 § 11, 1989; Ord. 677 § 1(D), (E), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.100 Notice of final action.
A. Within seven calendar days of a final local decision on a coastal permit application, the city shall provide notice of its action by first class mail to the applicant, the state Coastal Commission, and any other persons who have requested such notice by submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the city. The notice shall contain the city’s adopted findings, conditions of approval, indication of whether the project is appealable to the Coastal Commission, and procedures for appeal to the Commission. A local decision on a coastal permit application shall be deemed final when all local rights of appeal have been exhausted as defined below.

B. Failure to Act – Notice.

1. Notification by Applicant. If the city has failed to act on an application within the time limits set forth in Government Code Sections 65950 to 65957.1, thereby approving the development by operation of law, the person claiming a right to proceed pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950 to 65957.1 shall notify, in writing, the community development director and the commission of his or her claim that the development has been approved by operation of law. Such notice shall specify the application which is claimed to be approved and shall be delivered to city within sixty days of the day the application was allegedly approved by law.

2. Notification by Local Government. When the city determines that the time limits established pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950 to 65957.1 have expired, the community development director shall, within seven calendar days of such determination, notify any person entitled to receive notice pursuant to Section 13571(a) of Title 14 of the California Administrative Code that the application has been approved by operation of law pursuant to Government Code Sections 65950 to 65957.1 and the application may be appealed to the commission pursuant to Section 13110 et seq., of Title 14 of the California Administrative Code. (This section shall apply equally to a city determination that the project has been approved by operation of law and to a judicial determination that the project has been approved by operation of law.) (Ord. 677 § 1(F), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.110 Appeals.

An appeal shall be filed with the planning department in the form of a letter requesting the appeal. A public hearing on an appeal shall be held within forty-five days after the department of planning receives a completed appeal form. A notice of the public hearing on the appeal shall be mailed by the planning department to the applicant and any known aggrieved person not less than ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall contain the same information as the original notice except that it shall also give the appellant’s name and state that the hearing is an appeal. All decisions on appeal shall be based upon the same findings of fact required in the original proceeding. Except for appeals to the Coastal Commission for projects located seaward of the appealable area boundary, there shall be no further local appeals after a decision on appeal.

B. Appeals to the California Coastal Commission.

1. Local actions on coastal permits may be appealed by an aggrieved person to the California Coastal Commission. All developments approved or approved with conditions may be appealed if they are located within the appealable area as designated by map or ordinance. Decision on major energy facilities or major public works may be appealed if approved, approved with conditions or denied. Appeals shall be according to the procedures of this section, provided that:

a. All local appeals of city actions provided for by this section have been exhausted and no fee was charged for such appeal; and

b. The appeal is filed (to) with the coastal commission within the commission’s ten working day appeal period which begins upon receipt of a valid notice of final action from the city.

c. Any coastal commission appeal by two or more coastal commissioners, when the local appeals of city actions provided for by this section have not been exhausted, shall constitute a local appeal which has not been exhausted. Any local action to modify or reverse the appealed action shall require that a new coastal commission appeal by two or more coastal commissioners be filed in order to constitute a complete coastal commission appeal.

2. An appeal to the state Coastal Commission may be made for the following types of development:

a. Developments approved located between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within three hundred feet of the inland extent of any beach or three hundred feet of the mean high tide line of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance;

b. Approved developments, not included in subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section located on tidelands, submerged lands, public trust lands, within one hundred feet of any wetland, estuary, stream or within three hundred feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff;

c. Any development which constitutes a major public works project or a major energy facility.

3. All appealable developments may be appealed by an applicant, any two members of the state Coastal Commission, or any aggrieved person. Grounds for appeal of an approved coastal permit for developments described in subsection (B)(2) of this section, are limited to the following:

a. The development fails to provide adequate physical access, public or private commercial use, or interferes with such uses;

b. The development fails to protect public views from any public road or from a recreational area to and along the coast;

c. The development is not compatible with the established physical scale of the area;

d. The development may significantly alter existing natural landforms;

e. The development does not comply with shoreline erosion and geologic setback requirements.

C. The grounds for appeal for development described in subsections (B)(2)(b) and (c) of this section are limited to consideration of whether or not the proposed development is in conformance with the certified local coastal program. (Ord. 685 § 7, 1989; Ord. 677 § 1(G), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A(part), 1987)

17.46.120 Permit issuance.
A. Effective Date of a Coastal Permit. A coastal development permit shall be effective as follows:

1. Outside the Coastal Commission Appeal Area. The coastal permit shall become effective ten working days after the city’s final decision;

2. Within the Coastal Commission Appeal Area. Decisions on applications for appealable developments shall become effective after a ten-working-day appeal period to the coastal commission has expired and no appeal has been filed. The ten-day appeal period shall start the day after receipt by the coastal commission of adequate notice of the final local action.

B. Expiration of Permits.

1. Except as otherwise provided for in conditions of approval, every right or privilege authorized under this chapter shall terminate two years after granting the request, if such right or privilege has not been exercised in good faith within that time. Such termination will take effect without further city action if a timely request for extension of time has not been made or is denied. Any interruption or cessation beyond the control of the property owner shall not result in the termination of such right or privilege.

2. Upon written request received prior to the expiration of the permit, a one-year extension of such right or privilege may be granted by the city council or planning commission, whichever granted the permit. Such request may be granted upon a finding that no substantial change of circumstances has occurred and that such extension would not be detrimental to the purpose of the certified local coastal program and zoning ordinance.

C. Revocation of Permits. Except as otherwise provided, upon determination that there has been a violation of the conditions of any permit or approval provided by this chapter, the community development director shall schedule a public hearing before the city council or planning commission, whichever granted the permit, to determine if such permit or approval should be revoked. At such hearing, the community development director shall present evidence of such violation. If the hearing body finds that the conditions have been violated and that the property owner has not made a good-faith effort to comply, the permit or approval shall be revoked. The property owner shall have the same right of appeal as would have been applicable if the initial application had been denied by the person or body granting the permit.

D. Limiting Resubmission. Whenever a request under the provisions of this section has been denied and such denial has become final, no new application for the same or similar request may be accepted within one year of the denial date, unless the community development director finds that a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred to warrant a new application. (Ord. 873 § 22, 2004; Ord. 627 Exh. A (part), 1987)

17.46.130 Emergency permits.
A. Emergency coastal permits may be granted at the discretion of the community development director or a local official designated by the city council for projects normally requiring coastal permit approval, which must be undertaken as emergency measures to prevent loss or damage to life, health or property, or to restore, repair or maintain public works, utilities and services during and immediately following a natural disaster or serious accident.

B. Application in cases of emergencies shall be made to the city by letter if time allows, and by telephone or in person if time does not allow. The applicant shall submit the appropriate fees at the time of application for an emergency permit.

C. The information to be reported during the emergency, if it is possible to do so, or to be fully reported after the emergency, shall include the following:

1. The nature of the emergency;

2. The cause of the emergency, insofar as this can be established;

3. The location of the emergency;

4. The remedial, protective or preventive work required to deal with the emergency; and

5. The circumstances during the emergency that appeared to justify the course(s) of action taken, including the probable consequences of failing to take action.

D. The community development director or other designated local official shall verify the facts, including the existence and nature of the emergency, insofar as time allows. Upon the issuance of an emergency permit, the applicant shall submit a completed coastal permit application and any required technical reports within a time specified by the community development director, not to exceed thirty days.

E. The emergency work authorized under approval of an emergency permit shall be limited to activities necessary to protect the endangered structure or essential public structure. The emergency approval shall be voided if the approved activity is not exercised within fifteen days of issuance of the emergency permit. The approval shall expire sixty days after issuance. Any work completed outside of these time periods requires a regular coastal permit approval unless an extension is granted by the city.

F. Criteria for Granting Permit. The community development director shall provide public notice of the proposed emergency action, with the extent and type of notice determined on the basis of the nature of the emergency itself. The community development director may grant an emergency permit upon reasonable terms and conditions, including an expiration date and the necessity for a regular permit application later, if the director finds that:

1. An emergency exists and requires action more quickly than permitted by the procedures for ordinary permits and the development can and will be completed within thirty days unless otherwise specified by the terms of the permit;

2. Public comment on the proposed emergency action has been reviewed if time allows; and

3. The work proposed would be consistent with the requirements of the certified LCP.

G. Reporting of Emergency Permits. The community development director shall report emergency permits to the city council planning commission at their next regular meeting and to the Coastal Commission. The decision to issue an emergency permit is solely at the discretion of the community development director, although subsequent coastal permits required for the project are subject to all applicable hearing requirements in accordance with the Coastal Act.

H. Emergency Waivers Granted by the Coastal Commission. The Coastal Commission retains authority for granting emergency waivers for those events which threaten life of public property (Coastal Act Section 30611) and for all development located within the Commission’s original jurisdiction. (Ord. 691 § 13, 1990; Ord. 685 §§ 6, 15, 1989; Ord. 677 § 1(H), (I), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.140 Amendments.
An applicant may petition to amend a coastal permit by filing a new application pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. Any amendment approved for development in the coastal zone shall be found consistent with all applicable local coastal program requirements, and this chapter with regards to requirements of jurisdiction, hearings, notices and findings for approval. (Ord. 677 § 1 (J), 1989; Ord. 627 Exhibit A (part), 1987)

17.46.150 Consistency required.
The approving body (or the Coastal Commission on appeal) may approve a density greater than allowed by the underlying land use and zone district designations for affordable residential projects if the following criteria are met:

A. The proposed increased density is consistent with the Coastal Act Section 30604(f), Government Code Section 65915, and Chapter 18.03 of the Capitola Municipal Code.

B. If located within the coastal zone, the project is found to be in conformity with the Local Coastal Program (including, but not limited to, sensitive habitat, public viewshed, public recreational access and open space protections), with the exception of the density provisions. (Ord. 950 § 2, 2010)

(Ord. 628 § 2, 1987)

17.48.090 Beach area regulations.
In the GH district:

A. A geologic/engineering report shall be required for all developments located on a beach, including shoreline protective measures. “Shoreline protective measures” includes the installation, in an area where coastal process operate, of any structure or material, including but not limited to riprap or a seawall, for the purpose of protecting a structure, road, utility or transmission line. Shoreline protection structures shall be permitted only when they are:

1. Necessary to protect existing development other than accessory structures; or

2. Necessary to protect public beaches in danger from erosion, and only if nonstructural solutions (i.e., artificial beach nourishment, relocation of structures, have proven to be infeasible; and

Bluff and cliff top development shall be permitted only if the design and setback provisions are designed to assure stability and structural integrity for the expected life of the development (at least fifty years) and if the development (including storm runoff, foot traffic, grading and irrigation) will neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion problems or geological instability of the site or surrounding areas.

B. A geologic/engineering report shall be required for any blufftop or cliff development which is proposed within two hundred feet of the cliff edge. In specific areas of known geological stability or where adequate protective devices already exist, a lesser area of demonstration may be designated. The city may designate a greater area of demonstration or exclude development entirely in areas of known high instability. (Ord. 677 § 15(A), 1989; Ord. 628 § 2, 1987)

17.48.110 Earthquake fault areas.
In any area determined by the State Geologist, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 2622, to be a special studies zone, a geologic/ engineering report shall be required before any developmental permit may be issued. Nothing in this section shall diminish the duties of any person arising out of the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act (Public Resources Code Section 2621 and following). (Ord. 628 § 2, 1987)

17.48.120 Floodplain.

*    Prior ordinance history: Ords. 575, 609, 619, 647, 656 and 755.

17.50.010 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Capitola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.020 Findings of fact.
The flood hazard areas of the city of Capitola are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.050 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.060 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.070 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Capitola, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.080 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.090 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated June 3, 1986 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) dated June 3, 1986, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMS and FBFMs are on file at 420 Capitola Avenue, city of Capitola. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

2. The condition resulting from flood related erosion.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

“Flood Hazard Boundary Map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source, see “Flood.”

“Floodplain administrator” is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain area” means the land on either side of a creek or other watercourse which may be subject to flooding. “Floodplain area” includes the one-hundred-year floodplain as determined by the Federal Flood Insurance Program and shown on both the Flood Insurance Rate Map and Flood Boundary and Floodway map, each dated June 3, 1986.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, when possible natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

“Flood-related erosion area” means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water which, due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

“Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood related erosion damage including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway encroachment lines” means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps.

“Floodway fringe” is the area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization” means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city of Capitola will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

The city of Capitola requires that the variance must be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbor likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

The building official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.120 Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

A. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

1. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

2. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Capitola; and

5. All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “Market Value.”

2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

C. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 17.50.090, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 17.50.210 through 17.50.270.

Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.

D. Notification of Other Agencies.

1. Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

c. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

2. Base Flood Elevation Changes due to Physical Alterations.

a. Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

b. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

3. Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

E. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

F. The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

1. Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection A; and

2. The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.280 Variance procedure.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city of Capitola to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.290 Conditions for variances.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 17.50.110 through 17.50.200 and 17.50.210 through 17.50.270 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Section 17.50.100) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city of Capitola need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city of Capitola believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Santa Cruz County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.300 Approval of variances.
A. In passing upon requests for variances, the city of Capitola shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

1. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B. Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and

3. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

C. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A, B and D are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of Section 17.50.290(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city of Capitola may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.310 Nonconforming structures in floodplain.
A structure which was lawful before enactment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued as a nonconforming structure subject to the following condition: if any nonconforming structure is destroyed by flood, earthquake, tsunami or, for another cause to the extent of fifty percent or more of its fair market value immediately prior to the destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.320 Variance appeal procedure.
A. Appeal procedure for all decisions made under this chapter shall be in conformance with standard appeal procedures of Chapter 2.52 of this code.

B. The director of public works shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.

C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted should be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built in variance with these rules and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from such variance. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

17.50.330 Disclosure requirement.
A person, who is acting as an agent for a seller of real property which is located within a FP district or the seller if he or she is acting without an agent, shall disclose to any prospective purchaser the fact that the property is located within a FP district. The community development director may adopt methods of informing owners and real estate sales persons of this requirement. (Ord. 970 § 1, 2012)

A change in use for this chapter is a change to a use which has a higher parking requirement.

D. Residential Structures. In the case of residential structures in any district, no additional parking shall be required for reconstruction or structural alteration of existing residential structures, so long as the habitable floor space of the structure is not increased by more than ten percent. If the structure is enlarged by more than ten percent, the minimum parking requirements according to Sections 17.15.130 and 17.51.130 shall be required.

17.51.040 Obligation continuing.
The schedule of requirements for off-street parking space and off-street loading space applicable to newly erected or substantially altered structures shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of the real estate on which any such structure is located so long as the structure is in existence and its use requiring vehicle parking or vehicle loading facilities continues, and it shall be unlawful for an owner of any building affected by this chapter to discontinue, change, or dispense with, or cause the discontinuance or change of the required vehicle parking or loading space apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of such structure, without establishing alternate parking or loading space which meets with the requirements of and is in compliance with this chapter, or for any person to use such building without acquiring such land for vehicle parking or loading space which meets the requirements of and is in compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 388 § 17.04, 1975)

17.51.050 Development and maintenance of parking areas.
Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private parking area, including a commercial parking lot and also an automobile or trailer sales lot, shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the requirements set out in Sections 17.51.055 through 17.51.090. (Ord. 623, 1987; Ord. 388 § 17.05 1975)

17.51.055 Parking lot design.
Parking lot design shall be reviewed through the architectural and site review process to assure that the design is coordinated with the site and the uses in the project, that adequate ingress and egress is provided, and that the design meets the minimum standards of the city. When it is determined that minimum standards are not sufficient for the project, the planning commission may require more than minimum allowable standards. (Ord. 623, 1987)

17.51.060 Screening and landscaping.
A. Commercial parking lots shall be screened from public streets and residential neighborhoods with a landscaping strip. Commercial parking shall not be closer than ten feet to an R zone, unless a six-foot masonry wall is constructed. All commercial parking lots of more than ten cars shall be screened from any R zone with a minimum six-foot-high masonry wall.

B. In off-street parking areas for more than four vehicles, one twenty-four-inch box tree shall be planted for each two parking spaces. (See 41st Avenue Design Guidelines Landscape Requirements.)

C. Additional landscaping of two feet, consisting of low shrubs or ground cover, may be planted between a parking stall and the required landscape area, but such landscaping shall not count toward the percentage mandated by the 41st Avenue Design Guidelines. This method will allow vehicles to extend over the additional landscape areas, as well as reduce the required length of the parking space from eighteen feet to sixteen feet. (Ord. 623, 1987; Ord. 388 § 17.05(a), 1975)

17.51.063 Irrigation.
All landscape areas must have automatic irrigation systems designed to provide complete coverage to promote and sustain healthy plant life, unless an exception is approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 873 § 13, 2004; Ord. 623, 1987)

17.51.066 Landscape protection.
Landscaping should usually be protected from vehicles and pedestrian damage by a six-inch high, four-inch wide cement curb. (Ord. 623, 1987)

17.51.090 Lighting.
All parking space area lighting shall be energy efficient and designed so that any glare is directed away from residential properties. No light source shall be visible to residential areas or create any hazardous traffic condition. Security lighting shall be provided in areas used by the public during nighttime hours. (Ord. 623, 1987; Ord. 388 § 17.05(c), 1975)

17.51.100 Floor area defined.
For purposes of calculating the nonresidential parking requirements of this chapter, “floor area” means the entire floor area in all enclosed structures, without deduction for such features as interior walls, stairways or storage. It also includes the floor area of patios, courtyards and outside dining areas primarily utilized by a business or group of related businesses, its customers, or its employees, as opposed to the general public. In shopping centers it does not include quasi-public seating areas as defined in Section 17.51.105. (Ord. 873 § 14, 2004; Ord. 756 § 1, 1993; Ord. 623, 1987; Ord. 388 § 17.06, 1975)

17.51.105 Quasi-public seating areas.
For purposes of this chapter, “quasi-public seating area” means an area located in a privately owned shopping center which is open to all of the patrons of all of the businesses of the shopping center and which consists of a seating area or similar area where there are tables, chairs, benches or landscaping or other similar amenities. The fact that such areas are exempt from the parking requirements of this chapter shall not in any sense be construed to exempt such areas from architectural and site review or use permit requirements. This section shall not be construed as in any way authorizing the conversion of areas devoted to landscaping (in any landscape plan utilized to obtain approval of a city permit) to a quasi-public seating area. (Ord. 756 § 2, 1993)

17.51.110 Fractional measurements.
In determining the number of required parking, fractions of spaces over one-half shall be rounded up to the next whole number. (Ord. 623, 1987; Ord. 388 § 17.07, 1975)

17.51.120 Location of required parking and loading facilities.
The off-street parking facilities required for the uses mentioned in this chapter, and for other similar uses, shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve. When practical difficulties as determined by the planning commission, prevent their establishment upon the same or immediate adjacent lot, they may be located within reasonable distance of the premises to which the parking requirement pertains, and may be located in a residential zone if the land lies adjacent to any building being erected in a commercial or industrial zone. The off-street loading facilities required for the uses mentioned in this chapter, and for similar uses, shall in all cases be on the same or immediately adjacent lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve. In no case shall the required off-street loading space be part of the area used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this chapter. Space for required off-street parking and loading shall not occupy any part of a required open space for a rear or side yard. On corner or through lots, parking space may not be included as part of required yards lying adjacent to either street. (Ord. 388 § 17.08, 1975)

Subsequent to the approval of a given business center’s master sign program, individual sign permits may be issued by the community development director or his or her designee without further planning commission review. Approval of the master sign program does not waive the building department permit requirements for individual signs. (Ord. 785 § 2, 1995)

17.57.090 Special signage for commercial sites located in geographically constrained areas.
A. A parcel or contiguous group of parcels forming a commercial site, which is located in the CC community commercial zoning district and meets the following criteria, may apply for special signage through the planning commission: the commercial site is geographically located such that, except to a very limited degree, the signs are not visible from other properties, nor from any public street (except one that dead ends within the commercial site).

B. The application for special signage, and the planning commission decision in response to it, shall, for each variety of permanent and temporary signage, specify the number, size, type, design, color and location of the sign, along with the manner, frequency and duration of the sign display.

C. The planning commission may approve additional or variations to any type of signage upon making the following findings:

1. The special signage, as designed and conditioned, is necessary and appropriate for the subject commercial site, in order to allow the site and the businesses located within it to be competitive with other businesses of a similar nature located elsewhere, and/or to be competitive with industry standards governing sale of the merchandise offered at the site.

2. The special signage, as designed and conditioned, will not have a significant adverse effect on the character and integrity of the surrounding area. This subsection C does not allow approval of: signs over sixteen feet high, sound signs, abandoned signs, balloon signs greater than fifteen inches in diameter, or freestanding signs.

D. The planning commission or city council may amend any approval of temporary signs under this section provided:

1. The permittees are given at least ten calendar days’ written notice prior to the hearing;

17.57.100 Maintenance and repair.
All signs, together with all supports, braces, guys and anchors shall be free from excessive deterioration, rot, rust and loosening and shall be maintained in safe condition as determined by the building official or community development director.

17.57.110 Lighting and illumination.
All illuminated signs shall be designed in such a way as to avoid undue glare or reflection of light on private property and surrounding areas. In the R-1 and R-M zoning districts, signs shall be constructed in such a way that any lighting or lighting effect shall have an intensity of no more than thirty-five footcandles as measured from ground level. In all other districts, no sign shall have an intensity of more than fifty footcandles as measured from ground level (Ord. 785 § 2, 1995)

17.57.120 Nonconforming signs.
A. Signs which are lawfully in existence and in use prior to and at the time of the legal adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, may remain in use even though they do not conform with the provisions of this chapter.

B. Repainting, refacing or relettering of existing legal nonconforming signs is permitted when the new copy is to be the same size and design as that existing or originally approved. (Ord. 785 § 2, 1995)

17.57.130 Unsafe and unlawful signs.
A. Whenever a sign is found to be erected or maintained in violation of any provisions of this chapter or of any other ordinance or law, the planning department shall order that such sign be altered, repaired, reconstructed, demolished or removed as may be appropriate to abate such condition. Any work required to be done, shall, unless a different time is specified, be completed within ten days of the date of such order.

B. Failure, neglect or refusal to comply with such order of the planning department shall be sufficient basis for the revocation of any permit granted under this chapter, and shall constitute a separate offense.

C. In addition to any other remedies provided by law, the planning department shall have the power and authority summarily to remove, or cause to be removed, at the owner’s expense, any sign erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 785 § 2, 1995)

17.57.140 Enforcement.
The provisions of Chapter 17.84 shall be used to enforce the contents of this chapter, but are not exclusive. (Ord. 785 § 2, 1995)

17.60.160    Master conditional use permits – Tenant use permits.

17.60.010 Purpose.
The purpose of a conditional use permit or master use permit is to allow review of uses which may only be suitable in specific locations in the zoning district or which may need special site planning or operating conditions to assure the use does not adversely impact other uses in the zone. (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.01, 1975)

17.60.020 Required.
A conditional use permit is required prior to:

A. The issuance of a building permit for the construction of any structure that requires a building permit, unless the design-use is a “permitted use” under the zoning classification for the property; and

B. The commencement of any new activity-use, or the change of one activity-use to another activity-use set forth in the conditional use permit regulations for the zoning district, except that activity-uses may be established without an additional conditional use permit where an existing master conditional use permit explicitly so allows. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2000; Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.02, 1975)

17.60.030 Considerations.
A. In considering an application for a conditional use, the planning commission shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures. In issuing a conditional use permit, the commission may impose requirements and conditions with respect to location, design, siting, maintenance and operation of the use in addition to those expressly provided in this chapter for the particular use, as may be necessary for the protection of the adjacent properties and in the public interest.

B. In approving a use permit, the commission may include such conditions as the commission deems reasonable and necessary under the circumstances to preserve the integrity and character of the district and to secure the general purposes of this title, the general plan, and the local coastal program. Such conditions, without limiting the discretion and authority of the commission, may include time limitations, further architectural and site review, street dedication, and street and drainage improvements.

C. In considering an application for a conditional use involving a material change of an historic feature the planning commission shall weigh the benefits of the proposed change against the detriment to the public welfare caused by a change in the feature. In approving any such change, the commission shall make one of the following findings:

1. The action proposed will not be significantly detrimental to the historic feature in which the change in use is to occur; or

2. The applicant has demonstrated that denial of the application would result in hardship that is so substantial as to outweigh the corresponding benefit to the public of maintenance to the historic feature or structure.

D. In considering an application for a conditional use permit that proposes a new activity-use that will occupy in excess of twelve thousand square feet within one or more buildings, the planning commission will approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed activity-use after considering the following factors:

1. Scale and character of the surrounding area;

2. Traffic generation;

3. Parking impacts;

4. Compatibility to surrounding activity-uses;

5. The size of the proposed activity-use compared to the average size of similar activity-uses located in the surrounding area.

The purpose of this subsection D is to enable and to require the planning commission to apply the above criteria in considering a proposed activity-use; its purpose is not to involve the city in the normal competition that arises between similar businesses.

This subsection D is not applicable:

1. In the area described in municipal Code Section 17.27.040 (“...in a shopping center with a minimum of three hundred thousand square feet gross floor area”); and

2. When the proposed use/activity has already been specifically approved in an applicable master conditional use permit pursuant to Section 17.60.160.

E. Small collection facilities sited in a commercial or industrial zone:

1. May be established only in conjunction with an existing commercial or industrial use which complies with the zoning, building and fire codes for the city;

2. Shall be no larger than five hundred square feet and shall provide parking for removal of the materials and for customers depositing the materials;

3. Shall accept only glass, metal or plastic containers, papers and reusable items. Used motor oil may be accepted with a permit from the Santa Cruz County Environmental Health Department and the Hazardous Wastes Commission;

4. Shall use no power-driven processing equipment, except reverse vending machines;

5. Mobile vending facilities shall be located in a designated area without eliminating the required parking or landscaping;

6. Shall be maintained free of litter and any other undesirable materials. Mobile facilities, at which trucks or containers are removed at the end of each collection day, shall be swept at the end of each collection day;

7. Shall not exceed noise levels of sixty dBA as measured from the property line of residentially zoned or occupied property or otherwise shall not exceed seventy dBA;

8. Attended facilities located within one hundred feet of a property zoned or occupied for residential use shall operate only during the hours of between nine a.m. and seven p.m.;

9. Containers for the twenty-four-hour donation of materials shall be at least thirty feet from any property zoned or occupied for residential use, unless there is a recognized service corridor and acoustical shielding between the containers and the residential use;

10. Containers shall be clearly marked to identify the type of materials which may be deposited; the facility shall be clearly marked to identify the name and telephone number of the facility operator and the hours of operation, and display a notice stating that no material shall be left outside the recycling enclosure or containers;

11. Signs may be provided as follows:

a. Recycling facilities may have identification signs with a maximum of ten square feet, in addition to informational signs required by the city.

b. Signs must be consistent with the character of the location and require city approval;

12. The facility shall not impair the landscaping required by local ordinances for any concurrent use by this title or any permit issued pursuant thereto;

13. Occupation of parking spaces by the facility and by the attendant may not reduce available parking spaces below the minimum number required for the primary host use, unless a study shows that existing parking capacity is not already fully utilized during the time the recycling facility will be on the site.

F. In considering an application for a conditional use permit for a self storage facility, the planning commission will approve, conditionally approve, or deny the use after considering the following factors:

1. The proposed use location may be unsuitable for traditional retail due to access or visibility from the street;

2. The facility is not conducive to traditional retail uses;

3. The proposed development is compatible with the existing land uses in surrounding area; and

4. Streets and thoroughfares are suitable and adequate to serve the proposed development. (Ord. 946 § 2, 2010; Ord. 817 § 3, 2000; Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 677 § 4(A), 1989; Ord. 644 § 5, 1987; Ord. 515 § 6 (part), 1982; Ord. 388 § 18.03, 1975)

17.60.040 Application.
Application for a conditional use permit shall be made by the property owner, or agent thereof, with written approval of the property owner, to the planning commission, on a form prescribed by the commission. (Ord. 388 § 18.04, 1975)

17.60.050 Fee.
The application fee for a conditional use permit shall be established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 388 § 18.05, 1975)

17.60.060 Accompanying maps and drawings.
The application under this chapter shall be accompanied by maps and drawings necessary to demonstrate that conditions set forth in this chapter shall be fulfilled. (Ord. 388 § 18.06, 1975)

17.60.070 Hearing – Required.
A public hearing shall be held to consider all conditional use permit applications, including master use permit applications, but is not required for community development director determinations regarding tenant use permits under Section 17.60.160(E). (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.07, 1975)

17.60.080 Hearing – Notice.
Notice of hearing shall be given as provided in Government Code Section 65091(a). (Ord. 721 § 1, 1991; Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 651 § 1, 1988; Ord. 388 § 18.08, 1975)

17.60.090 Expiration.
A. In any case where a conditional use permit has not been used within two years after the date of granting thereof, (or within such other period of time which may be prescribed in the permit) or within any extension granted pursuant to Section 17.81.160, then without further action the permit will expire. Any interruption or cessation beyond the control of the property owner shall not result in the termination of such right or privilege.

B. For the purposes of this section, a permit shall be deemed to have been “used” when actual substantial, continuous activity has taken place upon the land pursuant to the permit, or in the event the erection of the structure or structures is involved, when sufficient building activity has occurred to cause vested rights to occur under the general principles of state law relating to the vesting of rights in connection with building permits generally. Any issue, doubt or controversy respecting whether or not a permit has been “used” shall be referred to the commission for decision and determination. (Ord. 873 § 24, 2004; Ord. 724 (part), 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.09, 1975)

17.60.100 Appeal – Fee.
A. A determination of the planning commission with respect to a conditional use permit is appealable to the city council, upon written request for a hearing before the council. The written appeal shall give reasons for the appeal and specifically state where the planning commission’s findings or procedures were in error.

B. The fee for filing appeals shall be established by city council resolution. In the absence of such a request being filed within ten days after determination by the planning commission, such determination is final.

C. Within the coastal zone the appeal process shall be consistent with Chapter 17.46 of this title. (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 677 § 4(B), 1989; Ord. 388 § 18.10, 1975)

17.60.110 Appeal – Procedure.
All appeals shall be heard by the city council, as provided in Chapter 2.52. (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.11, 1975)

17.60.120 Revocation of permits.
In any case where the conditions to the granting of a permit have not been or are not complied with, the community development director shall give notice thereof to the permittee, which notice shall specify a reasonable period of time within which to perform said conditions and correct said violation. If the permittee fails to comply with said conditions, or to correct said violation, within the time allowed, notice shall be given to the permittee of intention to revoke such permit at a hearing to be held not less than thirty calendar days after the date of such notice. Following such hearing and, if good cause exists therefor, the planning commission may revoke the permit. (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 698 § 2, 1990; Ord. 608 § 11, 1986; Ord. 388 § 18.12, 1975)

17.60.130 Council review.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the actions of the planning commission are subject to review and modification by the city council unless rights have vested under the permit. The same is true of community development director determinations made under Section 17.60.160E (tenant use permits). (Ord. 713 § 1, 1991; Ord. 388 § 18.13, 1975)

17.60.140 Amendments.
Amendments to a use permit shall be made by new application. (Ord. 388 § 18.14, 1975)

17.60.150 Requirements for conversion of mobile home parks.
For requirements pertinent to subdivisions which will result in the conversion of a mobile home park to another use, see Chapter 17.90 of this code and Government Code Section 66427.4. (Ord. 576 § 4, 1984)

17.60.160 Master conditional use permits – Tenant use permits.
The following requirements pertain to master conditional use permits and tenant use permits:

A. To qualify for a master use permit, more than ten thousand square feet of building must be located upon a parcel, or multiple adjoining parcels under one ownership, at the time the first tenant use permit is utilized.

B. The property must conform to city parking and landscaping requirements.

C. The holder of the master use permit will be renting space to a number of tenants (or itself will be carrying on various businesses), all of which will be using their space for one of the uses allowed in the master use permit. When approving any application the planning commission shall determine the uses allowed by the master use permit by selecting from those principal permitted uses and conditional uses, as listed in the zoning district regulations, which are (without the imposition of conditions not in the master use permit) compatible with the master use and the surrounding properties.

D. Hereafter, prior to the leasing of any space upon the subject property, the holder of the master use permit must inform all prospective tenants, or tenants renewing or extending leases, of the conditions of the master use permit and of the requirements of this section.

E. At the time the master use permit is originally issued, tenant use permits need not be obtained by tenants occupying space on the subject property unless such a requirement is made a precondition of the master use permit approval. After a master use permit has been issued, tenant use permits shall be approved by the community development director upon inspection of the property, and verification that it and its landscaping are in good repair, and that all other conditions of the master use permit are being met. Any adverse determination made by the community development director under this section may be appealed by the applicant to the planning commission within ten calendar days of receipt of notice from the community development director. Such appeals shall be heard de novo. Favorable determinations of either the community development director or planning commission will be so listed on the consent calendar portion of the agenda for the next city council meeting. No tenant use permit will be issued prior to such city council meeting. At such meeting, any member of the council who believes that the application (in order to satisfy the considerations set forth in Section 17.60.030A and B, may need rejection or additional conditions) may demand a de novo review of the application. That review shall occur at such time as is then set by the council. Unless waived by the applicant, at least seven calendar days notice (measured from the date of mailing) shall be given to the applicant prior to the council’s de novo review. If no council member so demands such de novo review, the community development director may forthwith issue the tenant use permit.

F. A tenant use permit may be revoked in the manner provided in Section 17.60.120 if the tenant is the cause of violation of a condition of the master use permit.

G. Any approval of a master use permit may include size limitations for each category of allowable tenant use permits, subject to the following limitations: For master use permits issued after April 15, 2000, no tenant use permits may be issued for any activity-use that will occupy over twelve thousand square feet of building area; for master use permits issued before April 15, 2000, no tenant use permits may be issued for any activity-use that will exceed one thousand five hundred square feet. Above those limits, activity-uses must obtain an ordinary conditional use permit.

H. The planning commission may deny a master conditional use to all, or a portion of, any area described in subsection A, if the planning commission finds that particular circumstances of the property, its existing use, or its proposed use, are such that the ordinary conditional use permit process is necessary for adequate protection of the community’s land use interests. (Ord. 817 § 4, 2000; Ord. 713 § 2, 1991)

This chapter provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.020 Applicability.
A. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts.

B. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. A request for reasonable accommodation shall comply with Section 17.70.040 (Application requirements). (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.030 Notice to the public of availability of accommodation process.
Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters in the planning, zoning and building departments, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public in the planning and building and safety departments. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.040 Application requirements.
A. Application. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an application form provided by the department, or in the form of a letter, to the community development department, and shall contain the following information:

1. The applicant’s name, address and telephone number;

2. The name and address of the property owner;

3. The address of the property for which the request is being made;

4. The current actual use of the property;

5. The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under the Acts;

6. Description of the requested accommodation and the regulation(s), policy or procedure for which accommodation is sought;

7. Why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual.

B. Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval (including conditional use permit, design review, general plan amendment, zone change, annexation, etc.), then the applicant shall file the information required by subsection A together for concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.

C. A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual’s obligation to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.

D. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the jurisdiction will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.050 Review authority.
A. Community Development Director. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the community development director (director) if no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation.

B. Other Review Authority. A request for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.060 Review procedure.
A. Director Review. The director, or designee, shall make a written determination within forty-five days and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in compliance with Section 17.70.070 (Findings and decision).

If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may request further information from the applicant consistent with fair housing laws, specifying in detail the information that is required. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the forty-five-day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request.

B. Other Review Authority. The written determination on whether to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the authority responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application in compliance with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary review. The written determination to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in compliance with Section 17.70.070 (Findings and decision). (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.070 Findings and decision.
A. Findings. The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following factors:

1. Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual disabled under the Acts;

2. Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts;

3. Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city;

4. Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning;

5. Potential impact on surrounding uses;

6. Physical attributes of the property and structures; and

7. Other reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit.

B. Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection A. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.080 Appeal of determination.
A determination by the reviewing authority to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation may be appealed to the planning commission. All appeals must be made within ten working days of the reviewing authority’s decision and must be in writing. All appeals shall contain a statement of the grounds of the appeal.

If an individual needs assistance in filing an appeal on an adverse decision, the jurisdiction will provide assistance to ensure that the appeals process is accessible. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

17.70.090 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid and/or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 965 § 1, 2011)

*    Prior ordinance history: Ords. 388, 563, 594 and 692.

17.72.010 Purpose.
The purpose of zoning is to confine certain classes of structures and activities to particular areas and to bring structures or activities into conformance with zoning designations. The purpose of this chapter is to further that general objective while at the same time, respecting constitutional property rights, preventing disproportionate loss of investment, and preventing deterioration of structures or areas which often occurs because repair and maintenance is not cost effective towards the end of an amortization period. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.020 Applicability.
The regulations set forth in this chapter apply to all zoning districts. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.030 Definitions.
“Nonconforming activity (use)” is defined as an activity, business or enterprise which was legal at the time it was established but which is not presently a permitted or conditional use in the zoning district where the activity, business or enterprise is located or does not conform to current parking requirements. In residential zones it also means having a greater density of dwelling units than is presently allowed in the district.

“Nonconforming structure” is defined as a structure which does not meet the current development standards for the district in which the structure is located. Development standards include, but are not limited to: setbacks, height or lot coverage regulations of the district, but do not include standards contained in the Uniform Codes, such as the Building Code, adopted in Section 15.14.010, because those codes contain their own specific regulations regarding structures that do not meet current requirements. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.040 Nonconforming activity regulations for unimproved lots.
A nonconforming activity (as defined in Section 17.72.030(A)) on a parcel which does not involve structures totaling over four hundred square feet, will be allowed to continue for five years from the time it became nonconforming. If the activity stops for more than ninety days, the activity may not be reinstated. A determination regarding the ninety-day time period shall be made by the community development director based on the evidence presented. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.050 Continuing nonconforming activities (except in R-1 zones) on improved lots.
A nonconforming activity, as defined in Section 17.72.030(A), involving structures totaling over four hundred square feet on a parcel in any zoning district but R-1, shall be allowed to continue but the area in which the activity is carried out may not be enlarged. However, if the nonconformity is confined to not meeting current parking standards, Section 17.51.135 applies. Nonconforming uses/activities which are inactive for a period of ninety days shall be deemed to have ended and may not be reinstated. (See Section 17.72.080.) A determination of the ninety-day cessation shall be made by the community development director based on the evidence presented. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.060 Nonconforming activities and structures on improved R-1 parcels.
A. Amortization. Nonconforming activities in R-1 zones must be discontinued on June 26, 2019 or fifty years from the date the activity first became nonconforming, whichever is later, except as provided in subsections B and C below:

B. Duplex Activity. Nonconforming duplex activities may continue indefinitely but the structures cannot be enlarged. They may be structurally altered or rebuilt only as allowed under Sections 17.72.070 and 17.72.080.

C. Residential Projects With More Than Two Units. Owners of parcels having more than two dwelling units which are nonconforming only because they exceed the current density standard may apply to the city council for one or more extensions of the fifty-year amortization period. The city council shall only grant an extension if able to make findings that: in this particular situation, the appearance, condition and management of the property is such that the property is not greatly detrimental to the single-family residential character of the neighborhood in which it is located; the extension is necessary in order to prevent a major economic loss to the property owner and to lessen deterioration; and that all reasonable conditions have been imposed for the purpose of repairing dilapidation and bringing, or keeping, the property up to neighborhood standards. Extensions granted under this section shall be at least fifty years from the date the application is granted. (Ord. 764 § 1, 1994; Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.070 Permissible structural alterations.
Structural alterations of nonconforming structures, as defined in Section 17.03.640, shall be limited as follows: at the time application for a structural alteration is made, the building official shall determine the cost at prevailing contractor rates of the total work of the improvements involved, excluding permit costs, landscaping costs and architectural costs. If that cost, added to the costs (similarly calculated) of other work involving structural alterations, commenced in the preceding five years, exceeds eighty percent of the present fair market value of the structure (as it would be without any of the structural alterations), the proposed structural alterations may not be made. (Ord. 873 § 11 (part), 2004; Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.080 Destruction by fire, explosion, flood or other disaster.
Buildings which are destroyed by fire, explosion, flood or other disaster will be allowed to be rebuilt as long as there is no increase in size of structures or intensity of activity and the cost of repair, excluding permits and architectural costs, measured by prevailing contractor rates, does not exceed ninety percent of the fair market value of the structure as it existed before the disaster. (Ord. 873 § 11 (part), 2004; Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

17.72.090 Transient rental uses.
Transient rental uses (defined in Section 17.03.686) are prohibited in residential zones. By virtue of Ordinance No. 692, the amortization period has expired for any transient rental uses which were nonconforming when Ordinance No. 692 was adopted in 1990. (Ord. 761 § 1, 1993)

The district boundaries are either streets, alleys, or as otherwise shown, and where the designations on the zoning map accompanying and made a part of this title indicate the various districts are approximately bounded by streets or alleys, said streets and alleys shall be construed to be the boundaries of such district.

B. Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries shall be construed to be lot lines, and where the designations of the zoning map accompanying and made part of this title indicating the various districts are approximately bounded by lot lines, said lot lines shall be construed to be boundaries of said districts, unless said boundaries are indicated on the map.

C. In unsubdivided property and where a district boundary divides a lot, the locations of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map.

D. A symbol indicating the classification of property on the zoning map shall in each instance apply to the whole of the area within the district boundaries.

E. Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the property formerly in said street or alley shall be included within the district or adjoining property thereto and shall be subject to the regulations applicable to said district. In the event said street or alley was a boundary between two or more different districts, the new district boundary shall be the former centerline of such vacated street or alley and shall be subject to the regulations applicable to the abutting properties.

F. Where uncertainty exists, the planning commission shall, by written decision, determine the location of the zone boundary and shall so advise the city council of its decision. (Ord. 388 § 25.02, 1975)

17.81.040 Rules governing open spaces.
Except as provided by the adjustment procedure set forth in Article 20 the following rules shall govern the provisions of open spaces about buildings:

A. A building site as defined in this title is established on each usable lot, each such building site being surrounded on all sides by open spaces in the form of yards, the minimum widths and dimensions of which are set forth in the regulations of the district in which such lot is located. Each dwelling and all necessary buildings hereafter erected, rebuilt, altered, enlarged or moved upon any lot shall be so planned or placed as to occupy only the building site established by these regulations for such lot.

B. Any lot or parcel of land in one ownership having an area sufficient for more than one dwelling, or any lot shown upon a subdivision map of record in the office of the county recorder prior to adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, may be used for a dwelling and a building permit may be issued for such use, provided the owner thereof who changes or intends to change any existing lot line or lines or to establish new lot lines obtains approval of the city planning commission pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act and the city regulations.

C. No building, structure or land shall be used, nor shall any building or other structure be erected, moved, raised, altered, enlarged, reconstructed, extended, or rebuilt, nor shall any open spaces surrounding any building be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity with the open space and area requirements established by this title for the district in which such building is located or as permitted by a variance duly authorized by the planning commission.

D. No yard or other open space provided about any building for the purpose of complying with the regulations of this title shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building or structure.

E. In the Soquel Creek area within the city limits, the following shall apply: All bulkheads shall be constructed in a rustic manner and finished in wood. All handrails on decks shall not exceed forty-two inches in height, nor shall the space between the deck and the handrails be filled in creating a solid appearance. Only two freestanding lights shall be allowed for each deck and to a maximum height of eight feet.

F. The Soquel Creek Riverview Pedestrian Pathway, which extends from the Stockton Avenue Bridge along the eastern side of Soquel Creek, under the Railroad Trestle, to 427 Riverview Avenue, where it follows a drainage easement out to Riverview Avenue shall be maintained as a public pathway at the existing width as documented by the March 2005 survey completed by the city of Capitola, which is on file with the city clerk or no less than four feet in width, whichever is greater. On or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this subsection, new development, decks, fencing, landscaping and other improvements shall not encroach on the Soquel Creek Riverview Pathway. Surface variations (i.e., brick, decomposed granite and other surfaces) are acceptable. Property owners shall trim and maintain landscaping so that it does not encroach upon or narrow the width of the pathway to less than four feet. As used in this subsection the term “pathway” shall refer to that undeveloped area within which the pedestrian walking surface (comprised of brick, decomposed granite and other surface materials) is located. (Ord. 885 § 1, 2005; Ord. 388 § 25.03, 1975)

17.81.050 Public facilities.
A. Outside the coastal zone public facilities as listed in Sections 17.42.040, 17.42.050 and 17.42.060 are conditional uses in all zoning districts.

B. Within the coastal zone, public facilities should generally be restricted to the PF public facilities district. In the parks/open space, central village, and visitor serving districts, no public facilities shall be permitted except those which are dependent on the specific resources of the site or are related to the enhancement of the basic zoning district uses and are consistent with the land use plan. (Ord. 691 § 14, 1990; Ord. 685 § 2, 1989; Ord. 388 § 25.04, 1975)

17.81.105 Self-service and partial-service gasoline stations.
A. “Full service gas stations” means stations offering: gas, air, water, oil, and window-washing performed by a service station attendant, light mechanical repairs; public restrooms; and replacement supplies such as fan belts, water hoses, windshield wiper blades, tires, transmission oil and brake fluid.

B. “Completely self-service gas stations” means stations which offer neither attendant gas pumping and window washing, nor light mechanical repairs.

C. “Partial-service gas stations” means stations which offer either the services of a mechanic, or attendant gas pumping and window-washing, but less than the full range of services and supplies available at a full-service gas station.

D. “Split-island” means an island of gas pumps in a full-service or partial-service station where attendants are not available to perform services such as pumping gas, washing windows, or checking fluid levels.

E. No full-service station may convert to a partial-service station, or to a self-service station, or to a station wherein more than fifty percent of its pumps are at split-islands, without first securing a conditional use permit.

F. No partial-service station may convert to a self-service station or to a station wherein more than fifty percent of its pumps are at split-islands without first securing conditional use permits.

G. In any application to convert under subsections E or F, or in any application to establish a new gas service station the planning commission, (in addition to district regulations and the requirements of Chapter 17.60) shall consider whether the proposal would adversely affect public health, safety and welfare by diminishing the level of repair services, attendant services, or restrooms available to the public. (Ord. 577, 1984)

17.81.110 Accessory structures.
A. All accessory structures eighty or more square feet or with electrical or plumbing fixtures shall require building permits.

B. One accessory structure eighty square feet or less and eight feet or less in height shall be permitted without a building or design permit and may be located in the side or rear setback of a residential lot.

The variance procedure, as provided in Chapter 17.66, shall only apply to the second or more accessory structure(s). (Ord. 882 § 1, 2005; Ord. 873 § 17, 2004; Ord. 388 § 25.10, 1975)

17.81.120 Solar energy systems as a permitted use.
The use of solar systems, including solar collectors, storage facilities, and distribution components for the purpose of providing energy for space heating and cooling and domestic hot water heating, is a permitted use in all zones within the city so long as those systems are a part of the main structure. (Ord. 517 § 1, 1982)

17.81.130 Solar energy systems as a conditional use.
Solar energy systems which are not part of the main structure and are incidental to one or a group of structures in a nearby vicinity shall be a conditional use in all zones within the city. (Ord. 517 § 1, 1982)

17.81.140 Dish antennae prohibited.
No dish-type antennae may be placed or erected (a) in front yards or in corner lot side yards in residential zones; or (b) at any location in other zones except those antennae which receive architectural and site approval pursuant to Section 17.63.030. (Ord. 589 § 2, 1985)

17.81.150 Recovery of monitoring or deposit expenses.
Whenever a cash deposit is necessary to ensure the performance of any condition as a part of any approval, or whenever staff time is required to monitor compliance with any such condition, such as a requirement of landscape maintenance, a fee may be imposed equal to the actual or estimated cost (including but not limited to staff time) to the city of handling of a deposit or monitoring compliance with a condition. (Ord. 668, 1988)

17.81.160 Extension of permit expiration dates.
A. Purpose of Extensions. As the California Court of Appeal has observed at 204 Cal. App. 3rd 1124, the purpose of providing for automatic expiration of development permits is mainly “to prevent the reservation of land for future purposes when the permittee has no good faith intent to presently commence upon the proposed use. Such reservations would cripple the city’s ability to change requirements as circumstances or planning policies change.

B. Permit Period Extension. Permittees, either at the time of originally obtaining the permit, or at some time prior to its expiration, may apply for an extension of the expiration period. The application to extend shall be made to the body which actually approved the permit. When the original permit was, by appeal or otherwise, heard by the city council, such applications shall be made to the city council.

C. Extensions Related to City-imposed Conditions. The city may grant an extension of the otherwise applicable expiration date if it is imposing a condition which significantly delays the applicant from commencing the proposed use. The period of any such extension shall be reasonably related to the cause of the delay.

D. Coastal Permit Extensions. See Section 17.46.120(B).

E. Other Permit Extensions. For other situations than those covered by subsections B or C of this section, the applicant may apply for one or more extension(s), each of which shall be for one year. Such requests may be granted upon a finding that there has been no relevant substantial change of circumstances, regulations or planning policies. (Ord. 722, 1991; Ord. 707, 1991)

17.81.170 Notice of public hearing.
A. Government Code Section 65090 requires notice pursuant to Government Code Section 6061 (publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the city at least ten days prior to the hearing). That method of notice shall be given in the following situations:

1. General and specific plan adoption or amendment (Government Code Sections 65353, 65355, 65750-65763, 65919.4, 65962);

17.90.010 Findings and declarations of purpose.
A. Mobile home owners make considerable investments in purchasing, maintaining, and improving their mobile homes, but must rent a space for the home in a mobile home park and cannot easily move the mobile home due to the shortage of mobile home spaces and the high cost and risk of damage involved in moving a mobile home. In recognition of the unique situation and vulnerability of mobile home owners created by these facts, the State Mobile Home Residency Law, Civil Code Section 798, et seq., and Government Code Sections 65863.7 and 66427.4, limit the grounds on which mobile home owners may be evicted from a mobile home park, protect their right to sell their mobile homes in a place in a mobile home park and authorize local jurisdictions to impose reasonable measures to mitigate the adverse impacts on displaced mobile home owners when a mobile home park closes or converts to another use. Pursuant to these state laws, this chapter provides a procedure and standards for reviewing applications for change of use or closure of mobile home parks, determining reasonable mitigation measures and protecting residents from tactics such as intimidation and excessive rent increases, designed to pressure mobile home owners to relocate without receiving assistance pursuant to this chapter. Without such assistance mobile home owners may lose the investment in their homes, which may be their only asset, and may not be able to relocate to decent, affordable housing.

B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to mean that the city supports any change of use of any mobile home park. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:

“Applicant” means a person or entity who has filed an application for change of use of a mobile home park.

“Change of use” includes all activities specified in Section 798.10 of the California Civil Code and amendments to the general plan or any applicable specific plan, rezoning of property, land use permits, such as a conditional use permit or a variance, tentative parcel or tentative tract maps, and building permits when the effect of the change will be to decrease the number of spaces available for mobile home habitation.

“Change without new use” refers to what Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(2) describes as a “change of use [requiring] no local governmental permit” [other than approval of the RIR].

“Comparable housing” means housing which, on balance, is comparable in floor area, number of bedrooms, and amenities, proximity to public transportation, shopping, schools, employment opportunities and medical services and other relevant factors to the mobile home to which comparison is being made.

“Comparable mobile home park” means a mobile home park substantially equal in terms of park condition, amenities and other relevant factors, including, but not limited to, proximity to public transportation, shopping, medical services, employment opportunities and schools.

“Director” means the community development director.

“Eligible mobile home resident” or “eligible resident” means a mobile home resident whose mobile home was located in a mobile home park on the date of an application for change of use. Eligible resident includes the spouse, parents, children and grandchildren of the eligible resident when those persons resided in the mobile home on the date of the application.

“Legal owner” means any person or entity having an ownership interest in a mobile home other than the registered owner, such as a lender or mortgagor.

“Mobile home” has the meaning set forth in Section 798.3 of the California Civil Code.

“Mobile home owner” means the registered owner or registered owners of a mobile home, regardless of the number of such owners or the form of such ownership.

“Mobile home park” or “park” has the meaning set forth in Section 798.4 of the California Civil Code.

“Mobile home park owner” or “park owner” means the person, persons or entity that owns a mobile home park and includes any person authorized by the park owner to seek approval of an application for change of use or respond to a rent review petition filed pursuant to this chapter.

“Mobile home owner” means a mobile home owner who resides in the mobile home he or she owns. Unless the context indicates otherwise, it includes the mobile home owner’s spouse, parents, children and grandchildren who reside in the mobile home.

“Mobile home tenant” or “tenant” is a person who occupies a mobile home within a mobile home park pursuant to a bona fide lease or rental agreement and who, during his or her tenancy, was not the owner of that mobile home.

“Handicapped mobile home resident” means a mobile home resident with any medically determinable physical or mental impairment as demonstrated by a finding of a state or federal agency or a medical certificate, or who requires special care facilities in the mobile home or special care equipment, such as, but not limited to, a wheelchair.

“Low income” means an income of eighty percent or less of current median income as established annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the statistical area in which Capitola is located, as adjusted for household size. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.025 Application and relocation impact report (RIR) – Duty to file.
Prior to a change of use of a mobile home park, a relocation impact report (RIR) complying with the requirements of this chapter must be filed with the director. It is the park owner’s responsibility to comply with the notice requirements of subsections g(l) and (2) of Civil Code Section 798.56. Because the Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(2) notice cannot be given until after the approval of both the project and the sufficiency of the (RIR), the park owner is encouraged to consult with staff (especially if any waiver of Municipal Code Section 17.90.030 requirements will be requested) early in the process about the contents of the RIR. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.030 Contents of relocation impact report.
All relocation impact reports (RIRs) required by this chapter, Civil Code Section 798.56 or Government Code Section 65863.7 shall contain the following information, unless the director determines that any of the following is unduly burdensome to produce when weighed against its informative value:

A. A detailed description of any proposed or change of use, or change without new use;

B. A timetable for conversion of the park;

C. A legal description of the park;

D. The number of spaces in the park, length of occupancy by the current occupant of each space and current rental rate for each space;

E. The date of manufacture and size of each mobile home;

F. Appraisals addressing relevant issues identified by the director. A qualified appraiser shall be selected by the city and the cost of the appraisals shall be borne by the applicant. The appraisals shall identify those mobile homes which cannot be moved due to type, age or other considerations. Appraisal information shall be provided on the effect upon the homeowner’s investment in the mobile home, such as the change in value of effected mobile homes that would result from the proposed change in use;

G. The results of questionnaires to all homeowners/occupants regarding the following: whether the occupant owns or rents, whether this is the only residence, occupants’ ages, whether the occupants have disabilities that would be aggravated by the moving process, the purchase date and price paid by the mobile home owner, the costs incurred by the mobile home owner in improving the home, and the amount and relevant terms of any remaining mortgage. Answering such questionnaire shall be voluntary;

H. The name and mailing address of each eligible resident, mobile home tenant, mobile home resident, resident mobile home owner and legal owner of a mobile home in the park;

I. The purchase price of condominiums similar in size to the mobile homes within a reasonable distance, and the rental rates and moving costs involved in moving to an apartment or other rental unit within a reasonable distance including, but not limited to, fees charged by moving companies and any requirement for payment of the first and last month’s rent and security deposits;

J. A list of comparable mobile home parks within a twenty-mile radius and a list of comparable mobile home parks within a radius of twenty-five to fifty miles of the applicant’s mobile home park. For each comparable park, the list should, if possible, state the criteria of that park for accepting relocated mobile homes, rental rates and the name, address and telephone number of the park representative having authority to accept relocated homes, including any written commitments from mobile home park owners willing to accept displaced mobile homes. The purpose of the requirements in this subsection are to provide information necessary to create appropriate relocation compensation. It is not meant to suggest that the city, in any sense, favors tenants having to move out of any mobile home park in Capitola.

K. Estimates from two moving companies as to the minimum and per mile cost of moving each mobile home, including tear-down and set-up of mobile homes and moving of improvements such as porches, carports, patios and other moveable amenities installed by the residents. Said moving companies shall be approved by the director prior to inclusion in the final RIR.

L. Proposed measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of the conversion upon the mobile home park residents.

M. Identification of a relocation specialist to assist residents in finding relocation spaces and alternate housing. The specialist shall be selected by the applicant, subject to the city’s approval, and shall be paid for by the applicant. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.040 Filing of relocation impact report.
An RIR shall not be considered filed, within the meaning of Government Code Section 65863.7, until the applicant has caused to be submitted to the director both a draft RIR which applicant believes meets the requirements of Municipal Code Section 17.90.030, and a written statement that such draft RIR is being filed pursuant to Government Code Section 65863.7. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.045 Refusal to review relocation impact report.
If the city attorney determines that the proposed change of use or change without new use would be illegal, the director shall not process the RIR until and unless a court of competent jurisdiction rules that the proposed use would be legal. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.050 Notice to new occupants regarding pending change in status of park.
When an application for change of use of a mobile home park (or for city approval of a RIR) has been filed with the director, the applicant shall thereafter, in addition to Civil Code Section 798.56 (g) (1) notices, give notice to all known prospective mobile home purchasers and prospective mobile home tenants within the park, and in all cases prior to execution of any new rental agreement, that the application for change of use has been filed. The park owner shall obtain a signed acknowledgment of receipt of such notice from each prospective purchaser or tenant and file it with the director. If the prospective purchaser or tenant refuses to sign, a dependable record of delivery of notice shall be maintained by the park owner. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.060 Application for exemption from relocation assistance obligations.
A. Any person who files an application for change of use may file an application for total or partial exemption from the obligation to provide relocation assistance.

B. If such application for exemption is filed, notice thereof, containing the information contained in the application, shall be given pursuant to subsections B and C of Section 17.90.070.

C. An application for total exemption may be made on one of two grounds.

1. That imposition of any relocation obligations would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternate uses;

2. The park is exempt from the requirement of relocation assistance under state law governing changes of use of mobile home park.

D. Any application for partial exemption shall state that it is made on grounds either:

1. That imposition of particular relocation obligations would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternate uses; or

2. That it would exceed limitations imposed by Government Code Section 65863.7(e). The application shall specify the particular relocation obligations which would cause this result.

E. An application for exemption made pursuant to subsections (C)(1) and (D)(1) of this section shall contain, at a minimum, an estimate of the value of the subject property by a qualified real estate appraiser if the park were permitted to be developed for the use proposed in the application for change of use, or other use consistent with applicable zoning, and an estimate of the value of such park by such appraiser if use of the property as a mobile home park is continued. An application for exemption pursuant to subsection (C) (2) of this section shall specify the provisions of state law providing the claimed exemption and documentation demonstrating entitlement to such exemption.

F. If an exemption is granted after the applicant has purportedly provided Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(2) notice, renoticing will be necessary. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.070 Application for change of use – Public hearing – Findings.
A. Upon the filing of an RIR, the director shall examine the same and advise the applicant in writing within thirty days after receipt thereof whether it is complete. When an application and RIR have been accepted as complete, the director shall set a time, date and place for a hearing before the planning commission not later than sixty days after the date of acceptance. Because certain required information in an RIR (e.g., appraisals, tenant data) cannot be obtained until after filing an application for change of use, the initial application for change of use and RIR should contain all pertinent available information in order to start the process of obtaining the information required for a complete application and/or RIR.

B. Not less than thirty days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the planning commission, the park owner shall, by certified mail or personal delivery, transmit to the registered and legal owner of each mobile home occupying a site within the mobile home park and to each resident a copy of the approved RIR and notice (in form approved by the director) of the date, time and place of the public hearing on the application.

C. Not less than fifteen days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the planning commission on the RIR, the park owner shall file with the director a verification that he or she has complied with the requirements of this section pertaining to notices and transmittal of copies of the RIR and with all notice requirements in Government Code Section 65863.7, et seq. The form and manner of such verification shall be subject to approval by the city attorney.

D. Planning Commission Hearing, Findings and Advisory Decision. Upon review of an application for change of use or exemption and the RIR and consideration of the written and oral evidence received at the hearing, the commission shall render its findings and recommendation to the city council by resolution within ninety-five days of the date the application and RIR were accepted as complete. In rendering its advisory decision, the commission may recommend reasonable measures not exceeding the reasonable costs, or estimates thereof, of relocation to mitigate the adverse impacts on eligible residents displaced by the change of use or mobile home owners who may have to move their mobile homes, which may include, but are not limited to the following:

1. Payment of the cost of physically moving the mobile home to a new site, including tear-down and setup of mobile homes, including, but not limited to, movable improvements such as patios, carports and porches;

2. Payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any increase in security deposit at the new mobile home park which the resident or tenant lacks the ability to pay;

3. Payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any differential between rental rates at the closing mobile home park and the new mobile home park during the first year of the new tenancy;

4. For those mobile home residents who move to apartments or other rental housing alternatives, payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any differential in the rental rate between the closing park and the comparable housing, requirements for payment of security deposits and cleaning fees. Mobile home households may be compensated based on the number of bedrooms in the mobile home so that a one bedroom mobile home may be compensated based on a one bedroom apartment, a two bedroom mobile home based on a two bedroom apartment, etc.;

5. Provision of a replacement space within a reasonable distance of the closing mobile home park;

6. For residents whose mobile home cannot be relocated to a comparable park within a fifty-mile radius of the closing mobile home park, payment of a lump sum based upon consideration of the value of the mobile home, including resident improvements (i.e., landscaping, porches, carports, etc.), any increase in mortgage obligations of the resident on the mobile home, and the costs of purchasing a mobile home on-site in a comparable park or acquiring other comparable replacement housing;

7. The park owner shall make the monetary payments contemplated in this subsection a reasonable period of time (to be set by the city council) in advance of the actual relocation of a resident or homeowner. The resident or homeowner shall not be under a legal obligation to relocate by the method used to measure mitigation costs.

E. Time periods in this chapter may be extended as necessary to comply with C.E.Q.A. or the Coastal Act.

F. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, the total of the mitigation measures required shall be subject to and shall not exceed the limitation in Government Code Section 65863.7 which provides: “the steps taken to mitigate shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation.”

G. City Council Hearing, Findings and Decision.

1. The application for change of use and any application for exemption shall be set for hearing before the city council within forty-five days of the date of the planning commission decision recommending the mitigation measures to be imposed on the change of use of a park or exemption from the provision of relocation assistance.

2. The city council, after review and consideration of the application, the RIR and the written and oral evidence received at the hearing, shall by resolution render its findings and decision within eighty days of the date of the planning commission decision.

3. The city council may impose reasonable measures not exceeding the reasonable costs of relocation to mitigate the adverse impacts of the change of use on eligible mobile home residents pursuant to subsections (D) and (E) of this section. The decision of the city council shall be final. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1094.6, the statute of limitations for bringing a judicial challenge to any decision concerning a change of use of mobile home park shall be ninety days and notice of the city’s decision to the applicant, park owner and affected residents shall include notice that the ninety-day statute of limitations in 1094.6 is applicable. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.080 Measures to prevent avoidance of relocation assistance obligations.
A. If any change of use or RIR approval application is withdrawn or denied, those previously given notices or announcements shall be so informed in writing by the park owner.

B. No prospective mobile home resident or existing mobile home resident may be required to sign a waiver, or a lease or rental agreement which includes a waiver, of their rights under this chapter. Any waiver of rights under this chapter by such a mobile home resident shall be deemed invalid unless the resident or prospective resident and the park owner obtain the prior approval of the waiver from the director, who may grant such approval only upon a finding that the waiver is voluntary and was made after being fully informed of the terms of this chapter. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.090 Compliance with relocation assistance required as a condition of approval of a change of use.
A. The applicant shall execute and record a certificate, and file proof thereof with the director, accepting the mitigation measures imposed on the approval of a change of use within ninety days of the final council action approving the change of use and shall give the six- or twelve-month notice of the termination of tenancy and closure of the park required by Civil Code Section 798.56(g) within one hundred twenty days of that action. An approval of a change of use shall automatically become null and void if the certificate accepting the conditions is not filed and executed within ninety days of the date of the approval of the change of use and the notice of termination of tenancy has not been given within one hundred twenty days of that resolution. All mitigation measures imposed on the approval of a change of use shall be fully performed as to each resident prior to that resident’s required vacation of the mobile home park, unless otherwise provided in the mitigation measure. No eligible resident shall be required to vacate a mobile home space unless the applicant is in full compliance with all mitigation measures imposed pertaining to such resident, and has otherwise fulfilled the notice requirements of the California Mobile Home Residency Law relating to termination of tenancy.

B. No building permit shall be issued for the development of any real property which has been, or is being, converted from a mobile home park pursuant to this chapter unless and until the city has adopted a resolution approving the change of use and the park owner has fully complied with the relocation assistance required by that resolution. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.100 Modification and revocation of approved change of use.
A. Modification.

1. After a change of use has been approved and after the applicant has executed and recorded a certificate of acceptance of the conditions of any approval, modification of the mitigation measures imposed, including additions and deletions, may be considered upon the filing of a written application by the applicant. Modification may be granted on the grounds that there has been a change in circumstances or new information, which could not reasonably have been known or considered at the time of the hearings on the application, has become available. Examples of such new information or changed circumstances include, but are not limited to, revised plans by the applicant and a change in the availability of relocation spaces. Modification shall not be granted when it would unreasonably prejudice the ability of the residents to relocate to comparable spaces or comparable alternate housing.

2. Any application for modification shall be subject to the notice and hearing procedures set forth in Sections 17.90.070 and 17.90.080. The decision in connection with a modification request shall take place as with the initial approval.

B. Revocation.

1. The city council may initiate revocation proceedings on the grounds that the park owner or applicant has violated the provisions of this chapter or the terms of the approval of the change of use. The approval shall specify the grounds asserted for revocation of the approval of the change of use by the park and shall set a hearing before the city council to consider the revocation not sooner than forty-five and not later than sixty days after the date of the approval.

2. Notice of revocation proceeding shall be sent to the park owner by certified mail or personal delivery together with notice that any response by the park must be filed at least twenty days prior to the date set for the revocation hearing.

3. The city council shall render its findings and decision concerning revocation within ninety days after initiating revocation proceedings. (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.110 Expiration and extension of approval.
A. Approval of a change of use shall become null and void if the notice of termination of tenancy has not been given within the time provided in Section 17.90.090 and relocation pursuant to the conditions of approval has not occurred within twelve months of the effective date of the approval of the change of use, unless otherwise extended as provided in subsection (B) of this section, or unless otherwise provided in the resolution approving it.

B. Upon application by the park owner filed with the director on or before the time provided for giving the notice of termination or the expiration of the approval of the change of use, the date for giving notice and the approval may be extended by the city council upon a showing of good cause. The request may be denied if the council finds that the park owner has unreasonably delayed implementation of the mitigation measures or that further delay will result in prejudice or further adverse impacts upon eligible residents remaining in the park. Approval of an extension may be conditioned on reasonable measures designed to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from the delay. The application for extension shall be subject to the notice and hearing procedures set forth in Section 17.90.100(B). (Ord. 759 (part), 1993)

17.90.120 Change without new use.
Government Code Section 65863.7 and Civil Code Section 798.56 require submission and approval of an RIR even in situations where no other local government permit is required for the contemplated change of use or change without new use.

17.93.060    Severability.

17.93.010 Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to prevent the city of Capitola from becoming a logistical base for offshore oil drilling. (Ord. 632 § l (part), 1987)

17.93.020 Findings.
The city has long opposed efforts to open the central California coast to offshore drilling. Onshore support of offshore oil drilling would be detrimental to the economy and environment of the city. The city is a tourist attraction and thus its resources and beauty are shared with people from all over the United States. If offshore drilling were to commence with onshore facilities located within the city, much of the resources and beauty that is shared with the people of our great nation would be lost.

A. Effect on Economy. The city is partly dependent upon retail and visitor serving trades. A recent study by Economic Research Associates of San Francisco found that the beaches in the greater Santa Cruz area were the main attraction for eighty percent of all visitors. The U.S. Department of Interior’s Five-Year Impact Statement states, conservatively, that there is a forty percent chance of two oil spills in this area of one thousand barrel magnitude and ocean currents would bring oil to Capitola beaches, which would, therefore, have significant economic consequences for the city.

B. Oil Spills. The technology does not exist to contain or clean up an oil slick on the water. Oil is likely to land on Capitola beaches, as stated in the above report, requiring massive cleanup efforts which would include a large expenditure of city funds and staff time, and volunteer time from city residents.

C. Endangered or Threatened Species. There are at least twenty-six endangered or threatened species that reside on the central California coast including the Southern Sea Otter. Oil spills, routine discharges or toxic byproducts, air pollution, and noise impacts will pose a danger to these species.

D. Infrastructure. The city does not have the infrastructure available to handle increased traffic, especially large trucks, associated with onshore facilities. Traffic is already a problem.

E. Ambience of the Village. There is significant historical, educational and economic value to the Capitola Village. Recently, utilities were undergrounded to help preserve the charm of the village. Offshore drilling and onshore facilities associated with it would dramatically alter the nature and ambience of the village, thereby causing significant effects on the city.

F. Space Availability in the City. There is a relatively small amount of space available with the city (approximately two and one-half square miles). Among these parcels are the Rispin Mansion and others, which are inappropriate for onshore facilities and cannot be adapted for onshore facilities without ruining them.

G. The federal government has proposed to open up virtually the entire California coastline to offshore oil and gas exploration and development, including the coastline off of Santa Cruz County.

H. Coastal areas off central California have been determined high priority areas for offshore oil and gas exploration and development by various multinational oil companies.

I. Offshore oil and gas development off the coast of Capitola would have the following significant effects upon the city:

J. If offshore oil and gas development occurs off the Capitola coast, significant new air pollution is inevitable. One drill ship produces approximately the same amount of air pollution as twenty-three thousand cars driving fifty miles per day. Despite this fact, the federal government does not presently require that offshore oil and gas developments comply with state and local air pollution.

K. Offshore oil and gas development off the Capitola coast would inevitably result in the discharge of large volumes of highly toxic drilling muds into the ocean floor. These toxic materials would degrade the sensitive marine environment, put all forms of marine life at greater risk, and pose a threat to human beings who may later eat the fish contaminated with accumulated toxic material.

L. Offshore oil and gas development off the Capitola coast would put the existing local economy in jeopardy because such development would significantly and substantially interfere with the operation of the local fishing industry.

M. Noisy helicopter traffic would become a significant irritant to Capitola residents.

N. The coastal zone is subject to earthquake hazards. Geologic and historic records indicate that earthquakes have and will occur in this area. An earthquake could be accompanied by a surface rupture, ground shaking and ground failure. The location of oil and gas support facilities in this geologically unstable area would well result in an environmental disaster.

1. Rather than consuming offshore oil and gas resources now, our nation should conserve these resources, since they are nonrenewable. Moreover, the accelerated production and expenditure of hydrocarbon fuels aggravates the global warming trend, a trend which may have long term adverse impacts on Capitola and, in particular, on coastal communities which could be subject to an inundation if global oceans continue to rise as a result of polar icecap melting. Our nation should develop a national energy strategy based on energy conservation emphasizing the increasing use of renewable energy sources such as geothermal production and reinjection. Instead, the federal government has presently reduced or eliminated efforts to increase energy conservation and to develop renewable energy sources, at the same time that it is attempting to increase the development of nonrenewable energy sources like offshore oil and gas. The citizens of Capitola are willing and able to do their part in conserving energy and in developing a society less dependent on nonrenewable fossil fuel resources. (Ord. 632 § l (part), 1987)

17.93.030 Implementation.
There shall be no construction, reconstruction, operation or maintenance of any commercial or industrial facility within the city, including, but not limited to, oil or gas storage facilities, pipe and drilling materials, or equipment repair or storage facilities, which operates directly in support of any offshore oil or gas exploration, development, drilling, pumping or production; nor shall there be any construction, reconstruction, or operation of facilities to process any oil or natural gas taken or removed from any offshore oil or gas drilling or pumping operations. (Ord. 632 § 1, 1987)

17.93.040 Zoning changes.
The city council in adopting this chapter suggests that:

A. This chapter shall not be amended nor repealed without a vote of the people.

B. No zoning changes to accommodate onshore support facilities for offshore oil or gas exploration, development, drilling or pumping or production shall be enacted without a vote of the people of the city of Capitola. (Ord. 632 § 1, 1987)

17.93.050 Effect of adoption.
Adoption of this chapter by the people does not amend or rescind any consistent provisions of the general plan, local coastal program or zoning ordinances, but does strengthen and define such consistent provisions. (Ord. 632 § 1, 1987)

17.93.060 Severability.
If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, or part of this chapter is held to be invalid, the remainder of the chapter shall be given full effect consistent with the intent and purpose of the chapter. (Ord. 632 § 1, 1987)

C. For new development the city shall maintain maximum setbacks from natural areas.

D. In limited circumstances, where a vacant parcel lacking structure-siting flexibility exists, a reduction of the standard setback may be permitted in order to allow for a minimum level of development, providing that it can be ensured that encroachment into the setback area will not have a significant effect on the natural area.

E. In order to provide technical expertise concerning specific habitat protection issues, the city shall require the services of a biologist, botanist, forester, or other qualified professional to assist in determining such questions as the precise location or boundary of a designated natural area, or the effect of the proposed development project on the immediate and long-term health and viability of the natural area. This may be required through the environmental impact review process. Mitigation measures as contained in the professional evaluations shall be made conditions of approval where needed to minimize impact.

F. If necessary and appropriate to protect natural areas, consideration should be given to requesting or requiring permanent conservation easements over portions of property containing designated natural areas. All environmentally sensitive habitat areas and their buffer zones shall be protected by conservation easements or deed restrictions. (Ord. 677 § 7(B), 1989; Ord. 634 § 1, 1987)

17.95.060 Soquel Creek – Escalona Gulch Monarch butterfly habitat regulations.
In the habitat described in subsection A, the requirements of subsections B and following must be met:

A. Habitat Description. The Soquel Creek grove is located east of the intersection of Wharf Road and Clares Street, on the west side of the creek. The wintering site is part of the former Rispin Mansion property. Monterey pines, redwoods, and acacia are interspersed within the grove.

Escalona Gulch is located between the Southern Pacific railroad tracks and the ocean and is bounded on the immediate west side by a residential area and El Salto Resort. To the east is a residential area. The gulch is a steep sided, deeply incised ravine with a small intermittent stream. A dense stand of eucalyptus trees with some Monterey pines and Monterey cypress completely fills the gulch. There is little native vegetation except for poison oak. The understory is overgrown with nonnative vines.

B. Development in areas adjacent to the butterfly groves shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade the areas.

C. The applicant shall be required to retain a qualified professional to determine the location of the outer edge of the Monarch habitat and to report to the city potential impacts and mitigation measures for proposed development.

D. Removal of trees within the perimeter of the habitat areas shall be prohibited unless it is determined by the community development director that such removal is necessary by reason of good forestry practice, disease of the tree, or safety considerations. Any such determinations, including tree maintenance or trimming, shall be accompanied by a written evaluation of the impacts of the proposed action on habitat resources by a qualified expert on the Monarch butterfly. Such report and investigations shall be arranged by the city and paid for by the applicant as part of environmental review.

E. Construction within or on properties contiguous to the designated butterfly groves shall be prohibited during fall and winter months when the Monarch butterflies are present. Removal or modification of trees within the groves shall not be permitted during these periods except when determined by the community development director to be a necessary emergency to protect human life or property.

F. Coastal development permit applications within or adjacent to the Soquel Creek-Escalona Gulch Monarch butterfly habitats shall contain landscaping plans which set forth the location and extent of any proposed modifications to existing vegetation and the locations, kinds, and extent of new landscaping. The emphasis of such landscaping plans shall be on the maintenance and enhancement of the butterfly habitats.

G. Conformance to the Capitola erosion control ordinance shall be required. Grading shall be minimized within the riparian setback area. Grading shall not be permitted to damage the roots of trees within the butterfly habitat areas. Grading shall only take place during the dry season. (Ord. 677 § 7(F), 1989; Ord. 634 § 1, 1987)

17.95.061 Escalona Gulch Monarch Butterfly Habitat – Additional regulations.
The following are additional regulations regarding the Escalona Gulch Monarch Butterfly Habitat:

On the Escalona Gulch properties (APNs 26-141-13 through 18) development shall be confined to Lots 2, 3 and 4 shown on Exhibit “A” attached to the ordinance codified in this section and found on file in the office of the city clerk (derived from Figure 3 of EIR for Residential Development on Robert Blodgett Property, March 1991).

To provide for the least environmentally damaging alternative, future construction of buildings, driveways and Escalona Drive shall minimize removal of trees and site coverage. Total building square footage shall be limited to six thousand square feet and building coverage shall not have a total footprint of more than four thousand square feet. The building(s) shall be located and designed so that they do not have a significant adverse impact on the Monarch butterfly habitat. The habitat, and area around it necessary to preserve the habitat, shall be placed in a conservation easement at the time of development.

Up to an additional six hundred square feet of footprint for driveway only may be allowed if a redesigned site plan, e.g., fewer buildings, relocated building(s) (including the six hundred square feet of driveway coverage), results in reduced impacts to the monarch grove habitat.

Prohibit development and removal of trees, understory and other vegetation on all lands outside the identified roadway and building envelopes through use of a conservation easement(s). The easement should be held by a government agency or organization authorized to monitor and enforce easement restrictions. Other trees and ground vegetation adjacent to the building envelopes shall not be trimmed or altered in any way unless reviewed by a qualified arborist and Monarch butterfly expert and approved by the city community development director.

Trees and vegetation within the Escalona Drive right-of-way, but outside any planned paved area, should be retained in their existing condition.

Building pads and driveways shall be designed to avoid removal of large trees. Large trees to be protected immediately adjacent to buildings should be evaluated by an arborist to assure that they will not pose a hazard in the future. Trees which are seriously diseased or hazardous should be trimmed or removed during the building process, rather than having to disturb the habitat during some future winter season when falling limbs are the most likely to occur. If removal is deemed necessary, replanting shall be implemented in conjunction with the site replanting program.

Implement a tree replanting program for replacement of trees removed for construction developed in consultation with a qualified monarch butterfly expert and the California Department of Fish and Game. The trees shall be sited in strategic locations as identified by the replanting program.

Limit landscaping at future homesites to areas within identified building envelopes. Shrubs which flower in the early fall and could provide a good source of flower nectar for the butterflies should be planted based on a list of landscape suggestions written by a qualified Monarch butterfly biologist. Such a list shall be made available to homeowners.

Due to lack of a quantified data base and some disagreement among butterfly specialists, microclimatic measurements shall be taken before and after construction to help develop a data base regarding environmental parameters associated with butterfly behavior. Such monitoring shall be funded by the applicant and be conducted by a qualified Monarch butterfly expert. Monitoring shall include measurements of wind direction and velocity, temperature and humidity profiles and light intensity. Monitoring shall be conducted for three years after final construction on the property. Measurements of height, diameter, and age of cluster trees shall be taken the first year.

Utilize barrier fencing around large trees, especially cluster trees, for protection during construction.

Limit structure heights as needed to prevent shading of cluster sites.

Prohibit wood-burning fireplaces in structures built on site where Monarch butterflies may be disturbed due to chimney smoke.

No construction involving heavy equipment that might bump into the cluster trees or produce heavy plumes of exhaust smoke should take place during the months in which the Monarchs are in residence (October 1st to March 1st).

Prepare and implement a drainage and erosion control plan which incorporates drainage devices (e.g., subsurface pipes, energy dissipators) to prevent long-term erosion of side slopes leading to Escalona Gulch, as well as erosion control during construction. Erosion control measures should include limiting removal of vegetation, minimizing exposure of bare soils, replanting disturbed soils with suitable native species, controlling runoff, preventing sedimentation from entering drainages, and limiting construction to dry season. All areas outside immediate construction areas should not be disturbed. Require measures for temporary drainage retention during construction, mulching, erosion control seeding, and other measures as needed to prevent any sediment from reaching Escalona Gulch.

2. Unreasonably discriminate among wireless communications providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services;

3. Regulate the installation, operation, collocation, modification, or removal of wireless facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF) emissions to the extent that such emissions comply with all applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations;

4. Prohibit or effectively prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under state or federal law; or

5. Preempt any applicable state or federal law. (Ord. 1012 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 1009 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 862 § 1, 2003)

17.98.020 Definitions. Revised 1/18
A. Terms Defined. Terms used in this chapter are defined as follows:

1. “Amateur radio facilities” are antennas and related equipment for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication, or technical investigations carried out by an amateur radio operator who operates without commercial interest, and who holds a written authorization from the Federal Communications Commission to operate an amateur radio facility.

2. “Antenna” means a device or system of wires, poles, rods, dishes, discs, or similar devices used to transmit and/or receive radio or electromagnetic waves.

3. “Applicable FCC decisions” means the same as defined by California Government Code Section 65964.1(d)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as “In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994 (2009) and In the Matter of Acceleration of Broadband Deployment by Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd. 12865 (2014).”

4. “Array” means one or more antennas mounted at approximately the same level above ground on tower or base station.

5. “Base station” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as follows:

a. A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower.

b. “Base station” includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

c. “Base station” includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks).

d. “Base station” includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001, supports or houses equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (ii) of 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001 that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support.

e. “Base station” excludes any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001, does not support or house equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (ii) of 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001.

6. “Collocation” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as “[t]he mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes.” As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition effectively means “to add” new equipment to an existing facility and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site.

7. “Eligible facilities request” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as “[a]ny request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (i) Collocation of new transmission equipment; (ii) Removal of transmission equipment; or (iii) Replacement of transmission equipment.”

8. “Eligible support structure” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)4), as may be amended, which defines that term as “[a]ny tower or base station as defined in [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001], provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001].”

9. “Existing” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(5), as may be amended, which provides that “[a] constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the [FCC rules implementing Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act] if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.”

10. “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission or its successor agency.

11. “Personal wireless services” has the same meaning as provided in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as “commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services.”

12. “Section 6409(a)” means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as may be amended.

13. “Service provider” means a wireless communications provider, company or organization, or the agent of a company or organization that provides wireless communications services.

14. “Significant gap” is a gap in the service provider’s own wireless telecommunications facilities, as defined in federal case law interpretations of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.

15. “Site” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that “[f]or towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.”

16. “Stealth facility” is any facility designed to blend into the surrounding environment, and is visually unobtrusive. Examples of stealth facilities may include architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, facade-mounted antennas painted and treated as architectural elements to blend with the existing building, or elements designed to appear as vegetation or trees. Also referred to as concealed communications facilities.

17. “Substantial change” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location. For clarity, the definition in this chapter organizes and paraphrases the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location. The definition of substantial change contained in this section shall be interpreted and applied so as to be consistent with 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended) and the applicable FCC decisions, rules and orders and court rulings relating to the same. In the event of any conflict between the definition of substantial change contained in this section and the definition contained in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended), 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended) shall govern and control.

a. For towers outside the public right-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:

i. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or

iii. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or

iv. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

b. For towers in the public right-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

i. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet; or

iii. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or

iv. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure; or

v. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any ground cabinets that are more than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; or

vi. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

c. In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

i. The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the community development director; or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided, however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets, or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

d. Interpretation of Thresholds.

i. The thresholds for a substantial change described above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur.

ii. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

18. “Temporary wireless communications facility” means a wireless communications facility located on a parcel of land and consisting of a vehicle-mounted facility, a building-mounted antenna, or a similar facility, and associated equipment, that is used to provide temporary coverage for a large-scale event or an emergency, or to provide temporary replacement coverage due to the removal of an existing permitted, permanent wireless communications facility necessitated by the demolition or major alteration of a nearby property.

19. “Tower” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as “[a]ny structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any [FCC]-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site.” Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees, and lattice towers.

20. “Transmission equipment” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 140001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as “[e]quipment that facilitates transmission for any [FCC]-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.”

21. “Wireless” means any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications service transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.

22. “Wireless communications facility” is a facility that sends and/or receives radio frequency signals, AM/FM, microwave, and/or electromagnetic waves for the purpose of providing voice, data, images or other information, including, but not limited to, cellular and/or digital telephone service, personal communications services, and paging services. Wireless communications facilities include antennas and all other types of equipment for the transmission or receipt of such signals; towers or similar structures built to support such equipment; equipment cabinets, base stations, and other accessory development; and screening and concealment elements. (Also referred to as “facility.”)

23. “Wireless communications provider” is any company or organization that provides or who represents a company or organization that provides wireless communications services. (Also referred to as “service provider.”)

24. “Zoning code” means the city of Capitola zoning code.

iv. If located (or proposed to be located) in the city’s coastal zone, does not impact public views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas.

c. The review authority may approve a height exception for towers or utility poles when:

i. The proposed facility is no taller than the minimum necessary to meet service objectives;

ii. The height exception is necessary to address a significant gap in the applicant’s existing service coverage;

iii. The applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning commission, through a detailed alternatives analysis, that there are no viable, technically feasible, and environmentally (e.g., visually) equivalent or superior potential alternatives (i.e., sites, facility types, siting techniques, and/or designs) that comply with the height standard and meet service objectives; and

iv. The proposed facility complies with design standards and preferences in subsection B of this section (Tower-Mounted Facilities) to the maximum extent feasible.

4. Setbacks. All facilities shall comply with all setback requirements in the applicable zoning district.

5. Collocation. Facilities shall be designed, installed, and maintained to accommodate future collocated facilities to the extent feasible.

17.99.010 Definitions.
“Secondary dwelling unit” means a self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from, and in addition to, the primary residential unit on a single lot. A secondary unit will be considered as attached to the primary residential unit for the purposes of this chapter when the secondary dwelling unit shares at least one common wall with the primary residential unit. All other secondary dwelling units for purposes of this chapter will be considered detached. (Ord. 886 § 1, 2005; Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.020 Purpose.
The purpose of secondary dwelling units is to allow for an increase in the supply of affordable housing, in conformance with the goals and policies of the housing element of the city of Capitola general plan, while maintaining the single-family character of the neighborhoods of the city. (Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.030 Locations permitted.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, secondary dwelling units shall be allowed in the single-family residence district (R-1). (Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.040 Permit procedures.
Any attached or one-story detached secondary dwelling unit meeting the same development standards as permitted for the primary residence in the zoning district and meeting the design standards in Section 17.99.060, or any single-story secondary dwelling unit that meets the design standards in Section 17.99.060, shall require administrative review for compliance with Section 17.99.060 from the community development department and a building permit.

Any secondary dwelling unit not meeting the requirements above shall be subject to: (1) an architecture and site review permit with a public hearing before the planning commission, (2) the findings as described in Section 17.99.050, and (3) the development standards as described in Section 17.99.060. (Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.050 Findings required for architecture and site review permitted secondary dwelling units.
Before approval or modified approval of an application for a secondary dwelling unit requiring a conditional use permit, the decision making body shall find that:

A. Exterior design of the secondary dwelling unit is compatible with the existing residence on the lot through architectural use of building forms, height, construction materials, colors, landscaping, and other methods that conform to acceptable construction practices;

B. The exterior design is in harmony with, and maintains the scale of, the neighborhood;

C. The secondary dwelling unit does not result in excessive noise, traffic or parking congestion;

D. The property fronts on an adequate water main and sewer line each with the capacity to serve the additional secondary dwelling unit;

E. The site plan provides adequate open space and landscaping that is useful for both the secondary dwelling unit and the primary residence. Open space and landscaping provides for privacy and screening of adjacent properties;

F. The location and design of the secondary dwelling unit maintains a compatible relationship to adjacent properties and does not significantly impact the privacy, light, air, solar access or parking of adjacent properties;

G. The secondary dwelling unit generally limits the major access stairs, decks, entry doors, and major windows to the walls facing the primary residence, or to the alley if applicable. Windows that impact the privacy of the neighboring side or rear yard have been minimized. The design of the secondary dwelling unit shall relate to the design of the primary residence and shall not visually dominate it or the surrounding properties;

H. The site plan shall be consistent with physical development policies of the general plan, any required or optional element of the general plan, and any area plan or specific plan or other city policy for physical development. If located in the coastal zone, a site plan shall also be consistent with policies of the local coastal plan;

I. The orientation and location of buildings, structures, open spaces and other features of the site plan are such that they maintain natural resources including significant trees and shrubs to the extent feasible and minimize alteration of natural land forms;

J. The site plan is situated and designed to protect views along the ocean and of scenic coastal areas. Where appropriate and feasible, the site plan restores and enhances the visual quality of visually degraded areas. (Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.060 Design and development standards.
All secondary dwelling units must conform to the following design and development standards:

1. Parking. Parking requirements shall meet the underlying zoning requirement for the combined square footage of habitable space of the subject property.

2. Unit Size. The floor area for secondary dwelling units shall not exceed five hundred square feet for lots between five thousand and seven thousand five hundred square feet. If a lot exceeds seven thousand five hundred square feet, a secondary dwelling unit may be up to six hundred forty square feet and, for lots in excess of ten thousand square feet, a secondary dwelling unit may be up to eight hundred square feet. In no case may any combination of habitable buildings occupy more than sixty percent floor area ratio (FAR) of the subject property. No secondary dwelling units shall be allowed on lot sizes less than five thousand square feet.

3. Existing Development on Lot. A single-family dwelling shall exist on the lot or shall be constructed in conjunction with the secondary dwelling unit.

4. Number of Secondary Dwelling Units Per Parcel. Only one secondary dwelling unit shall be allowed for each parcel.

5. Setbacks for Detached Secondary Dwelling Units. A minimum five-foot side-yard setback and minimum eight-foot rearyard setback are required for detached single-story structures containing a secondary dwelling unit. Detached secondary dwelling units shall be no higher than one story. If any portion of a secondary dwelling unit is located in front of the main building, then the front and side yard setbacks shall be the same as a main building in the zoning district. The entrance to the detached secondary dwelling unit shall face the interior of the lot unless the secondary dwelling unit is directly accessible from an alley or a public street. Openings (e.g., doors and windows) on exterior walls that are closest to and face adjacent residentially-zoned properties shall be designed to ensure that privacy and access to light and ventilation is not diminished on adjacent properties.

6. Setbacks for Attached Secondary Dwelling Units. Attached secondary dwelling units shall meet the same setbacks as a main building in the zoning district.

7. Other Code Requirements. The secondary dwelling unit shall meet the requirements of the Uniform Building Code.

8. Occupancy. The property owner must occupy either the primary or secondary dwelling.

9. Building Height and Stories.

b. If the design of the main dwelling has special roof features that match the detached secondary dwelling unit, the maximum building height of the secondary dwelling unit may be exceeded to include such similar special roof features subject to review by the architecture and site review committee and approval of the planning commission.

10. Alley Orientation. When a secondary dwelling unit is adjacent to an alley, every effort shall be made to orient the secondary dwelling unit toward the alley with the front access door and windows facing the alley. Parking provided off the alley shall maintain a twenty-four foot back-out area, which may include the alley. Fences shall be three feet six inches along the alley. However, higher fencing up to six feet can be considered in unusual privacy, security or design circumstances subject to review and approval of the planning commission.

11. Design. The design of the secondary dwelling unit shall relate to the design of the primary residence by use of the similar exterior wall materials, window types, door and window trims, roofing materials and roof pitch.

12. Open Space and Landscaping. The site plan provides open space and landscaping that is useful for both the secondary dwelling unit and the primary residence. Landscaping shall be provided which provides for the privacy and screening of adjacent properties.

13. Mobile Units. Vehicles of any kind, with or without wheels, and trailers are prohibited as secondary dwelling units. (Ord. 860 § 1, 2003; Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.070 Deed restrictions.
Before obtaining a building permit for a secondary dwelling unit, the property owner shall file with the county recorder a declaration of restrictions containing a reference to the deed under which the property was acquired by the present owner and stating that:

A. The secondary dwelling unit shall not be sold separately;

B. The unit is restricted to the approved size;

C. The administrative review or the architecture and site review permit, whichever applies, for the secondary dwelling unit shall be in effect only so long as the owner of record occupies either the main residence or the secondary dwelling unit;

D. The above declarations are binding upon any successor in ownership of the property. Lack of compliance shall be cause for code enforcement and/or revoking the administrative review or the architecture and site review permit, whichever applies;

E. The deed restrictions shall lapse upon removal of the secondary dwelling unit. (Ord. 858 § 1, 2003)

17.99.080 Zoning incentives.
The following incentives are to encourage construction of secondary dwelling units:

A. Affordability Requirements for Fee Waivers. Secondary dwelling units proposed to be rented at low or very low income levels, as established by the city, may have development fees waived per the city’s fee schedule (Resolution No. 3183, adopted 12/13/01, as amended). Landlords of secondary dwelling units shall be relieved of the affordability condition upon payment of fees in the amount previously waived as a result of affordability requirements, subject to an annual CPI increase commencing with the date of application for building permit. Applicants of affordable secondary dwelling units must record a deed restriction limiting the rent to low or very low-income levels prior to issuance of a building permit.

B. Historic Properties. Secondary dwelling units proposed on proprieties that contain local, state, or federal historic building(s) or potentially historic building(s), as identified by a professional architectural historian approved by the city, may be entitled to certain waivers with respect to setbacks, parking, height, unit size, and other design features as deemed appropriate by the planning commission, for the purposes of preserving the architectural character of the primary residence.

17.04.010 Title and authority. Revised 6/18
Title 17 of the Capitola Municipal Code shall be known and cited as the “Capitola Zoning Code” and referred to in this title as “the zoning code.” The zoning code is adopted pursuant to the authority in Section 65850 of the California Government Code. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.04.020 Purpose of the zoning code. Revised 6/18
A. General. The purpose of the zoning code is to implement the general plan and the local coastal program land use plan (LUP) and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

B. Specific. The zoning code is intended to:

1. Preserve and enhance Capitola’s small-town feel and coastal village charm.

2. Ensure that all development exhibits high quality design that supports a unique sense of place.

3. Protect and enhance the quality of life in residential neighborhoods.

4. Encourage active and inviting commercial and mixed use areas.

5. Support a vibrant, diverse, and dynamic local economy.

6. Allow for a broad range of housing choices that meets the needs of all segments of the community.

7. Protect and enhance natural resources that contribute to Capitola’s unique identity and scenic beauty.

17.04.030 Relationship to the general plan. Revised 6/18
The zoning code implements the general plan by regulating the use of land and structures in Capitola. If the zoning code conflicts with the general plan, the general plan governs. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.04.040 Relationship to the local coastal program. Revised 6/18
A. General. The zoning code is a component of Capitola’s local coastal program (LCP) prepared in accordance with the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The LCP consists of the local coastal program land use plan (LUP) and the local coastal program implementation plan (IP). The LCP applies to areas within the coastal zone as identified on the city of Capitola zoning map and within the LCP.

B. Local Coastal Program Implementation Plan.

1. The local coastal program IP establishes specific land use and development regulations to implement the local coastal program LUP. The following zoning code chapters are a part of Capitola’s local coastal program IP:

a. All chapters in Part 2 (Zoning Districts and Overlay Zones).

b. All chapters in Part 3 (Citywide Standards).

c. Chapter 17.160 (Glossary).

2. Any portion of the zoning code not specifically identified in subsection (B)(1) of this section is hereby declared to not be a component of Capitola’s local coastal program IP.

C. Conflicting Provisions. If the local coastal program implementation plan conflicts with the local coastal program land use plan, the local coastal program land use plan shall govern. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.04.050 Applicability of the zoning code. Revised 6/18
A. Applicability to Property. The zoning code applies to all land, uses, and structures within the Capitola city limits.

B. Compliance with Regulations. All uses, structures, and development activity in Capitola shall comply with the zoning code.

C. Conflicting Regulations. Where conflict occurs with other city regulations or with state or federal laws, higher law shall control over lower law unless local variation is permitted. Where conflicting laws are of equal stature, the more restrictive shall control unless otherwise specified in the zoning code or in state or federal law. In the coastal zone, in case of conflict between the local coastal program and any other city law, regulation, or policy, the local coastal program shall prevail. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.08.010 Purpose. Revised 6/18
This chapter establishes rules and procedures for interpreting the zoning code to ensure that it is applied and enforced in a consistent manner. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.08.020 Authority. Revised 6/18
The city council delegates to the community development director and the director’s designees authority in accordance with Section 17.08.040 to interpret the meaning and applicability of all provisions in the zoning code. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.08.030 Rules of interpretation. Revised 6/18
A. General Rules. Rules of interpretation in Chapter 1.04 (General Provisions) apply to the zoning code. The following general rules also apply to the interpretation and application of the zoning code:

1. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this zoning code, the most restrictive requirement shall control.

2. Where there is a conflict between text and any figure, illustration, graphic, heading, map, table, or caption, the text governs.

3. The words “shall,” “will,” “is to,” and “are to” are mandatory. “Should” means a regulation that is not mandatory, but must be either fulfilled or the applicant must demonstrate an alternative that fulfills the intent of the regulation or that a noneconomic hardship makes compliance infeasible. “May” is permissive.

4. The following conjunctions are interpreted as follows:

a. “And” means that all items or provisions so connected apply.

b. “Or” means that all items or provisions so connected apply singularly or in any combination.

c. “Either ... or” means that one of the items or provisions so connected apply singularly, but not in combination.

5. All officials, bodies, agencies, ordinances, policies, and regulations referred to in the zoning code are those of Capitola unless otherwise noted.

B. Calendar Days. Numbers of days specified in the zoning code are continuous calendar days unless otherwise noted. Where the last of a number of days falls on a holiday or weekend (Saturday or Sunday), time limits are extended to the following working day.

C. Land Use Regulation Tables.

1. Table Notation. Land use regulation tables in Part 2 (Zoning Districts and Overlay Zones) establish permitted land uses within each zoning district. Notations within these tables have the following meanings:

a. Permitted Uses. A “P” means that a use is permitted by right in the zoning district and is not subject to discretionary review and approval.

b. Administrative Permit. An “A” means the use is permitted with the approval of an administrative permit.

c. Minor Use Permit. An “M” means that a use requires approval of a minor use permit.

d. Conditionally Permitted Uses. A “C” means that a use requires approval of a conditional use permit.

e. Uses Not Allowed. A “–” means that a use is not allowed in the zoning district.

2. Additional Permits. Notwithstanding subsection (C)(1) of this section, additional permits may be required beyond those identified in the land use regulation tables, including but not limited to design permits, coastal permits, and historic alteration permits.

D. Unlisted Land Uses. If a proposed land use is not listed in the zoning code, the use is not permitted except as follows:

1. An unlisted use is not permitted if the use is listed as a permitted use in one or more other zoning districts. In such a case, the absence of the use in the zoning district within the land use table means that the use is prohibited in the zoning district.

2. The community development director may determine that an unlisted proposed use is equivalent to a permitted or conditionally permitted use if all of the following findings can be made:

a. The use is similar to other uses allowed in the zoning district.

b. The density or intensity of the use is similar to other uses in the zoning district.

c. The use is compatible with permitted or conditionally permitted uses in the zoning district.

d. The use will meet the purpose of the zoning district.

e. The use is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan and the local coastal program land use plan.

f. The use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.

3. When the community development director determines that a proposed use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use shall be treated in the same manner as the listed use with respect to development standards, permits required, and all applicable requirements of the zoning code.

E. Zoning Map Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules apply:

1. Boundaries shown as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys are construed to follow the centerlines.

2. Boundaries shown as approximately following platted lot lines are construed as following the lot lines.

3. Boundaries shown as approximately following city limits are construed as following city limits.

4. Boundaries shown following railroad lines are construed to be midway between the main tracks.

5. In unsubdivided property or where a zoning district boundary divides a parcel, the location of the boundary is determined by the use of the scale appearing on the zoning map.

6. In case further uncertainty exists, the community development director shall determine the exact location of the boundaries. The director’s decision may be appealed to the planning commission to determine the exact location of the boundaries.

F. Parcels Containing Two or More Zoning Districts.

1. For parcels containing two or more zoning districts (“split zoning”), the location of the zoning district boundary shall be determined by the community development director. The director’s decision may be appealed to the planning commission to determine the exact location of the boundaries.

2. For parcels containing two or more zoning districts, the regulations for each zoning district shall apply within the zoning district boundaries as identified on the zoning map. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.08.040 Procedures for interpretation/determinations. Revised 6/18
A. Request for Interpretation. The community development director shall respond in writing to written requests for interpretation of the zoning code if the requested interpretation would substantially clarify an ambiguity which interferes with the effective administration of the zoning code. The following procedures apply for a request for interpretation:

1. The request shall be in writing, shall identify the provision to be interpreted, and shall be accompanied by the fee identified in the latest fee schedule.

2. The request shall provide any information that the director requires to assist in its review.

3. The director shall respond to an interpretation request within thirty days of receiving the request.

B. Form and Content of Interpretation. Official interpretations prepared by the director shall be in writing, and shall quote the zoning code provisions being interpreted. The interpretation shall describe the circumstance that caused the need for the interpretation.

C. Official Record of Interpretations. An official record of interpretations shall be kept and updated regularly by the community development department. The record of interpretations shall be indexed by the number of the section that is the subject of the interpretation and made available for public inspection during normal business hours.

D. Referral to Planning Commission. The director may refer any request for interpretation of the zoning code to the planning commission for review and interpretation.

E. Appeals. Any official interpretation prepared by the director may be appealed to the planning commission. The planning commission’s interpretation may be appealed to the city council. Appeals shall be accompanied by the fee identified in the latest fee schedule.

F. Coastal Interpretations. An applicant may submit to the director a request for interpretation on coastal matters from the Coastal Commission Executive Director for the director to consider when making an official interpretation of the zoning code. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.08.050 Zoning code enforcement. Revised 6/18
Enforcement of the zoning code shall occur in a manner consistent with Title 4 (General Municipal Code Enforcement). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.16.010 Purpose of the residential zoning districts. Revised 6/18
A. General. The purpose of residential zoning districts is to support attractive, safe, and friendly neighborhoods consistent with Capitola’s intimate small-town feel and coastal village charm. Development within the residential zoning districts will feature high quality design that enhances the visual character of the community. The mass, scale, and design of new homes shall be compatible with existing homes in neighborhoods and carefully designed to minimize impacts to existing homes. Residential zoning districts contain a range of housing types and community facilities to support diverse and complete neighborhoods with a high quality of life for residents.

B. Specific.

1. Residential Single-Family (R-1) Zoning District. The purpose of the R-1 zoning district is to protect and enhance the unique qualities of individual neighborhoods in Capitola. The R-1 zoning district allows for variation in development standards based on the existing development patterns within these neighborhoods. New development will respect the existing scale, density, and character of neighborhoods to strengthen Capitola’s unique sense of place.

2. Residential Multifamily (RM) Zoning District. The purpose of the RM zoning district is to accommodate a range of housing types to serve all Capitola residents. The RM zoning districts allow single-family and multifamily housing at higher densities to maintain and increase the supply of affordable housing choices. Housing in the RM zoning districts will be carefully designed to enhance Capitola’s unique identity and to minimize impacts on adjacent land uses and structures. The RM zone is divided into three subzones (RM-L, RM-M, and RM-H) allowing for a range of permitted residential densities.

3. Mobile Home Park (MH) Zoning District. The MH zone provides areas for exclusive development of mobile home parks. Mobile home parks provide a valuable source of affordable housing serving Capitola’s lower income and senior residents. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.20.010 Purpose of the mixed use zoning districts. Revised 6/18
A. General. The purpose of the mixed use zoning districts is to provide for active and inviting destinations in Capitola with a diversity of residential and commercial land uses. In the mixed use zoning districts, development shall support a lively, pedestrian-friendly public realm with inviting storefronts facing the sidewalk. A diversity of local and independent businesses, recreational amenities, and public spaces balance the needs of residents and visitors. New development shall respect Capitola’s history and reflect its unique coastal village character. The diversity of land uses, pedestrian-friendly development, and general level of activity in the mixed use zoning districts shall support a range of transportation choices, including walking, biking, and transit.

B. Specific.

1. Mixed Use, Village (MU-V) Zoning District. The purpose of the MU-V zoning district is to preserve and enhance Capitola Village as the heart of the community. A diversity of commercial, residential, and recreational uses in the MU-V zoning district serve both visitors and residents. Land uses and development shall enhance the vitality of the Village while maintaining a high quality of life for residents. A fine-grain mix of retail, restaurants, services, and recreational amenities in the MU-V zoning district provides a walkable environment, caters to all ages, and supports year-round activity during the day and night.

2. Mixed Use, Neighborhood (MU-N) Zoning District. The purpose of MU-N zoning district is to allow for neighborhood-serving mixed use areas that enhance residents’ quality of life. The MU-N zoning district contains an eclectic mix of retail, restaurants, and services for residents and visitors. A range of housing types close to nonresidential uses increases housing choices and supports a walkable community. Development in the MU-N zoning district will be carefully designed to complement its surroundings and minimize impacts on neighboring properties. Land uses will strengthen connections between destinations in Capitola, including the Village, Bay Avenue, and 41st Avenue. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

c. Loading areas shall be located to the side and rear of buildings, and shall be sufficiently screened from the public right-of-way, as determined by the community development director.

Figure 17.20-7: Parking Location

6. Driveways and Curb Cuts.

a. The maximum width of a new driveway crossing a public sidewalk may not exceed forty percent of the parcel width or twenty feet, whichever is less. The community development director may approve an exception to this standard in the case of shared or joint use of driveways and parking lots.

b. New curb cuts, where allowed, shall be located and designed to maximize safety and convenience for pedestrians, bicycles and mass transit vehicles, as determined by the community development director. Considerations for determination include separation between curb cuts, displaced parking, and sight lines.

A. Community Commercial (C-C) Zoning District. The purpose of the C-C zoning district is to provide areas for a variety of commercial uses serving Capitola residents and visitors. The C-C zoning district allows for retail, restaurants, and services that meet the daily needs of the community. The scale, intensity, and design of development in the C-C zoning district shall be compatible with adjacent neighborhoods and contribute to Capitola’s unique coastal village character. Interspersed residential and office uses in the C-C zoning district shall support a diverse local economy and range of housing choices.

B. Regional Commercial (C-R) Zoning District. The purpose of the C-R zoning district is to provide areas for commercial uses that serve regional shoppers as well as Capitola residents, workers, and visitors. The C-R zoning district will maintain a critical mass of retail and service uses that maintain 41st Avenue as a successful retail destination. Office, medical, and residential uses will be restricted to protect the long-term economic vitality of the corridor. Incremental redevelopment of underutilized properties in the C-R zoning district will enhance the corridor as a pedestrian-friendly shopping destination that enhance Capitola’s unique identity and quality of life.

C. Industrial (I) Zoning District. The purpose of the I zoning district is to provide an area for heavy commercial and light industrial uses in Capitola. The I zoning district allows for nonresidential uses which are desired in the community but could be incompatible with land uses in other zoning districts. The I zoning district shall continue to accommodate businesses that contribute to a diverse economy, provide local jobs, and serve the needs of residents and other businesses in Capitola.

B. CC Zoning District Fronting Capitola Road. The following requirements apply to C-C parcels fronting the south side of Capitola Road between 41st Avenue and 45th Avenue as shown in Figure 17.24-1:

1. Maximum height: thirty-five feet.

2. Minimum rear setback: forty feet.

3. Enhanced Application Review. A proposed project with a height greater than two stories shall comply with the following enhanced application review procedures:

a. Conceptual Review.

i. Prior to consideration of a formal application, the planning commission and city council shall provide conceptual review of a proposed project in accordance with Chapter 17.114 (Conceptual Review).

 Figure 17.24-1: Parcels Fronting Capitola Road between 41st Avenue and 45th Avenue

ii. Before planning commission and city council review, the applicant shall host at least one community workshop to solicit community input on preliminary project plans.

iii. When reviewed by the planning commission and city council, the applicant shall demonstrate how the project design addresses public input received at the community workshop, as appropriate.

b. City Council Action. Following conceptual review, the planning commission shall serve as the recommending body and the city council shall serve as the review authority and take final action on the application.

c. Findings. To approve the application, the city council shall make all of the following findings in addition to findings for the required permits:

i. The project satisfies applicable design review criteria in Section 17.120.070 (Design review criteria).

ii. On-site parking, points of ingress/egress, and internal vehicle accessways are located and designed to minimize parking and traffic impacts on neighboring residential areas to the greatest extent possible.

iii. The project incorporates rear yard setbacks and upper story stepbacks as needed to maintain adequate light and air for abutting residential uses.

iv. The height and intensity of development is compatible with the scale and character of neighboring residential areas.

v. The project incorporates design features to support a safe and welcoming pedestrian environment. Potential features may include, but are not limited to, enhanced sidewalks along the property frontage, internal pedestrian walkways, outdoor public gathering places, unique landscaping treatments, and active ground-floor uses fronting the street.

C. Front and Street Side Setbacks in the C-R and C-C Zoning Districts. In the C-R and C-C zoning districts, buildings shall be set back from the front and street side property line so that:

1. The building is at least fifteen feet from the curb or street edge; and

2. Building placement allows for a minimum ten-foot sidewalk along the property frontage. See Figure 17.24-2.

Figure 17.24-2: Front and Street Side Setbacks in the C-R and C-C Zoning Districts

D. Increased Floor Area and Height in C-C and C-R Zoning Districts. As provided in Chapter 17.88 (Incentives for Community Benefits), the city council may approve exceptions to height and floor area ratio (FAR) limits shown in Table 17.24-3 for proposed projects in the C-C and C-R zoning districts. These exceptions are intended to facilitate the redevelopment of underutilized properties along 41st Avenue consistent with the vision for the corridor described in the general plan.

E. Residential Transition Standards. Where a commercial or industrial zoning district abuts a residential zoning district, the following standards apply:

1. Setbacks. The minimum setback from the residential property line shall be fifteen feet for interior side yards and twenty feet for rear yards. For lots less than one hundred feet wide, the planning commission may allow a reduced side yard setback upon finding that potential impacts to adjacent residential properties have been adequately minimized through enhanced building and landscape design.

2. Daylight Plane. No structure shall extend above or beyond a daylight plane having a height of twenty-five feet at the setback from the residential property line and extending into the parcel at an angle of forty-five degrees. See Figure 17.24-3.

Figure 17.24-3: Residential Transitions – Daylight Plane

3. Landscaping. A landscaped planting area, extending a minimum of ten feet from the property line, shall be provided along all residential property lines. A tree screen shall be planted in this area with trees planted at a minimum interval of fifteen feet.

4. Loading. Loading and unloading shall be designed to have the least amount of impact on neighboring residential uses. When feasible, loading and unloading shall be provided from the commercial frontage rather than from areas adjacent to residential uses.

F. Capitola Mall Redevelopment. While the Capitola Mall site has been zoned regional commercial (C-R) as part of the zoning code update, it is expected that major redevelopment of the mall property may require a rezone, planned development, specific plan, development agreement, or similar process to tailor appropriate development standards for the redevelopment project. Where an application submitted pursuant to this section includes fewer than all parcels within the mall property, the applicant shall demonstrate that the development type and pattern and site design will be compatible and not unreasonably interfere with future redevelopment of the remaining parcels. For the purposes of this section, the mall property is defined as the area bound by 41st Avenue, Clares Street, and Capitola Road.

G. Landscaping. See Section 17.72.050(B) for nonresidential landscape requirements. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.24.040 Residential mixed use development in commercial zoning districts. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose and Applicability. This section establishes design standards for mixed use development with housing above ground-floor commercial uses in the community commercial (C-C) and regional commercial (C-R) zoning districts. These standards are intended to promote successful mixed use development that is pedestrian-friendly and contributes to the vitality of commercial districts in Capitola.

B. Standards.

1. Ground-Floor Uses. Ground-floor spaces fronting the primary street shall be occupied by retail, restaurant, and personal service uses that generate pedestrian activity.

2. Building Placement. Buildings shall be placed near the edge of the sidewalk. Increased setbacks are permitted if they enhance pedestrian experience and add visual interest.

3. Building Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented towards a public street with the primary entrance to the site or building directly accessible from an adjacent sidewalk. The planning commission may allow buildings and their primary entrances to be oriented toward a public space. The primary entrance to a building shall not be oriented towards surface parking.

4. Blank Walls. The length of an unarticulated/blank building wall shall not exceed ten feet. Architectural articulation should have similar pattern as other adjacent buildings to provide cohesive design in the neighborhood. Building articulation may be provided by:

a. Doors, windows, and other building openings;

b. Building projections or recesses, doorway and window trim, and other details that provide architectural articulation and design interest;

c. Varying wall planes, heights or contrasting materials and colors; and

d. Awnings, canopies, or arcades to reinforce the pedestrian scale and provide shade and cover from the elements.

5. Storefront Width. The width of a single building/storefront shall not exceed fifty feet. Larger buildings shall be broken down into a pedestrian-scale rhythm with individual storefront widths of twenty-five to fifty feet.

6. Ground-Floor Building Transparency. The ground-floor street-facing building walls of nonresidential uses shall provide transparent windows or doors with views into the building for a minimum of sixty-five percent of the building frontage located between two and one-half and seven feet above the sidewalk. See Figure 17.24-4. Windows or doors area shall be transparent to allow views into the building. Exceptions to this transparency requirement may be allowed if the planning commission finds that:

a. The proposed use has unique operational characteristics which preclude building openings, such as for a cinema or theater; or

b. Street-facing building walls will exhibit architectural relief and detail, and will be enhanced with landscaping in such a way as to create visual interest at the pedestrian level.

Figure 17.24-4: Storefront Transparency

7. Retail Depth. Ground-floor commercial space shall have a depth of at least forty-five feet or two-thirds of the parcel depth, whichever is less. Where possible, sixty-foot depths are encouraged to accommodate a wider range of tenants, especially food tenants. The planning commission may grant an exception to the minimum retail depth requirement if the minimum retail depth is infeasible due to unusual physical conditions on the parcel.

8. Ground Floor Height. Ground-floor commercial space shall have a minimum floor-to-floor height of fifteen feet. Where possible, eighteen-foot floor-to-floor heights are encouraged.

9. Parking Location. No more than ten percent of off-street retail parking may be provided along the side of retail as “teaser” parking. The remainder of the parking shall be behind the building or in underground/structured parking. See Figure 17.24-5.

10. Driveways and Curb Cuts. Pedestrian and vehicle conflicts shall be minimized by limiting the number of curb cuts to two per block and the width of curb cuts to twenty-four feet where feasible. To the extent possible, curb cuts shall be designed so pedestrian curb ramps are limited and pathways remain level as they cross the vehicle route.

17.40.010 Purpose. Revised 6/18
This chapter contains requirements for overlay zones that primarily apply to residential uses and residential areas. Overlay zones establish additional standards and regulations to specific areas, in addition to the requirements of the underlying base zoning district. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.40.020 Affordable housing (-AH) overlay zone. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose. The purpose of the affordable housing (-AH) overlay zone is to facilitate the provision of affordable housing units through the retention and rehabilitation of existing affordable units, or the construction of new affordable units. The -AH overlay zone is intended to:

1. Implement the goals and policies of the general plan housing element and provide the opportunity and means for Capitola to meet its regional fair share allotment of affordable units.

2. Encourage the development of affordable units by assisting both the public and private sector in making the provision of these units economically viable.

3. Provide assurances to the city that these units will maintain a high degree of quality and will remain affordable to the target population over a reasonable duration of time.

4. Encourage the provision of affordable housing through the combination of the -AH overlay within the multifamily residential zone where the affordable housing projects are determined to be feasible and are consistent with the general plan.

5. Provide a means of directing and simplifying the process for creating and maintaining affordable housing.

6. Provide incentives to developers, whether in new or rehabilitated housing, to maintain rental units for the long term (e.g., not less than fifty-five years) and affordable ownership units in perpetuity.

B. Applicability. The -AH overlay zone may be applied to parcels located in a multifamily residential or community commercial (C-C) zoning district.

C. Definitions.

1. “Affordable housing” means housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with “very low,” “low,” or “moderate” income levels at an “affordable housing cost” or “affordable rent,” as those terms are defined by the state of California.

2. “Affordable housing overlay district” means a zoning district that applies in addition to existing zoning designation where the city encourages the provision of affordable housing units as described in this chapter.

3. The “very low,” “low,” and “moderate” income levels are defined by the state of California in Sections 50105, 50079.5, and 50093, respectively, of the California Health and Safety Code, and in Subchapter 2 of Chapter 6.5 of Division 1 of Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 6900. These income levels are:

a. Very Low Income. Up to and including fifty percent of the Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by the state law;

b. Lower Income. Fifty-one percent to eighty percent of Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by the state law;

c. Moderate Income. Eighty-one percent to one hundred twenty percent of Santa Cruz County median income, adjusted for family size, as defined by state law.

4. “Affordable housing cost” and “affordable rent” are defined in Sections 50052.5 and 50053, respectively, of the California Health and Safety Code, and in Subchapter 2 of Chapter 6.5 of Division 1 of Title 25 of the California Code of Regulations, commencing with Section 6900.

D. Relationship with State Density Bonus Law and Other State Laws.

1. All of the state laws and regulations referenced above, or their successors in defined terms when amended, shall be incorporated herein as though fully set forth. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the income and affordability levels set forth in this chapter and the levels set in state laws and regulations, the state provisions shall control.

2. The -AH overlay zone provides a density increase for affordable housing development that in most cases exceeds density bonuses permitted by state law (Government Code Section 65915).

3. A development may utilize the -AH overlay zone as an alternative to the use of state density bonus but may not utilize both the overlay and state density bonuses.

E. Permits and Approvals Required.

1. Affordable housing developments proposed under this chapter require the execution of a development agreement by the city and the developer. The development agreement shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 65864 et seq.

2. Affordable housing developments proposed under this chapter require approval of a design permit. All requirements in Chapter 17.120 (Design Permits) apply, except that the planning commission recommends design permit approval or denial to the city council. The city council may take action on the design permit application concurrently with or subsequent to action on the development agreement.

F. Permitted Residential Density.

1.     Affordable housing developments with up to twenty units per acre are permitted in the -AH overlay zone. The twenty units per acre limit is based on a calculation that includes all existing and new units on the property.

2. Density permitted in the -AH overlay zone may not exceed what can be accommodated by the site while meeting applicable parking, unit size, and other development standards.

3. Affordable housing development in the coastal zone may require a coastal permit in accordance with Chapter 17.44 (Coastal Overlay Zone).

G. Income Restrictions.

1. A minimum of fifty percent of the units in an affordable housing development shall be income restricted affordable housing. All affordable units may be in a single category or part of a mixture of affordable unit types which include:

a. Moderate income households;

b. Low income households;

c. Very low income households; or

d. Extremely low income households.

2. At minimum fifty percent of income-restricted affordable units (twenty-five percent of the total project units) shall be affordable to low, very low, and extremely low income households. A greater level of affordability will not allow a greater level of density.

H. Development Incentives.

1. Purpose.

a. In order to reduce costs associated with the development and construction of affordable housing, affordable housing developments within the -AH overlay zone shall be eligible for specified development incentives. These incentives allow for the relaxation of development standards normally applied to housing in Capitola and are established in order to facilitate and promote the development of affordable housing in the city.

b. Incentives shall be targeted to improve the project design or to yield the greatest number of affordable units and required level of affordability, so as to permit the city to meet its regional fair share allotment of affordable housing and the goals of the housing element of the general plan.

2. Relaxed Development Standards. The city shall allow the following relaxed development standards for projects that comply with the affordability required in subsection G of this section (Income Restrictions):

a. Minimum Building Site Area and Lot Area per Unit. There shall be no minimum building site area requirement for individual parcels or dwelling sites within the -AH overlay zone. The building site area shall be designated on a site plan as approved by the city through the design permit review process.

b. Density Averaging. Project density within the -AH overlay zone may be calculated by averaging the density on a project-wide basis so as to permit higher density levels in certain project portions in exchange for advantageous project design features as determined by the city through the design permit review process.

c. Setbacks.

i. The minimum setbacks from property lines shall be determined by the city through the design permit process.

ii. Minimum setbacks from property lines adjacent to or across from a single-family residential zone shall be same as underlying zoning district.

d. Building Coverage. The city shall determine the maximum building coverage for the proposed project through the design permit process.

3. Additional Development Incentives.

a. As a further inducement to the development of affordable housing beyond the relaxed development standards described in subsection (H)(2) of this section (Relaxed Development Standards), the city may choose to extend one or more additional development incentives depending on the quality, size, nature, and scope of the project being proposed.

b. Additional development incentives may be in the form of waivers or modifications of other standards which would otherwise inhibit density and achievement of affordable housing goals for the development site, including, but not limited to, the placement of public works improvements.

I. Design Standards.

1. Purpose and Applicability.

a. The following design standards are intended to ensure high quality development within the -AH overlay zone that enhances the visual qualities of Capitola and respects adjacent homes and neighborhoods.

b. Design standards shall apply to all projects receiving development incentives described in subsection H of this section (Development Incentives) or residential densities greater than allowed by the applicable base zone.

2. Neighborhood Compatibility.

a. Affordable housing developments shall be designed and developed in a manner compatible with and complementary to existing and potential development in the immediate vicinity of the project site.

b. Site planning on the perimeter shall provide for protection of the property from adverse surrounding influences and shall protect surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences from the property.

c. To the greatest extent possible, the design of the development shall promote privacy for residents and neighbors, security, and use of passive solar heating and cooling through proper placement of walls, windows, and landscaping.

d. Building design and materials shall blend with the neighborhood or existing structures on the site.

3. Building Height. Maximum building height shall be the same as in the underlying base zoning district.

4. Common Open Space.

a. Common open space shall comprise the greater of:

i. Ten percent of the total area of the site; or

ii. Seventy-five square feet for each dwelling unit.

b. Areas occupied by buildings, streets, driveways, parking spaces, utility units, mailboxes, and trash enclosures may not be counted in satisfying the open space requirement.

The director may waive the requirement for a coastal permit through a de minimis coastal permit waiver in compliance with this section upon a written determination that the development meets all of the criteria and procedural requirements set forth in subsections A through G of this section:

A. No Adverse Coastal Resource Impacts. The development has no potential for adverse effects, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources.

B. LCP Consistency. The development is consistent with the certified Capitola local coastal program.

C. Not Appealable to Coastal Commission. The development is not of a type or in a location where an action on the development would be appealable to the Coastal Commission.

D. Notice. Public notice of the proposed de minimis waiver of coastal permit and opportunities for public comment shall be provided as required by Chapter 17.148 (Public Notice and Hearings), including provision of notice to the Coastal Commission.

E. Executive Director Determination. The director shall provide a notice of determination to issue a de minimis waiver to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission no later than ten days prior to the required public hearing. If the Executive Director notifies the director that a waiver should not be issued, the applicant shall be required to obtain a coastal permit if the applicant wishes to proceed with the development.

F. Review and Concurrence. The director’s determination to issue a de minimis waiver shall be subject to review and concurrence by the community development director, planning commission or city council, as applicable. The director shall not issue a de minimis waiver until the public comment period, including at a minimum through and including the required public hearing, has expired. No de minimis waiver may be issued unless it has been reported to decision-makers at a regularly scheduled meeting where the public shall have the opportunity to testify and otherwise participate in a hearing on the de minimis waiver. If two or more decision-makers so request at this hearing, the de minimis waiver shall not be issued and, instead, an application for a coastal permit shall be required and processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Otherwise, the waiver shall be deemed approved, effective, and issued the day of the public hearing. In addition to the noticing requirements above, within seven calendar days of effective date of a de minimis waiver of coastal permit, the director shall notify the Coastal Commission and any persons who specifically requested notice of such action via first class mail, a notice of final action describing the issuance and effectiveness of the de minimis waiver.

G. Waiver Expiration. A de minimis waiver shall expire and be of no further force and effect if the authorized development is not completed within two years of the effective date of the waiver. In this event, a coastal permit shall be required for the development. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.44.100 Challenges to city determinations. Revised 6/18
A. General.

1. The determination of whether a development is nonappealable or appealable for purposes of notice, hearing, and appeals procedures shall be made by the community development director at the time the coastal permit application is submitted or as soon thereafter as possible, and in all cases prior to the application being deemed complete for processing.

2. This determination shall be made with reference to the certified local coastal program, including any maps, land use designations and zoning ordinances which are adopted as part of the local coastal program.

B. Procedure. Where an applicant, interested person, or the community development director has a question as to the appropriate designation for the development, the following procedures shall establish whether a development is nonappealable or appealable:

1. The community development director shall make its determination as to what type of development is being proposed and shall inform the applicant of the notice and hearing requirements for that particular development (i.e., appealable or nonappealable).

2. If the determination of the local government is challenged by the applicant or an interested person, or if the community development director wishes to have a Commission determination as to the appropriate designation, the community development director shall notify the Commission by telephone of the dispute/question and shall request an Executive Director’s opinion.

3. The Executive Director shall, within two working days of the request (or upon completion of a site inspection where such inspection is warranted), transmit his or her determination as to whether the development is nonappealable or appealable.

4. Where, after the Executive Director’s investigation, the Executive Director’s determination is not in accordance with the community development director’s determination, the Commission shall hold a hearing for purposes of determining the appropriate designation for the area. The Commission shall schedule the hearing on the determination for the next Commission meeting following the community development department request. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.44.110 Application submittal. Revised 6/18
A. Coastal permit applications shall be filed and reviewed in compliance with Chapter 17.112 (Permit Application and Review). The application shall include the information and materials required by the community development department, together with all required application fees.

B. Application for a coastal permit shall be made concurrently with application for any other permits or approvals required by the zoning code.

C. At time of submittal of coastal permit application, the city shall make a determination of whether the development is appealable or nonappealable in accordance with Section 17.44.100. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.44.120 Public notice and hearing. Revised 6/18
A. Planning Commission Review. The planning commission shall review and act on a coastal permit application at a noticed public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.148 (Public Notice and Hearings). However, processing at levels other than the planning commission shall apply in the following cases:

1. City Council Review. The proposed development does not require any other discretionary permit approvals to be reviewed and acted upon by the planning commission, in which case the coastal permit application will be reviewed and acted on by the city council; or

2. Minor Development. The city may waive the public hearing requirement for appealable development that qualifies as “minor development.” Such development shall require no other discretionary approval by the city. A public hearing may be waived if the project has no potential for adverse effects on coastal resources or public access to the shoreline, is consistent with the certified LCP, and if the following apply:

a. Notice that a public hearing would be held upon request is sent to all persons who would otherwise be required to be notified of a public hearing and any other persons who have shown interest;

b. No request for a public hearing is received within fifteen working days from the date notice was mailed out; and

c. The notice discloses that the failure to request a public hearing triggers the loss of appeal power on the matter being considered for administrative approval. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.44.130 Findings for approval. Revised 6/18

E. The project maintains public access to the coast along any coastline as set forth in the LCP.

F. The project supports the LCP goal of providing visitor serving needs as appropriate.

G. The project is consistent with the LCP goal of encouraging appropriate coastal development uses.

H. The proposed development protects and where feasible enhances coastal resources. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.44.140 Notice of final action. Revised 6/18
The city’s action on a coastal permit shall become final when all local rights of appeal have been exhausted per Section 17.44.150. Within seven calendar days of a final decision on a coastal permit application, the city shall provide notice of its action by first class mail to the applicant, the Coastal Commission, and any other persons who have requested such notice by submitting a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the city. The notice shall contain the city’s approved staff report, plans, adopted findings, conditions of approval, indication of whether the project is appealable to the Coastal Commission and the reasons for why it is or is not, and procedures for appeal to the Commission. The city’s decision on a coastal permit application shall be deemed final when all local rights of appeal have been exhausted as defined in Section 17.44.150 (Appeals). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.64.020 Applicability. Revised 6/18
This chapter applies to the following environmentally sensitive habitat areas. Environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHA) are any areas in which plant or animal life or their habitats are either rare or especially valuable because of their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by human activities and developments. ESHA includes wetlands, coastal streams and riparian vegetation, and terrestrial ESHA, including habitats of plant and animal species listed under the Federal or California Endangered Species Act. In addition, the following areas are ESHA as identified in Capitola’s LCP:

A. Soquel Creek, Lagoon, and Riparian Corridor.

B. Noble Gulch Riparian Corridor.

C. Tannery Gulch Riparian Corridor.

D. Monarch butterfly habitat – Rispin-Soquel Creek and Escalona Gulch. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.64.030 General standards. Revised 6/18
The following standards apply to all environmentally sensitive habitat areas:

A. Impact Prevention. Development within an environmentally sensitive habitat area shall be sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade the area.

B. Long-Term Protection. Development shall be sited, designed, and maintained to achieve the long-term protection of the environmentally sensitive habitat areas.

C. Prohibited Areas for Development. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, and with the exception of restoration and resource protection and enhancement activities, no new development may encroach into the waters of Soquel Creek or Lagoon, be sited within the root zone of riparian or butterfly host trees, or require the removal of trees in a Monarch butterfly habitat area which provide roosting habitat or wind protection.

D. Minimum Setbacks.

1. Development may not encroach into required minimum setbacks from environmentally sensitive habitat areas as shown in Table 17.64-1 (Required Setbacks from Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas), except as allowed in subsection (D)(2) of this section. The setbacks listed below are minimums and may be increased depending on the findings of the biological study required in subsection F of this section.

Note:

[1] Does not apply to public facilities outside the coastal zone. Within the coastal zone, applies to public facilities unless otherwise specified in Section 30233 of the Coastal Act.

2. To allow for a minimum level of development on a physically constrained lot, the city may allow a reduction to the required minimum setback provided that a biological study determines that the reduced setback does not have a significant adverse effect on the natural area.

E. Setback Exceptions on Developed Lots.

1. The city may grant an exception to the minimum setbacks in subsection D of this section (Minimum Setbacks) for the following projects on developed lots:

a. An addition or modification to an existing single-family home that does not extend further into the environmentally sensitive habitat area setback.

b. An accessory structure that complies with all applicable standards in Chapter 17.52 (Accessory Structures and Uses).

2. A developed lot means a lot that is developed or utilized to its ultimate potential use according to the applicable zoning district. For example, an R-1 lot that contains a single-family home or a permitted public/quasi-public use is considered developed. A residential or commercial lot that is vacant or used periodically for temporary uses (e.g., seasonal holiday sales) is not considered developed.

3. The city may grant an exception with the approval of an administrative permit upon finding that the project is:

a. Sited and designed to prevent impacts which would significantly degrade environmentally sensitive habitat areas; and

b. Is compatible with the continuance of habitat and recreation activities within environmentally sensitive habitat areas.

4. The city may attach conditions to the administrative permit to ensure compliance with all city policies and regulations pertaining to the protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas.

5. City approval of an exception shall not require the applicant to prepare a biological study.

F. Biological Study. For any proposed development within the ESHA areas identified above, the city shall contract with a qualified biologist at the applicant’s expense to prepare a biological study. Biological studies shall include the following:

1. Field surveys to determine the presence and location of any sensitive habitats and sensitive plant and animal species; and

2. A biological report which includes vegetation maps, a list of all observed native plant and animal species, an evaluation of other sensitive species which were not observed but have the potential to occur on the site, an impact analysis, and recommendations for avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating impacts. The biological report shall identify building setbacks, wetland buffers, landscape recommendations, and mitigation monitoring and reporting requirements as appropriate.

G. Conservation Easements and/or Deed Restrictions. If necessary and appropriate to protect natural areas, the city shall require a permanent conservation easement or deed restriction over any portion of the property containing environmentally sensitive habitat areas and their required setbacks.

H. Erosion Control and Water Quality.

1. All development shall conform to erosion control and water quality requirements consistent with federal, state, and local regulations. Within riparian areas, grading shall be minimized within the riparian setback area. Grading shall not be permitted to damage the roots of riparian trees or trees within butterfly habitat areas. Grading shall only take place during the dry season.

2. During construction, erosion control measures shall be implemented, including limiting removal of vegetation, minimizing exposure of bare soils, replanting disturbed soils with suitable native species, controlling runoff, and preventing sedimentation from entering drainages. All areas outside the immediate construction areas shall not be disturbed. The city shall require measures for temporary drainage retention during construction, including mulching, erosion control seeding, and other measures as needed to prevent any sediment from reaching sensitive habitat areas.

I. Removal of Native Riparian Trees. Removal of native riparian trees within riparian corridors is prohibited unless it is determined by the community development director, on the basis of an arborist report, that such removal is in the public interest by reason of good forestry practice, disease of the tree, or safety considerations.

J. Dead Trees in Riparian Corridors. Snags, or standing dead trees, shall not be removed from riparian corridors unless in imminent danger of falling. Removal shall be consistent with all applicable provisions of Chapter 12.12 (Community Tree and Forest Management). Any removed tree shall be replaced with a healthy young tree of an appropriate native riparian species or appropriate habitat for Monarch butterflies.

K. Landscaping Plan. A landscaping plan shall be prepared for proposed developments that identifies the location and extent of any proposed modification to existing vegetation and the locations, kinds, and extent of new landscaping. The emphasis of such plans shall be on the maintenance and enhancement of native species, the removal of existing invasive species, and the enhancement of natural habitat. New invasive plant or tree species are prohibited, with the exception of species which positively contribute to Monarch butterfly habitat.

L. Wood-Burning Fireplaces. Wood-burning fireplaces shall be prohibited in structures built on sites where Monarch butterflies may be disturbed due to chimney smoke. The city discourages wood-burning fireplaces for residential uses in all other areas of Capitola. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

B. Division of Land. New divisions of land may be approved only if each new parcel contains adequate area outside the riparian or stream bank setback to accommodate new development. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.64.050 Monarch butterfly habitat – Rispin-Soquel Creek and Escalona Gulch. Revised 6/18
The following standard applies to both the Rispin-Soquel Creek and the Escalona Gulch Monarch butterfly habitat areas in addition to the standards in Section 17.64.030 (General standards):

A. Permitted Construction Periods. Construction for otherwise allowable development within or on properties contiguous to the designated butterfly groves shall be prohibited during fall and winter months when the Monarch butterflies are present. Removal or modification of trees within the groves shall not be permitted during these periods except when determined by the community development director, on the basis of an arborist report, to be an emergency necessary to protect human life or property.

B. Tree Protection.

1. Development shall be sited and designed to avoid removal of large trees. New development located immediately adjacent to large trees shall be evaluated by an arborist to ensure that the development will not negatively impact the tree in the future.

2. Trees removed for construction shall be replaced based on a tree replanting program developed in consultation with a qualified Monarch butterfly expert. The trees shall be sited in strategic locations as identified by the replanting program.

3. Barrier fencing shall be installed around large trees, especially cluster trees, for protection during construction.

C. Structure Height. The city shall limit structure heights as needed to prevent shading of cluster sites.

D. Construction Involving Heavy Equipment.

17.76.020 Applicability. Revised 6/18
This chapter establishes parking requirements for three development scenarios: establishment of new structures and uses, replacement of existing uses, and expansion and enlargement of existing structures and uses.

A. New Structures and Uses. On-site parking and loading as required by this chapter shall be provided any time a new structure is constructed or a new land use is established.

B. Replacing Existing Uses.

1. Mixed Use Village Zoning District.

a. Where an existing residential use is changed to a commercial use in the mixed use village (MU-V) zoning district, parking shall be provided for the full amount required by the new use. No space credit for the previous use may be granted.

b. In all other changes of use in the mixed use village (MU-V) zoning district, additional parking is required to accommodate the incremental intensification of the new use. Additional parking is not required to remedy parking deficiencies existing prior to the change in use.

2. Other Zoning Districts. Where an existing use is changed to a new use outside of the mixed use village (MU-V) zoning district, additional parking is required to accommodate the incremental intensification of the new use. Additional parking is not required to remedy parking deficiencies existing prior to the change in use.

C. Expansions and Enlargements.

1. Nonresidential Use.

a. Where an existing structure with a nonresidential use is expanded or enlarged, additional parking is required to serve only the expanded or enlarged area, except as allowed by subsection (C)(1)(b) of this section.

b. Within the mixed use village (MU-V) zoning district, an eating and drinking establishment may expand by twenty percent of the existing floor area of the business without providing additional parking. Permitted expansions include modification of the internal building layout to enlarge the dining area, additions to the size of the business within an existing building footprint, and new outdoor dining areas.

2. Residential Use. For an existing structure with a residential use, the full amount of parking to serve the use is required when the floor area is increased by more than ten percent. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

C. Calculation of Required Spaces.

1. Floor Area. Where a parking requirement is a ratio of parking spaces to floor area, the floor area is assumed to be gross floor area, unless otherwise stated. The floor area of a use shall be calculated as described in Section 17.48.040 (Floor area and floor area ratio). Floor area for garages and other parking facilities are not included in the calculation of floor area for the purpose of determining on-site parking requirements.

2. Employees. Where a parking requirement is stated as a ratio of parking spaces to employees, the number of employees is based on the largest shift that occurs in a typical week.

3. Seats. Where a parking requirement is stated as a ratio of parking spaces to seats, each twenty-four inches of bench-type seating at maximum seating capacity is counted as one seat.

4. Fractional Spaces. In determining the number of required parking, fractions of spaces over one-half shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

D. Unlisted Uses. The parking requirement for land uses not listed in Table 17.76-1 and Table 17.76-2 shall be determined by the community development director based on the requirement for the most comparable similar use, the particular characteristics of the proposed use, and any other relevant data regarding parking demand.

E. Sites with Multiple Uses. Where more than one land use is conducted on a site, the minimum number of required on-site parking spaces shall be the sum of the number of parking spaces required for each individual use.

F. Additional Required Parking. The planning commission may require more on-site parking than required by Table 17.76-1 and Table 17.76-2 if the planning commission determines that additional parking is needed to serve the proposed use and to minimize adverse impacts on neighboring properties. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.76.040 General requirements. Revised 6/18
A. Availability and Use of Spaces.

1. In all zoning districts, required parking spaces shall be permanently available and maintained to provide parking for the use they are intended to serve.

2. Owners, lessees, tenants, or persons having control of the operation of a use for which parking spaces are required shall not prevent or restrict authorized persons from using these spaces.

3. A conditional use permit is required to designate parking spaces for exclusive use by an individual tenant within an integrated commercial complex.

4. Required parking spaces shall be used exclusively for the temporary parking of vehicles and shall not be used for the sale, lease, display, repair, advertising, or storage of vehicles, trailers, boats, campers, mobile homes, merchandise, or equipment, or for any other use not authorized by the zoning code.

B. Parking in Front and Exterior Side Setback Areas.

1. R-1 Zoning District. In the R-1 zoning district, the width of a parking space in the required front or exterior side setback area may not exceed forty percent of lot width up to a maximum of twenty feet, except that all lots may have a parking space of up to fourteen feet in width regardless of lot width. See Figure 17.76-1. The planning commission may allow a larger parking area within the required front and exterior side setback areas with a design permit if the larger parking area incorporates design features, such as impervious materials and enhanced landscaping, that minimize visual impacts to the neighborhood.

Figure 17.76-1: Parking in Front Setback Area in R-1 Zoning District

2. Other Zoning Districts.

a. In all zoning districts other than the R-1 zoning district, required parking spaces may not be located within required front or exterior side setback areas.

b. In the mixed use village zoning district, parking may be located adjacent to the street-facing property line in accordance with Section 17.20.030(E)(5) (Parking Location and Buffers).

c. In the mixed use neighborhood zoning district, parking may be located in the front or exterior side setback area if approved by the planning commission in accordance with Section 17.20.040(E) (Parking Location and Buffers).

C. Location of Parking.

1. All Zoning Districts. Required parking spaces may not be located within any public or private right-of-way unless located in a sidewalk exempt area and an encroachment permit is granted.

2. R-1 Zoning District. Required parking spaces in the R-1 zoning district shall be on the same parcel as the use that they serve.

3. MU-V Zoning District. Required parking spaces for new nonresidential development and intensified uses in the MU-V zoning district shall be provided on sites outside of the Village area. These spaces shall be within walking distance of the use which it serves or at remote sites served by a shuttle system. The planning commission may approve exceptions to allow on-site parking in the MU-V district for:

a. The Capitola Theater site (APN 035-262-04) and Mercantile site (APN 035-221-17) if driveway cuts are minimized to the extent possible and parking areas are located on the interior of the sites; and

b. If mandated under Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations and as consistent with the certified local coastal program.

4. Other Zoning Districts. In all zoning districts other than the R-1 and MU-V zoning districts, required parking shall be located on the same lot as the use they are intended to serve, except as allowed by Section 17.76.050(D).

D. Large Vehicle Storage in the R-1 Zoning District. In addition to the required on-site parking spaces for a single-family dwelling, one additional on-site parking or storage space may be provided on a parcel in the R-1 zoning district for a recreational vehicle, boat, camper, or similar vehicle. This space may not be located in a required front or exterior side setback area and may be utilized only to store a vehicle that does not exceed thirteen and one-half feet in height, eight and one-half feet in width, and twenty-five feet in length. Such parking or storage spaces shall be finished in concrete, asphalt, semi-permeable pavers, or a similar paved surface.

E. Covered Parking in the R-1 Zoning District.

1. When required by this chapter, covered parking spaces serving a single-family dwelling shall be provided within an enclosed garage. The planning commission may allow required covered parking spaces to be provided within an open carport with a design permit if the planning commission finds that a garage is practically infeasible or that a carport results in a superior project design.

2. All carports serving a single-family dwelling shall comply with the following design standards:

a. Carports shall be designed with high quality materials, compatible with the home. The roofing design, pitch, colors, exterior materials and supporting posts shall be similar to the home. The carport shall appear substantial and decoratively finished in a style matching the home which it serves.

b. The slope of a carport roof shall substantially match the roof slope of the home which it serves.

c. Pedestrian pathways connecting the carport with the home shall be provided.

3. Garages in the R-1 zoning district may be converted to habitable living space only if the total number of required on-site parking spaces is maintained, including covered spaces for the covered parking space requirement.

F. Electric Vehicle Charging.

1. When Required. Electric vehicle charging stations shall be provided:

a. For new structures or uses required to provide at least twenty-five parking spaces; and

b. Additions or remodels that increase an existing parking lot of fifty or more spaces by ten percent or more.

1. Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be provided in compliance with California Code of Regulations Title 24.

2. Parking spaces required for the disabled shall count toward compliance with the number of parking spaces required by Table 17.76-1 and Table 17.76-2.

H. Curb-Side Service.

1. Curb-side (drive-up) service for retail uses is allowed in all commercial and mixed use zoning districts.

2. Restaurant curb-side service requires a conditional use permit in the regional commercial (C-R) zoning district and is prohibited in all other zoning districts. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.76.050 On-site parking alternatives. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose. This section identifies alternatives to required on-site parking to:

1. Allow for creative parking solutions;

2. Enhance economic vitality in Capitola;

3. Promote walking, biking, and use of transit; and

4. Encourage the efficient use of land resources consistent with the general plan.

B. Eligibility. Alternatives to required on-site parking in this section are available only to uses located outside of the mixed use village zoning district, except for:

1. Valet parking (subsection F of this section) which is available in all zoning districts, including the mixed use village zoning district; and

2. Fees in lieu of parking (subsection I of this section), which are available only to uses in the mixed use village zoning district.

C. Required Approval. All reductions in on-site parking described in this section require planning commission approval of a conditional use permit.

D. Off-Site Parking.

1. For multifamily housing and nonresidential uses, the planning commission may allow off-site parking if the commission finds that practical difficulties prevent the parking from being located on the same lot it is intended to serve.

2. Off-site parking shall be located within a reasonable distance of the use it is intended to serve, as determined by the planning commission.

3. A deed restriction or other legal instrument, approved by the city attorney, shall be filed with the county recorder. The covenant record shall require the owner of the property where the on-site parking is located to continue to maintain the parking space so long as the building, structure, or improvement is maintained in Capitola. This covenant shall stipulate that the title and right to use the parcels shall not be subject to multiple covenants or contracts for use without prior written consent of the city.

E. Shared Parking. Multiple land uses on a single parcel or development site may use shared parking facilities when operations for the land uses are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use differ. The planning commission may allow shared parking subject to the following requirements:

1. A parking demand study prepared by a specialized consultant contracted by the community development director, paid for by the applicant, and approved by the planning commission demonstrates that there will be no substantial conflicts between the land uses’ principal hours of operation and periods of peak parking demand.

2. The total number of parking spaces required for the land uses does not exceed the number of parking spaces anticipated at periods of maximum use.

3. The proposed shared parking facility is located no further than four hundred feet from the primary entrance of the land use which it serves.

4. In the mixed use neighborhood (MU-N) zoning district the reduction for shared parking is no greater than twenty-five percent of the required on-site parking spaces.

F. Valet Parking. The planning commission may allow up to twenty-five percent of the required on-site parking spaces to be off-site valet spaces (except for a hotel on the former Village Theater site (APN 035-262-04, 035-262-02, and 035-261-10) for which there is no maximum limit of off-site valet spaces). Valet parking shall comply with the following standards:

1. Valet parking lots must be staffed when business is open by an attendant who is authorized and able to move vehicles.

2. A valet parking plan shall be reviewed and approved by the community development director in consultation with the public works director.

3. Valet parking may not interfere with or obstruct vehicle or pedestrian circulation on the site or on any public street or sidewalk.

4. The use served by valet parking shall provide a designated drop-off and pick-up area. The drop-off and pick-up area may be located adjacent to the building, but it may not be located within a fire lane, impede vehicular and/or pedestrian circulation, or cause queuing in the right-of-way or drive aisle.

G. Low Demand. The number of required on-site parking spaces may be reduced if the planning commission finds that the land use will not utilize the required number of spaces due to the nature of the specific use. This finding shall be supported by the results of a parking demand study approved by the community development director in consultation with the public works director.

H. Transportation Demand Management Plan. The planning commission may reduce the number of required on-site parking spaces for employers that adopt and implement a transportation demand management (TDM) plan subject to the following requirements and limitations:

1. A TDM plan reduction is available only to employers with twenty-five or more employees.

2. Required on-site parking spaces may be reduced by no more than fifteen percent.

3. The TDM plan shall be approved by the community development director in consultation with the public works director.

4. The TDM plan shall identify specific measures that will measurably reduce the demand for on-site parking spaces. Acceptable measures must ensure a reduced demand for parking spaces (e.g., an employee operated shuttle program). Measures that only encourage the use of transit, ridesharing, biking, or walking will not be accepted.

5. The employer shall appoint a program coordinator to oversee transportation demand management activities.

6. The program coordinator must provide a report annually to the planning commission that details the implementation strategies and effectiveness of the TDM plan.

7. The planning commission may revoke the TDM plan at any time and require additional parking spaces on site upon finding that the plan has not been implemented as required or that the plan has not produced the reduction in the demand for on-site parking spaces as originally intended.

I. Fees in Lieu of Parking.

1. Within the MU-V zoning district, on-site parking requirements for hotel uses may be satisfied by payment of an in-lieu parking fee established by the city council to provide an equivalent number of parking spaces in a municipal parking lot. Such payment must be made before issuance of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy. Requests to participate in an in-lieu parking program must be approved by the city council.

2. Fee revenue must be used to provide public parking in the vicinity of the use. In establishing parking districts, the city council may set limitations on the number of spaces or the maximum percentage of parking spaces required for which an in-lieu fee may be tendered.

J. Transit Center Credit. Provided a regional transit center is located within the Capitola Mall property, the planning commission may reduce the number of required parking spaces by up to ten percent for residential mixed use projects in the Capitola Mall property bounded by Clares Street, Capitola Road, and 41st Avenue. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.80.120 Adjustment to sign standards. Revised 6/18
This section establishes procedures to allow the planning commission to approve signs that deviate from certain standards to provide reasonable flexibility in the administration of the sign ordinance.

A. Permit Required. Adjustments to sign standards allowed by this section requires planning commission approval of a sign permit.

B. Permitted Adjustments. The planning commission may allow adjustment to the following sign standards:

1. The type of sign allowed in nonresidential zoning districts (e.g., awning signs, monument signs).

2. Requirements for temporary signs.

3. The maximum permitted sign area up to a twenty-five percent increase.

4. The maximum permitted sign height up to a twenty-five percent increase.

C. Excluded Adjustments. The planning commission may not use the sign standards adjustment process to approve deviations to the following sign standards:

1. Prohibited signs (Section 17.80.060).

2. All general sign standards (Section 17.80.070) except maximum permitted sign area (17.80.070(A)).

3. Maximum number of signs allowed per property.

4. Residential signs (Section 17.80.100).

D. Findings. The planning commission may approve an adjustment to sign standards as allowed by this section if the following findings can be made in addition to findings required to approve sign permit applications:

1. The sign will be compatible with adjacent structures and uses and is consistent with the character of the neighborhood or district where it is located.

2. The sign will not adversely impact neighboring properties or the community at large.

3. The adjustment is necessary due to unique characteristics of the subject property, structure, or use.

4. The sign will be consistent with the purpose of the zoning district, the general plan, local coastal program, and any adopted area or neighborhood plan.

5. The adjustment will not establish an undesirable precedent.

E. Low Visibility Commercial Properties.

1. In addition to adjustments allowed by subsections A through D of this section, the planning commission may allow additional adjustments to sign standards for low visibility properties in the C-R and C-C zoning districts. A low visibility property means a property where signage consistent with applicable standards would not be easily visible from the street or sidewalk due to the width of street frontage, parcel depth or configuration, placement of buildings on the property, topography, vegetation, or other physical characteristic of the property.

2. Adjustments to sign standards for low visibility properties require planning commission approval of a sign permit.

3. Adjustments are allowed to required sign types, height, size, placement, and number. Adjustments may not allow for prohibited signs or monument signs.

4. The planning commission may approve additional or variations to any type of signage upon making the following findings:

a. The special signage, as designed and conditioned, is necessary and appropriate for the subject commercial site, in order to allow the site and the businesses located within it to be competitive with other businesses of a similar nature located elsewhere, and/or to be competitive with industry standards governing sale of the merchandise offered at the site.

b. The special signage, as designed and conditioned, will not have a significant adverse effect on the character and integrity of the surrounding area. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.80.130 Master sign program. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose. The purpose of the master sign program is to provide a coordinated approach to signage for multifamily development and multi-tenant commercial developments.

B. Applicability. A master sign program is required for multifamily uses with more than one permanent sign proposed, and any nonresidential development with four or more tenants.

C. Permit Required. A master sign program requires planning commission approval of a sign permit.

D. Applications. Applications shall be filed with the planning department on the appropriate city forms, together with all the necessary fees, deposits, exhibits, maps, and other information required by the department to clearly and accurately describe the proposed master sign program.

E. Master Sign Program Contents. All master sign programs shall identify the materials, color, size, type, placement and general design of signs located on a project or property.

F. Design Standards.

1. Master sign programs shall feature a unified and coordinated approach to the materials, size, type, placement and general design of signs proposed for a project or property. Master sign programs may allow for variety in the design of individual signs.

2. A master sign program may deviate from standards contained in this chapter relating to permitted sign height, number of signs, sign area, and type of sign. A master sign program may not allow prohibited signs as identified in Section 17.80.060 (Prohibited signs).

G. Effect of Master Sign Program.

1. All subsequent signs proposed for a development or property subject to an approved master sign program shall comply with the standards and specifications included in the master sign program.

2. Signs consistent with an approved master sign program are allowed with an administrative sign permit.

3. Approval of a master sign program shall supersede the regulations of this chapter. Any aspect of the proposed signs not addressed by the master sign program shall be in compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.80.140 Nonconforming signs. Revised 6/18
This section applies to all legally established signs that do not conform to current requirements in this chapter.

A. Continuation.

1. Except as required by subsection (A)(2) of this section, a nonconforming sign may continue its use as a sign if it was legally established in compliance with all applicable regulations in effect at the time it was established. It is the applicant’s responsibility to demonstrate that the sign was legally established.

(Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.84.060 Criteria for designating historic resources. Revised 6/18
A. Designated Historic Resources. Designated historic resources represent particularly noteworthy community resources that exemplify the city’s unique historic identity, primarily from the pre-World War II era of Capitola’s history. Designated historic resources possess iconic landmark status that contribute to Capitola’s unique sense of place due to physical characteristics of the resource visible from a public place. The city council may classify a property as a designated historic resource if it meets any of the following criteria:

1. It exemplifies or reflects special elements of the city’s cultural, social, economic, political, aesthetic, engineering, architectural or natural history.

2. It embodies distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period or method of construction, or is a valuable example of the uses of indigenous materials or craftsmanship.

3. It is an example of a type of building once common in Capitola but now rare.

4. It contributes to the significance of an historic area, being a geographically definable area possessing a concentration of historic or scenic properties or thematically related groupings of properties which contribute to each other and are united aesthetically by plan or physical development.

B. Potential Historic Resource. Based on a recommendation from the city’s architectural historian, the community development director may add a structure to the potential historic resource list if it meets any of the above criteria for classifying a designated historic resource or any of the following criteria:

1. It has a unique location or singular physical characteristic or is a view or vista representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, district, or the city.

2. It embodies elements of architectural design, detail, materials or craftsmanship that represent a significant structural or architectural achievement or innovation.

3. It is similar to other distinctive properties, sites, areas or objects based on an historic, cultural or architectural motif.

4. It is one of the few remaining examples in the city, region, state or nation possessing distinguishing characteristics of an architectural or historic type or specimen. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.84.070 Historic alteration permit. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose. A historic alteration permit is an approval required to alter the exterior of a historic resource.

B. Requirement for Designated Historic Resources. A historic alteration permit is required for any exterior alteration to a designated historic resource as defined in Section 17.84.020 (Types of historic resources).

C. Requirement for Potential Historic Resource.

1. When Permit Is Required. A historic alteration permit is required for an alteration to a potential historic resource if:

a. The project requires a discretionary approval (e.g., design permit); and

b. The community development director determines that the project may result in a significant adverse impact of a historic resource as defined in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15064.5. A structure found not to be historically significant through a historic evaluation does not require a historic alteration permit.

2. Historic Resource Assessment and Consultation. A proposed alteration to a designated historic resource or a potential historic resource that requires a discretionary permit will be reviewed by the city’s architectural historian to assess if the project may result in a significant adverse impact of a historic resource. The community development director shall use this assessment to determine if the findings of approval for the historic alteration permit can be made. Review by the city’s architectural historian is not required for in-kind repairs in accordance with subsection E of this section (Exception for Preservation and In-Kind Rehabilitation).

D. Alteration Defined. As used in this chapter, “alteration” means any exterior change or modification to a structure, cutting or removal of trees and other natural features, disturbance of archeological sites or areas, and the placement or removal of any accessory structures affecting the exterior visual qualities of the property. Painting is not considered an alteration unless painted features are designated as significant or characteristic of a historic resource.

E. Exception for Preservation and In-Kind Rehabilitation. A historic alteration permit is not required for preservation or rehabilitation due to damage to windows, doors, trim, or other similar building elements. The rehabilitation shall be in-kind, matching the original design in size, detail, materials, and function. To qualify for this exception, the applicant must provide evidence of original design and details of the in-kind replacement.

F. Review Authority. The planning commission shall take action on all applications for a historic alteration permit.

G. Application Requirements. Applications for a historic alteration permit shall be filed and reviewed in compliance with Chapter 17.112 (Permit Application and Review). The application shall include the information and materials required by the community development department together with all required application fees.

H. Public Notice and Hearing. The planning commission shall consider applications for a historic alteration permit at a noticed public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.148 (Public Notice and Hearings).

I. Findings for Approval. The planning commission may approve a historic alteration permit only if all of the following findings can be made:

1. The historic character of a property is retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the property is avoided.

2. Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of fine craftsmanship that characterize a property are preserved.

3. Any new additions complement the historic character of the existing structure. New building components and materials for the addition are similar in scale and size to those of the existing structure.

4. Deteriorated historic features are repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature matches the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials.

5. Archeological resources are protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures are undertaken.

6. The proposed project is consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, the zoning code, and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

J. Conditions of Approval. The planning commission may attach conditions of approval to a historic alteration permit to achieve consistency with the general plan, local coastal program, zoning code, and any applicable specific plan or area plan adopted by the city council.

K. Appeals. Decisions on historic alteration permit may be appealed as described in Chapter 17.152 (Appeals). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

D. Planning Commission Recommendation. For historic resource demolition permit applications to demolish a designated historic resource, the planning commission shall provide a recommendation to the city council on a historic resource demolition permit at a noticed public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.148 (Public Notice and Hearings). The planning commission shall base its recommendation on the findings specified in subsection F of this section (Findings for Approval).

E. Public Notice and Hearing. The review authority shall review and act on a historic resource demolition permit at a noticed public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.148 (Public Notice and Hearings).

F. Findings for Approval. To approve a historic resource demolition permit, the review authority shall make one or more of the following findings:

1. The structure must be demolished because it presents an imminent hazard to public health and safety as determined by a licensed structural engineer.

17.92.010 Purpose. Revised 6/18
This chapter establishes regulations for nonconforming parcels, uses and structures. These regulations are intended to:

A. Allow for the development and use of legal nonconforming parcels.

B. Ensure that nonconforming uses and structures do not adversely impact neighboring properties.

C. Allow for the limited enlargement or intensification of nonconforming uses and structures.

F. Provide for the elimination of nonconforming uses as appropriate due to abandonment, obsolescence, and destruction. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.020 Applicability. Revised 6/18
This chapter applies to existing parcels, uses, and structures that do not conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. Any policies that are inconsistent shall be interpreted in the manner that is more protective of coastal resources. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.030 General. Revised 6/18
A. Continuation. A nonconforming parcel, use, or structure may be continued if it was legally established in compliance with all applicable regulations in effect at the time it was established.

B. Legally Established Defined. To be considered legally established, a legal nonconforming parcel, use, or structure shall have been physically constructed or in existence, not merely approved by the city. Conditional use permits, variances, coastal permits, building permits, or other approvals not exercised within the required time do not establish the right to a legal nonconformity.

C. Burden of Proof. Any person asserting a right to a nonconforming parcel, use or structure has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the nonconformity was legally established. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.040 Nonconforming parcels. Revised 6/18
A. Development Permitted. A legally established parcel with nonconforming dimensions (e.g., parcel width, depth, and size) is permitted all development rights of the applicable zoning district.

B. Conformance with Standards. New development on legal nonconforming parcels shall comply with all setback, building coverage, parking, and other standards of the applicable zoning district, as well as all applicable geologic and environmentally sensitive habitat setbacks. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.050 Nonconforming use of land. Revised 6/18
A. Continuation Permitted. A nonconforming use of land conducted outside of a structure may continue so long as:

1. The nonconforming use is not enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land; and

2. The nonconforming use is not moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the parcel.

B. Cessation of Use. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of more than one hundred eighty consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district. For the purpose of this section, a use is considered ceased if any of the following apply:

1. The use is not present on the site;

2. For uses that serve customers (e.g., restaurants), the use no longer serves customers; and/or

3. For uses with employees, no employees (including the owner) are present on the site. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.060 Nonconforming use of structures. Revised 6/18
A. Change in Ownership, Tenancy, or Management. A change in ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its legal nonconforming status.

B. Resuming a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use changed to a conforming use shall not return to a nonconforming use.

C. Replacement of a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may not be replaced by another nonconforming use.

D. Intensification of Use.

1. The enlargement of a structure or parcel occupied by a nonconforming use, or the intensification in any way of the operation of a nonconforming use, requires the approval of a conditional use permit.

2. To approve a proposed intensification to a nonconforming use, the planning commission shall make all conditional use permit findings (Chapter 17.124) in addition to the findings in Section 17.92.090 (Findings).

E. Discontinuation of Use. A nonconforming use discontinued for ninety consecutive days shall not be reestablished and may be replaced only by a conforming use.

F. Nonconforming Multifamily Uses. Nonconforming multifamily uses in the residential single-family (R-1) zoning district shall comply with Section 17.92.070 (Nonconforming multifamily uses in the R-1 zoning district). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.070 Nonconforming multifamily uses in the R-1 zoning district. Revised 6/18
This section applies to multifamily uses that are nonconforming due to their location in the residential single-family (R-1) zoning district.

A. Amortization. A nonconforming multifamily use in the R-1 zoning district must be discontinued on June 26, 2019, or fifty years from the date the use first became nonconforming, whichever is later, except as provided in subsections B and C of this section.

B. Amortization Extensions.

1. An owner of a nonconforming multifamily use may apply to the city council for an extension to the amortization requirement in subsection A of this section.

2. The city council may grant an extension of up to twenty-five years upon finding that:

a. The appearance, condition and management of the property is such that the property is not greatly detrimental to the single-family residential character of the neighborhood in which it is located;

b. The extension is necessary in order to prevent a major economic loss to the property owner and to lessen deterioration;

c. All reasonable conditions have been imposed for the purpose of repairing dilapidation and bringing, or keeping, the property up to neighborhood standards; and

3. The multifamily use must be discontinued upon completion of the extended amortization period granted by the city council. In such cases, the property may continue as a residential use only if converted to a single-family dwelling. A property may not apply for another extension upon the completion of the granted amortization extension period.

C. Incentives for Property Improvement.

1. Incentive Program. To encourage upgrades and improvements to nonconforming multifamily uses in the R-1 zoning district, the city council may grant permanent legal status to properties that satisfy the requirements of the city’s nonconforming multifamily improvement incentive program. Properties that satisfy the requirements of the incentive program are exempt from the amortization requirement established in subsections A and B of this section.

2. Submittal Requirements. To participate in the incentive program, a property owner shall prepare and submit to the city a property improvement plan that contains the following:

a. A general description of the property, including property ownership, current and prior uses on the property, history of property improvements and maintenance, and aspects of the property that do not comply with current zoning regulations.

b. Proposed improvements to bring the property into greater compliance with development standards required by the zoning code, including parking and landscaping requirements. These improvements may include reduction of the number of units on the property.

c. A description of any neighborhood compatibility concerns associated with the property, including parking, noise, property maintenance, and refuse and recycling storage issues.

d. Proposed property improvement and maintenance measures to address any neighborhood compatibility concerns.

e. Documentation of outreach to neighbors to gather information about neighborhood compatibility concerns and possible methods to address these concerns.

f. A description of any necessary measures to mitigate for any impacts to coastal resources.

3. Measures to Compensate for Impacts. A property owner may also propose additional measures that would provide a neighborhood benefit to compensate for impacts from the nonconforming use that cannot be fully mitigated. For example, a property owner may propose reducing the number of residential units in a building, providing shared parking, screening trash facilities, improving building and site design, adding or upgrading landscaping, providing units as deed-restricted affordable housing, or installing green building upgrades that exceed the city’s green building award status.

4. City Review. The community development director, in consultation with the public works director, shall review the property improvement plan and determine if the plan correctly identifies issues associated with the property and adequately proposes improvements to address these issues. The community development director shall forward to the planning commission and city council a recommendation on the adequacy of the plan.

5. Property Improvement Agreement and Schedule. The property improvement plan shall identify a realistic schedule to complete all proposed improvements within two years of city council approval. The property owner shall enter into a property improvement agreement with the city agreeing to complete all proposed improvements within this established schedule.

6. Findings. At a noticed public hearing, the city council may grant legal nonconforming status to a property upon finding that:

a. The property improvement plan, when implemented, will adequately address any neighborhood compatibility concerns previously associated with the property.

b. The property improvement plan incorporates adequate monitoring and maintenance provisions to ensure that neighborhood compatibility issues will not reoccur in the future.

c. The location and size of the site is suitable and appropriate for a multifamily use.

d. The property as improved will feature high quality design elements that complement the aesthetic qualities of the neighborhood.

e. The property will not produce unreasonable privacy, noise, light, and air impacts on neighboring properties.

f. Sufficient off-street parking is provided to accommodate parking needs of residents and minimize parking impacts on neighboring properties. Vehicles will not be parked in a manner that projects into adjacent sidewalks, streets, or otherwise interferes with vehicle and pedestrian circulation adjacent to the site.

g. Refuse and recycling storage facilities are provided on site and screened from view from neighboring properties and the street.

h. The granting of legal status will not result in an excessive concentration of multifamily uses in the immediate vicinity of the property.

i. Community benefits, if proposed, sufficiently compensate for impacts from the nonconforming use that cannot be fully mitigated.

7. Revocation. The city may at any time revoke the legal status of the property if the property violates the improvement and maintenance agreement. Revocation shall occur in a manner consistent with Section 17.156.110 (Permit revocation). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

Notes:

[1] The proposed project may require permits and approvals for other reasons not related to its nonconforming status. For example, additions or enlargements to a single-family dwelling often requires a design permit.

[2] Repairs and replacement of exterior finishes such as roofs and exterior siding are allowed without a design permit.

A. Alterations Permitted by Right.

1. Interior repairs, maintenance and alterations to any portion of a nonconforming structure are permitted if the changes and improvements do not enlarge or expand the structure.

2. Exterior modifications to a nonconforming structure that do not alter or affect the nonconforming aspect of the structure are permitted. For example, an addition to a structure with a nonconforming setback is permitted if no changes are made to the portion of the structure projecting into the required setback, and if the addition complies with all setback, height, floor area ratio, and other applicable development standards.

B. Alterations and Additions Requiring a Design Permit.

1. Exterior repairs and improvements that affect the nonconforming aspect of a nonconforming structure are allowed with a design permit if the improvement does not increase or exacerbate the nonconformity. For example, rebuilding a building wall within a required setback is permitted with a design permit if the wall is not moved closer to the property line and the length of the wall within the required setback is not increased.

2. The planning commission may approve an alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure that renovates, reconstructs, or replicates the nonconforming aspect of the structure with a design permit. The addition may not increase or exacerbate the nonconformity and may not exceed fifty percent of the floor area of the existing structure.

3. To approve such alterations and additions, the planning commission shall make all design permit findings (Chapter 17.120) in addition to the findings in Section 17.92.090 (Findings).

C. Reconstruction of Single-Family Dwellings.

1. A nonconforming single-family dwelling may be reconstructed with the approval of a design permit. This provision is intended to allow for improvements to housing in Capitola in a manner that maintains the historic coastal village character of residential neighborhoods.

2. “Reconstruction” as used in this subsection means the replacement of a demolished structure which recreates the original building footprint, mass, floor area, height, and roof lines. Deviation from existing design details such as the arrangement of doors and windows, materials, and color may be permitted. Exact reconstruction may not be possible due to the unavailability of matching materials and/or the necessity to meet current building code requirements.

3. A nonconforming single-family dwelling is not eligible for reconstruction if the mass and floor area of the existing home can be reconfigured on the parcel in a manner consistent with the development standards of the applicable zoning district. Reconstruction provisions are intended to apply only to homes on constrained parcels where compliance with applicable development standards is not feasible.

4. Deviations from the original building design that would reduce a nonconformity are allowed, and encouraged in cases where the deviation does not adversely impact the architectural integrity of the home.

5. To approve such a reconstruction, the planning commission shall make all design permit findings (Chapter 17.120) in addition to the findings in Section 17.92.090 (Findings), and must find that the reconstruction contributes to the preservation of Capitola’s coastal village character.

6. No additions or modifications that would increase the mass, floor area or height of a replicated nonconforming single-family dwelling are permitted for up to ten years following approval of the reconstructed home.

D. Involuntary Damage or Destruction.

1. Nonconforming structures damaged or destroyed by earthquake, fire, flood, or other calamity may be repaired or reconstructed provided that the nonconforming aspects of the structure are not increased or exacerbated.

2. “Reconstruction” as used in this subsection means the replacement of a demolished structure which recreates the original building footprint, mass, floor area, height, and roof lines. Deviation from existing design details such as the arrangement of doors and windows, materials, and color may be permitted. Exact reconstruction may not be possible due to the unavailability of matching materials and/or the necessity to meet current building code requirements.

3. The repair or reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall begin within one year and shall be completed within three years. The community development director may approve an extension of two additional years to complete reconstruction of the demolished structure if the delay was caused by circumstances over which the applicant has no fault or control.

E. Moved Structures. A nonconforming structure that is moved to a new location shall conform to all applicable standards of the applicable zoning district. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.92.090 Findings. Revised 6/18
The planning commission may approve a design permit for projects that alter or affect the nonconforming aspect of a structure and for the replication of a single-family dwelling if all of the following findings can be made in addition to the findings in Chapter 17.120 (Design Permits):

A. Available evidence indicates that the nonconforming use or structure was legally established.

B. The nonconforming use or structure has not resulted in a notable negative impact or nuisance on neighboring properties or to the surrounding area.

C. The nonconforming use or structure is compatible with the general character of the surrounding area.

D. The proposed action is consistent with the purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.100.040 Relocation impact report. Revised 6/18
A. Submittal to Director. Prior to a change of use of a mobile home park, a relocation impact report (RIR) complying with the requirements of this chapter must be filed with the director. It is the park owner’s responsibility to comply with the notice requirements of Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(1) and (2). Because the Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(2) notice cannot be given until after the approval of both the project and the sufficiency of the RIR, the park owner is encouraged to consult with staff (especially if any waiver of requirements in subsection B of this section (Required Information) will be requested) early in the process about the contents of the RIR.

B. Required Information. The RIR shall be prepared by an independent agent acceptable to the city at the applicant’s expense and shall include the following information unless the director determines the information is not necessary:

1. A detailed description of the proposed change of use, or change without new use.

2. A timetable for conversion of the mobile home park.

3. A legal description of the mobile home park.

4. The number of spaces in the park, length of occupancy by the current occupant of each space and current rental rate for each space.

5. The date of manufacture and size of each mobile home.

6. Appraisals addressing relevant issues identified by the director. A qualified appraiser shall be selected by the city and the cost of the appraisals shall be borne by the applicant. The appraisals shall identify those mobile homes which cannot be moved due to type, age or other considerations. Appraisal information shall be provided on the effect upon the homeowner’s investment in the mobile home, such as the change in value of effected mobile homes that would result from the proposed change of use.

7. The results of questionnaires to all homeowners/occupants regarding the following: whether the occupant owns or rents, whether this is the only residence, occupants’ ages, whether the occupants have disabilities that would be aggravated by the moving process, the purchase date and price paid by the mobile home owner, the costs incurred by the mobile home owner in improving the home, and the amount and relevant terms of any remaining mortgage. Answering such questionnaire shall be voluntary.

8. The name and mailing address of each eligible resident, mobile home tenant, mobile home resident, resident mobile home owner and legal owner of a mobile home in the park.

9. The purchase price of condominiums similar in size to the mobile homes within a reasonable distance, and the rental rates and moving costs involved in moving to an apartment or other rental unit within a reasonable distance including, but not limited to, fees charged by moving companies and any requirement for payment of the first and last month’s rent and security deposits.

10. A list of comparable mobile home parks within a twenty-mile radius and a list of comparable mobile home parks within a radius of twenty-five to fifty miles of the applicant’s mobile home park. For each comparable park, the list should, if possible, state the criteria of that park for accepting relocated mobile homes, rental rates and the name, address and telephone number of the park representative having authority to accept relocated homes, including any written commitments from mobile home park owners willing to accept displaced mobile homes. The purpose of this requirement is to provide information necessary to create appropriate relocation compensation. It is not meant to suggest that the city, in any sense, favors tenants relocating out of any mobile home park in Capitola.

11. Estimates from two moving companies as to the minimum and per mile cost of moving each mobile home, including tear-down and set-up of mobile homes and moving of improvements such as porches, carports, patios and other movable amenities installed by the residents. Said moving companies shall be approved by the director prior to inclusion in the final RIR.

12. Proposed measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of the conversion upon the mobile home park residents.

13. Identification of a relocation specialist to assist residents in finding relocation spaces and alternate housing. The specialist shall be selected by the applicant, subject to the city’s approval, and shall be paid for by the applicant.

C. Filing of Relocation Impact Report. The city shall not consider an RIR to be filed, within the meaning of Government Code Section 65863.7, until the applicant has submitted to the community development department both a draft RIR which applicant believes meets the requirements of subsection B of this section (Required Information), and a written statement that such draft RIR has been filed pursuant to Government Code Section 65863.7.

D. Refusal to Review Relocation Impact Report. If the city attorney determines that the proposed conversion or closure of the mobile home park would be illegal, the community development director shall not process the RIR unless a court of competent jurisdiction rules that the proposed use would be legal. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.100.050 Notice to prospective occupants of pending change in park status. Revised 6/18

Notice shall be given in addition to notices required by Civil Code Section 798.56(g)(1) and in all cases shall be given prior to execution of any new rental agreement. The park owner shall obtain a signed acknowledgment of receipt of such notice from each prospective purchaser or tenant and file it with the director. If the prospective purchaser or tenant refuses to sign, a dependable record of delivery of notice shall be maintained by the park owner. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

When an application and RIR have been accepted as complete, the director shall set a time, date and place for a hearing before the planning commission not later than sixty days after the date of acceptance. Because certain required information in an RIR (e.g., appraisals, tenant data) cannot be obtained until after filing an application for change of use, the initial application for change of use and RIR shall contain all pertinent available information to start the process of obtaining the information required for a complete application and RIR.

B. Owner and Resident Notice. Not less than thirty days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the planning commission, the park owner shall deliver to each mobile home owner and resident within the park a copy of the approved RIR and the notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing on the application. Notice shall be delivered by certified mail or personal delivery.

C. Verification of Notice Requirements. Not less than fifteen days prior to the scheduled public hearing before the planning commission on the RIR, the park owner shall file with the director a verification of noticing required by this chapter and Government Code Section 65863.7.

c. Payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any differential between rental rates at the closing mobile home park and the new mobile home park during the first year of the new tenancy.

d. For those mobile home residents who move to apartments or other rental housing alternatives, payment of a lump sum based on consideration of any differential in the rental rate between the closing park and the comparable housing, requirements for payment of security deposits and cleaning fees. Mobile home households may be compensated based on the number of bedrooms in the mobile home so that a one bedroom mobile home may be compensated based on a one bedroom apartment, a two bedroom mobile home based on a two bedroom apartment, etc.

e. Provision of a replacement space within a reasonable distance of the closing mobile home park.

f. For residents whose mobile home cannot be relocated to a comparable park within a fifty-mile radius of the closing mobile home park, payment of a lump sum based upon consideration of the value of the mobile home, including resident improvements (e.g., landscaping, porches, carports), any increase in mortgage obligations of the resident on the mobile home, and the costs of purchasing a mobile home on site in a comparable park or acquiring other comparable replacement housing.

g. The park owner shall make the monetary payments contemplated in this subsection in a reasonable period of time (to be set by the city council) in advance of the actual relocation of a resident or homeowner.

The city council shall take action on the application within eighty days of the planning commission’s recommendation.

2. Mitigation Measures. The city council may impose reasonable measures not exceeding the reasonable costs of relocation to mitigate the adverse impacts of the change of use on eligible mobile home residents pursuant to subsections D and G of this section.

3. Statute of Limitations. The decision of the city council is final. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6, the statute of limitations for bringing a judicial challenge to any decision concerning a change of use of mobile home park is ninety days. Notice of the city’s decision to the applicant, park owner and affected residents shall include notice that the ninety-day statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 applies.

F. Extension of Time Periods. Time periods in this section may be extended as necessary to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or the California Coastal Act.

10. “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission or its successor agency.

11. “Personal wireless services” has the same meaning as provided in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as “commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services.”

12. “Section 6409(a)” means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as may be amended.

Section 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that “[f]or towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.”

16. “Stealth facility” is any facility designed to blend into the surrounding environment, and is visually unobtrusive. Examples of stealth facilities may include architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, facade-mounted antennas painted and treated as architectural elements to blend with the existing building, or elements designed to appear as vegetation or trees. Also referred to as concealed communications facilities.

17. “Substantial change” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location. For clarity, the definition in this chapter organizes and paraphrases the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location. The definition of substantial change contained in this section shall be interpreted and applied so as to be consistent with 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended) and the applicable FCC decisions, rules and orders and court rulings relating to the same. In the event of any conflict between the definition of substantial change contained in this section and the definition contained in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended), 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7) (as may be amended) shall govern and control.

i. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or

iii. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or

iv. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

b. For towers in the public right-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

i. The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet; or

iii. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or

iv. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure; or

v. The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any ground cabinets that are more than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; or

vi. The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

c. In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

i. The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the community development director; or

ii. The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided, however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets, or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

d. Interpretation of Thresholds.

i. The thresholds for a substantial change described above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur.

ii. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012 – the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

3. Tier 4 Facilities. Planning commission decisions on a conditional use permit for a Tier 4 facility may be appealed to the city council in accordance with Chapter 17.152 (Appeals).

N. Permit Revocation.

1. Basis for Revocation. The city may revoke a permit for a wireless communications facility for noncompliance with any enforceable permit, permit condition, or law applicable to the facility.

2. Revocation Procedures.

a. When the community development director finds reason to believe that grounds for permit revocation exist, the director shall send written notice to the permit holder that states the nature of the violation or noncompliance and a means to correct the violation or noncompliance. The permit holder shall have a reasonable time from the date of the notice (not to exceed sixty calendar days from the date of the notice or a lesser period if warranted by a public emergency) to correct the violation or cure the noncompliance, or show that the violation has not occurred or the facility is in full compliance.

b. If, after receipt of the notice and opportunity to cure described in subsection (N)(2)(a) of this section, the permit holder does not correct the violation or cure the noncompliance (or demonstrate full compliance), the community development director may schedule a public hearing before the planning commission at which the planning commission may modify or revoke the permit.

c. For permits issued by the community development director, the community development director may revoke the permit without such public hearing. The community development director decision to revoke may be appealed to the planning commission.

B. Tier 1 Facilities. In addition to the applicable conditions in subsection A of this section (All Facilities), all Tier 1 facilities shall comply with and all Section 6409(a) permits shall include the following standard conditions of approval:

1. No Permit Term Extension. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) permit constitutes a federally mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. The city’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) permit will not extend the permit term for any conditional use permit, minor use permit, administrative permit or other underlying regulatory approval and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the subject tower or base station. If requested in writing by the applicant at the time of application submittal, the permit term for the underlying conditional use permit, minor use permit, administrative permit or other underlying regulatory approval may be administratively extended by the community development director (at his/her discretion) from the initial approval date upon verification that the facility continues to comply with this chapter and conditions of approval under which the facility was originally approved.

2. No Waiver of Standing. The approval of a Section 6409(a) permit (either by express approval or grant by operation of law) does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a), or any eligible facilities request. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

(Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.120.070 Design review criteria. Revised 6/18
When considering design permit applications, the city shall evaluate applications to ensure that they satisfy the following criteria, comply with the development standards of the zoning district, conform to policies of the general plan and any applicable specific plan, and are consistent with any other policies or guidelines the city council may adopt for this purpose. To obtain design permit approval, projects must satisfy these criteria to the extent they apply.

A. Community Character. The overall project design including site plan, height, massing, architectural style, materials, and landscaping contribute to Capitola’s unique coastal village character and distinctive sense of place.

B. Neighborhood Compatibility. The project is designed to respect and complement adjacent properties. The project height, massing, and intensity is compatible with the scale of nearby buildings. The project design incorporates measures to minimize traffic, parking, noise, and odor impacts on nearby residential properties.

C. Historic Character. Renovations and additions respect and preserve existing historic structure. New structures and additions to nonhistoric structures reflect and complement the historic character of nearby properties and the community at large.

D. Sustainability. The project supports natural resource protection and environmental sustainability through features such as on-site renewable energy generation, passive solar design, enhanced energy efficiency, water conservation measures, and other green building techniques.

E. Pedestrian Environment. The primary entrances are oriented towards and visible from the street to support an active public realm and an inviting pedestrian environment.

F. Privacy. The orientation and location of buildings, entrances, windows, doors, decks, and other building features minimizes privacy impacts on adjacent properties and provides adequate privacy for project occupants.

G. Safety. The project promotes public safety and minimizes opportunities for crime through design features such as property access controls (e.g., placement of entrances, fences), increased visibility and features that promote a sense of ownership of outdoor space.

H. Massing and Scale. The massing and scale of buildings complement and respect neighboring structures and correspond to the scale of the human form. Large volumes are divided into small components through varying wall planes, heights, and setbacks. Building placement and massing avoids impacts to public views and solar access.

I. Architectural Style. Buildings feature an architectural style that is compatible with the surrounding built and natural environment, is an authentic implementation of appropriate established architectural styles, and reflects Capitola’s unique coastal village character.

J. Articulation and Visual Interest. Building facades are well articulated to add visual interest, distinctiveness, and human scale. Building elements such as roofs, doors, windows, and porches are part of an integrated design and relate to the human scale. Architectural details such as trim, eaves, window boxes, and brackets contribute to the visual interest of the building.

K. Materials. Building facades include a mix of natural, high quality, and durable materials that are appropriate to the architectural style, enhance building articulation, and are compatible with surrounding development.

L. Parking and Access. Parking areas are located and designed to minimize visual impacts and maintain Capitola’s distinctive neighborhoods and pedestrian-friendly environment. Safe and convenient connections are provided for pedestrians and bicyclists.

M. Landscaping. Landscaping is an integral part of the overall project design, is appropriate to the site and structures, and enhances the surrounding area.

N. Drainage. The site plan is designed to maximize efficiency of on-site drainage with runoff directed towards permeable surface areas and engineered retention.

O. Open Space and Public Places. Single-family dwellings feature inviting front yards that enhance Capitola’s distinctive neighborhoods. Multifamily residential projects include public and private open space that is attractive, accessible, and functional. Nonresidential development provides semi-public outdoor spaces, such as plazas and courtyards, which help support pedestrian activity within an active and engaging public realm.

P. Signs. The number, location, size, and design of signs complement the project design and are compatible with the surrounding context.

Q. Lighting. Exterior lighting is an integral part of the project design with light fixtures designed, located, and positioned to minimize illumination of the sky and adjacent properties.

R. Accessory Structures. The design of detached garages, sheds, fences, walls, and other accessory structures relates to the primary structure and is compatible with adjacent properties.

S. Mechanical Equipment, Trash Receptacles, and Utilities. Mechanical equipment, trash receptacles, and utilities are contained within architectural enclosures or fencing, sited in unobtrusive locations, and/or screened by landscaping. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.124.010 Purpose. Revised 6/18
This chapter describes the process to obtain use permits, which include conditional use permits, minor use permits, master use permits, and tenant use permits. A use permit is required for land uses that are generally appropriate within a zoning district, but potentially undesirable on a particular parcel or in large numbers. A use permit is a discretionary action that enables the city to ensure that a proposed use is consistent with the general plan and will not create negative impacts to adjacent properties or the general public. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.124.020 When required. Revised 6/18
A. Land uses that require a conditional use permit or a minor use permit are shown in the land use regulation tables for each zoning district found in Part 2 of this title (Zoning Districts and Overlay Zones).

B. Land uses eligible for a master use permit or a tenant use permit are described in Section 17.124.100 (Master use and tenant use permits). (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.124.100 Master use and tenant use permits. Revised 6/18
A. Purpose. A master use permit is a type of conditional use permit that identifies permitted land uses within a commercial property occupied by multiple tenants. Tenant use permits are issued by the community development director for individual tenants that comply with a master use permit.

B. Master Use Permit Eligibility. To be eligible for a master use permit, a property must:

1. Contain more than ten thousand square feet of floor area on a single parcel or on multiple adjoining parcels under one ownership;

2. Conform to all applicable parking and landscaping requirements; and

3. Contain leasable space for two or more tenants.

C. Permitting Process and Restrictions. The process to review and approve a master use permit is the same as for a conditional use permit, except as follows:

1. When approving a master use permit, the planning commission shall specify the uses allowed on the property. Allowed uses are limited to uses permitted or conditionally permitted in the applicable zoning district.

2. The planning commission may establish a maximum size for an individual tenant and/or use.

3. A change of tenant larger than twelve thousand square feet in a property with a master use permit requires planning commission approval of an amendment to the existing master use permit. A change in tenant larger than twelve thousand square feet may not be approved with a tenant use permit.

4. The planning commission may deny a master use permit upon finding that particular circumstances of the property, including an existing or proposed use, require a standard conditional use permit process to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

D. Tenant Use Permits.

1. A land use proposed within a property subject to a master use permit may be established with a tenant use permit, except for tenants twelve thousand square feet or more as described in subsection (C)(3) of this section.

2. Tenant use permits are approved by the community development director. The director shall approve a tenant use permit if the proposed use is consistent with the conditions of the master use permit and the requirements of this section.

E. Tenant Notification. Prior to leasing space on a property with a master use permit, the permit holder shall inform the prospective tenant of the conditions of approval attached to the master use permit and the requirements of this section. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.010 Purpose. Revised 6/18
This chapter identifies the process to obtain a variance. A variance is a discretionary permit that allows for deviation from physical development standards in the zoning code. The city may grant a variance only when the strict application of development standards creates a unique hardship due to unusual circumstances associated with the property. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.020 When allowed. Revised 6/18
A. Allowable Variances. The city may grant a variance to allow for deviation from any physical development standard that applies to the subject property. Examples of physical development standards include height, setbacks, open space, floor area ratio (FAR), and off-street parking requirements.

B. Variances Not Allowed. A variance may not be granted to:

1. Permit a use other than a use permitted in the zoning district as specified in Part 2 of this title (Zoning Districts and Overlay Zones).

2. Reduce the minimum lot size for single-family dwellings or minimum site area per dwelling unit requirements for multifamily developments.

3. Reduce the protection of an environmentally sensitive habitat area except as specifically provided in Chapter 17.64 (Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas).

4. Allow deviation from a requirement of the general plan. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.060 Findings for approval. Revised 6/18
To approve a variance application, the planning commission shall make all of the following findings:

A. There are unique circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, that do not generally apply to other properties in the vicinity or in the same zone as the subject property.

B. The strict application of the zoning code requirements would deprive the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity or in the same zone as the subject property.

C. The variance is necessary to preserve a substantial property right possessed by other property in the vicinity or in the same zone as the subject property.

D. The variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity or in the same zone as the subject property.

E. The variance does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity or in the same zone as the subject property. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.070 Conditions of approval. Revised 6/18
The planning commission may attach conditions of approval to a variance to achieve consistency with the general plan, local coastal program, zoning code, and any applicable specific plan or area plan adopted by the city council. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.080 Precedent. Revised 6/18
The approval of a variance shall not set the precedent for the granting of any future variance. Each application shall be considered only on its individual merits. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.128.090 Appeals and post-decision procedures. Revised 6/18

This chapter establishes a procedure for requesting reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. A reasonable accommodation is typically an adjustment to physical design standards to accommodate the placement of wheelchair ramps or other exterior modifications to a dwelling in response to the needs of a disabled resident. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.140.020 When allowed. Revised 6/18
A. Eligible Applicants. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative, or any entity, when the application of the zoning code or other land use regulations, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.

B. Definition. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having this type of impairment, or anyone who has a record of this type of impairment.

C. Eligible Request. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.140.030 Review authority. Revised 6/18

B. Other Review Authority. If a reasonable accommodation application is submitted concurrently with a permit application reviewed by the planning commission or city council, the reasonable accommodation application shall be reviewed by the planning commission or city council.

C. Referral to Planning Commission. The community development director may refer any reasonable accommodation application to the planning commission for review and final decision. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.140.040 Public notice of process availability. Revised 6/18
Notice of the availability of the reasonable accommodation process shall be publicly displayed at City Hall. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public at the community development department at City Hall. (Ord. 1017 § 2 (Exh. A) (part), 2018)

17.140.050 Application requirements. Revised 6/18
A. Application. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted on an application form provided by the community development department along with any fees required by the planning fee schedule.

B. Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval (e.g., conditional use permit, design review), then the applicant shall file the reasonable accommodation application materials together for concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.

18.02.010 Findings.
In enacting this chapter of the Capitola Municipal Code pertaining to the provision of affordable housing in the city of Capitola, the city council finds:

A. A decent home and suitable living environment for all Capitola residents and workers is a priority of the highest order. To this end, the housing element of the Capitola general plan discusses and analyzes the need to provide housing for senior citizens, disabled persons, single parent families, homeless persons and homeless families, and families of very low, low and moderate income levels. Similarly, the general plan housing element outlines the extremely high cost of housing both regionally and within the city. With respect to affordable housing in the city, the housing element articulates, among others, Policies 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 intended to advance the general plan goal to “Encourage New Affordable Housing Opportunities Through Construction Of New Units.” These policies encourage the adoption of an inclusionary housing ordinance, which provides for construction of affordable housing units in connection with private market rate residential development or the payment of in lieu affordable housing fees in connection with market rate residential development, and further encourage the establishment of a housing trust fund to be used to facilitate the development of new affordable housing in the city.

B. In addition, state law including but not limited to the California Redevelopment Law and State Housing Law, articulate policies and goals, and impose legal obligations upon California cities, counties and redevelopment agencies, relative to the creation and provision of affordable housing by communities throughout the state, including the city of Capitola. Accordingly, a paramount goal of the city and the redevelopment agency is to provide and to create a regulatory environment conducive to the development of both rental and for-sale housing available to all economic sectors of the community with priority given to very low, low and moderate income households currently residing or working within the city.

C. There is currently an inadequate supply of housing in the city which is affordable to very low, low and moderate income households. Federal and state financial assistance and subsidy programs are not sufficient in themselves to close the gap between the cost of most housing in the city and the ability of very low, low and moderate income households to pay those housing costs.

D. The city, given current zoning regulations and very limited vacant residentially zoned property, is nearly “built out” for purposes of future residential development within the city. The inventory of land available for residential development in the city is at a premium and the inventory of land which can be used for the development of housing for very low, low and moderate income households becomes even more depleted with the development and/or improvement of each market rate housing unit in the city. Accordingly, housing opportunities for very low, low and moderate income households are diminished incrementally with the development of each new market rate housing unit which is constructed, rebuilt or substantially improved in the city. Single-family homes which are re-built, and residential remodel/additions which increase square footage more than fifty percent, affect the supply of affordable housing in the city when new, larger units replace older, smaller units. Many of the replaced older units were rentals, or were more accessible to be purchased by moderate income households.

E. According to published Multiple Listing Service home sales price statistics, over the last nine years, from 1996 to July 2004 the median countywide price of a for-sale single-family house has increased from two hundred forty thousand three hundred and fifty dollars to six hundred thirty five thousand dollars. The median countywide price for a for-sale townhouse/condominium has increased from one hundred sixty-four thousand five hundred dollars to four hundred twenty five thousand dollars over the same period. According to the Capitola’s adopted housing element, in 2004 the maximum affordable sales price for a moderate income, three-person household was two hundred fifty two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. The maximum affordable sales price for a moderate income, four-person household was two hundred eighty thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. These figures demonstrate that the “affordability gap” herein referenced has increased incrementally over this nine-year period, thereby rendering affordable housing programs/subsidies currently in place increasingly ineffective in achieving their objectives to house very low, low and moderate income households in the city.

F. If very low, low and moderate income workers cannot find housing in the city, employers will have difficulty in securing a labor force and employees will be forced to commute. Automobile commuting increases air pollution, unnecessarily creates traffic congestion and develops a population which is separate and distinct from full-time residents, thereby resulting in diverse and often contrasting demands on limited city resources.

G. Residential housing projects which contribute to the city’s very low, low and moderate income housing stock serve to augment the city’s housing mix, increase the supply of housing for all economic sectors of the community and thereby assist in providing for a balanced community which is deemed to be in the public interest.

H. Increasing the supply of housing affordable to very low, low and moderate income families through the assistance and cooperation of private residential developers can be achieved only if the provision of such housing by private residential developers becomes more feasible. It is therefore necessary to provide flexibility in the manner and method by which private residential development contributes its fair share to the city’s affordable housing stock.

I. Affordable housing is best integrated into the community when that housing is distributed throughout all areas of the city rather than concentrated in a single area.

J. Therefore in order to advance and achieve the affordable housing goals and policies of the city, redevelopment agency and state referenced in this section, adoption of the affordable housing regulations prescribed in this chapter is necessary and will serve to advance and protect the general health and welfare of the city’s residents, workers and economy. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

(Ord. 891 § 3, 2005; Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.060 For-sale housing units – Sales price and procedures.
When an affordable housing unit is sold or re-sold, the following requirements shall apply:

A. In calculating the maximum allowable sales price for housing units which, pursuant to this chapter, are deed restricted as affordable to very low, low or moderate income households, the city or the city’s designee shall employ the following formula:

1. Single-Family Residences. Sales prices shall be set to equal the price affordable to a household earning the area median income adjusted for household size, with a household size equal to the number of bedrooms in the unit plus one, and a housing cost ratio equal to thirty-five percent of gross monthly household income, and a ten percent downpayment.

2. Condominiums/Townhouses. Sales prices shall be set to equal the price affordable to median income household earning the area median income adjusted for household size, where household size is equal to the number of bedrooms in the unit plus one, and a housing cost ratio equal to thirty-five percent of gross monthly household income, and a ten percent downpayment.

3. Mobile Home Parcels. No sale or resale price will be set for the inclusionary parcels created. Inclusionary parcels in a mobile home park will have initial and subsequent resales restricted to sale to a median income household adjusted by household size.

B. The re-sale purchase price of any affordable unit may be increased by the value of any substantial structural or permanent fixed improvements, which cannot be removed without substantial damage to the premises or substantial or total loss of value of the improvements. The value shall be determined by an appraiser designated by the city. Such adjustment cannot increase the resale price herewith allowed by more than ten percent. No improvements shall be deemed substantial unless the aggregate, actual, initial costs of the improvements to the owner exceed one percent of the purchase price paid by the selling owner for the premises.

C. If the city finds that the owner, through neglect, abuse or lack of adequate maintenance, has damaged an affordable unit, the city may require repairs be made at the owner’s expense and be financed prior to sale or through the escrow account.

D. In cases where the owner or housing developer has made a good faith effort to sell an affordable housing unit at the allowable sales price established by the city, and has failed to sell that unit, the seller may request to make a monetary contribution to the affordable housing trust fund in exchange for the city’s agreement to release the affordability deed restriction on that unit. The amount of the contribution would be determined by the city council, taking into consideration the then-current cost of developing similar affordable housing units and the remaining amount of time the subject unit was deed restricted for sale to very low, low or moderate income households. The city council in its sole discretion may grant, conditionally grant or deny the request. If the request is granted or conditionally granted, upon the city’s receipt of the prescribed housing trust fund contribution, the subject affordable housing deed restriction shall be released and the seller shall be allowed to sell, rent or otherwise use the subject housing unit for residential purposes as the seller deems appropriate.

For purposes of this section, a good faith effort to sell a deed restricted affordable unit will, at a minimum, include listing the property in the pertinent multiple listing service for a minimum of two hundred forty days, actively marketing and showing the property in a manner that would be deemed professionally prudent by a full-time real estate agent or broker employed in the Santa Cruz County housing market. (Ord. 922 § 1, 2007; Ord. 891 § 4, 2005: Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.070 Eligibility for affordable housing units.
A. Only households which qualify as very low, low, median or moderate income households, and who meet the asset limit, shall be eligible to purchase affordable units developed or funded in compliance with, or pursuant to, this chapter.

B. To be eligible to purchase affordable units created pursuant to this chapter, the total assets of a household shall be less than one and one-half times the annual household income limit for that unit. Assets to be used to purchase the affordable unit are excluded from the asset calculation.

C. Income eligibility to purchase affordable units created pursuant to this chapter shall be determined at the time of sale of the affordable unit by the city or the city’s designee.

D. Applicants may appeal the city’s income and asset eligibility determinations within thirty days of the date of their income eligibility letter. Appeals of the city’s income and asset eligibility determinations shall first be made to a committee comprised of the city manager, mayor, community development director, and city attorney. Appeals shall be in the form of a letter addressed to the city manager, and should document the reason the applicant believes an exception should be made. Appeals may be granted by the committee upon a finding, based upon documentary evidence produced by the appellant which clearly demonstrates that the subject household’s future earning capacity will be significantly impaired in the immediately foreseeable future. The committee’s decision may be appealed as set forth in Section 18.02.150.

E. The purchaser of an affordable ownership unit shall occupy the unit as his or her primary place of residence. If the unit ceases to function as a primary residence, it shall be sold according to the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 982 § 1, 2013: Ord. 922 § 1, 2007; Ord. 891 § 5, 2005: Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 2004)

18.02.080 Marketing of affordable units for sale.
A. Any marketing communication advertising an affordable unit for sale shall fully disclose the affordable housing sale price and eligibility restrictions contained in this chapter.

B. Marketing of an affordable ownership unit shall be performed by the owner or owner’s agent, with preference given to households who live or work in Capitola, who shall market the affordable unit for no more than the maximum sale price established by the city (excluding closing costs in sales transactions).

C. The purchaser of an affordable unit shall not pay more in closing costs than that which is reasonable and customary in Santa Cruz County.

D. The seller of an affordable unit shall pay any real estate sales commission associated with the sales transaction.

E. The owner of an affordable unit shall not use the unit as collateral for an amount exceeding ninety-five percent of the maximum sales price allowed by this chapter unless specifically allowed in writing beforehand by the city. All second mortgages shall require the prior written approval of the city. (Ord. 891 § 6, 2005; Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.090 Secondary dwelling units – Non-applicability.
This chapter shall not apply to secondary dwelling units developed pursuant to Capitola Municipal Code Chapter 17.99. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.100 Pre-approved projects – Non-applicability.
This chapter shall not apply to projects for which a development permit was issued by the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or to the projects for which an approved tentative map or vesting tentative map existed as of the effective date of said ordinance. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.110 Fees.
Upon resale or refinance of an affordable unit, the owner or landlord shall pay a fee to the city to cover the city’s costs in determining the maximum sales price and any other monitoring and document preparation processes as may be required of the city. The fee shall be established by city council resolution and shall be calculated so as to allow the city to recover the staff costs and administrative overhead incurred by the city in providing these services and preparing these documents. In addition, the city may similarly charge each prospective purchaser of an existing affordable unit a fee for determining eligibility. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.120 Default/foreclosure.
A. Option to Purchase. In the event a default notice is recorded against an affordable unit, the city or its designee shall have the option to purchase the unit by paying the minimum amount that the owner would have received on the date of the foreclosure sale. Out of this sum, any lien holders shall be paid the amount of funds due them and the owner shall be paid the remaining balance.

B. In the event the city or its designee does not exercise its option to purchase the affordable unit prior to the trustee’s sale or judicial foreclosure and the owner does not redeem the property by curing the default prior to sale or foreclosure, the unit shall thereafter be free from the restrictions of this chapter and the new owner may occupy, sell or rent the unit without restriction.

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, single-family units that have never been sold to individual owner-occupants and multiple-family dwelling units shall not be released from the restrictions of this chapter through a trustee’s sale or judicial foreclosure. In addition, affordable units shall not be released under the following circumstances:

1. The city has not been provided a copy of the notice of default within ten days of its service upon the owner;

2. The owner does not allow the city to exercise its option to purchase; or

3. A lender has over-encumbered the property and refuses to release its interest in the property for the maximum allowable sales price. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.02.130 Conflicts of interest.
The following individuals are ineligible to purchase an affordable unit as their residence:

A. The city manager, city attorney, community development director and members of the planning commission and city council;

B. The owner or developer of an affordable housing project or affordable unit; and

C. The immediate relatives of persons identified in subsections A and B of this section. (Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

E. Wilfully and knowingly make a false statement or representation, or knowingly fail to disclose a material fact for the purpose of qualifying as eligible to purchase or rent an affordable unit under this chapter; or

F. Violate any other provision of this chapter. The city may prosecute any violation of this chapter criminally, civilly or administratively in accordance with Title 4 of this code. (Ord. 891 § 7, 2005; Ord. 879 § 3, 2004)

18.03.010 Applicability.
The regulations set forth in this chapter apply in all RM (multiresidential) districts and in all CC, CR, CN and PO (commercial) districts. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.020 Purpose.
The residential density bonus provisions of this chapter are intended to provide incentives for the production of housing for very low, lower income, and moderate income or senior households in accordance with Sections 65915 and 65917 of the California Government Code. In enacting this chapter, it is the intent of the city of Capitola to facilitate the development of affordable housing and to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the city’s housing element. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.030 Density bonus.
A separate application by an applicant for a residential development project of five or more units, including such residential development projects that include as a component of the development a land donation or construction of a child care facility, or a senior citizen housing development as defined in California Civil Code Section 51.3, is eligible for a density bonus consistent with the requirements of California Government Code Section 65915. An applicant for a density bonus may also request concessions, incentives, reductions, or waivers consistent with the requirements of Sections 65915(d) and 65915(e).

The applicant may request a lesser density bonus than that which is available to the project under Section 65915; however, the city shall not be required to similarly reduce the number or type of units required to be provided pursuant to Sections 65915(b), 65915(c), and 65915(f). In calculating the density bonus for a project, each project shall be entitled to only one density bonus as provided in Section 65915(b)(2), and density bonuses from more than one category may not be combined. When calculating the number of required affordable units to qualify a project for a density bonus, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next larger integer. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.040 California Coastal Act.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede or in any way alter or lessen the effect or application of the California Coastal Act (Division 20 (commencing with Section 3000) of the Public Resources Code). (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.050 Concession or incentive.
For purposes of this section, a concession or incentive shall mean a regulatory concession or incentive as defined in Section 65915(k) and as permitted by Section 65915(d). Developers requesting concessions and incentives shall submit a pro forma that demonstrates to the city that the requested concession or incentive results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions to the project as required by Section 65915(k) and that the incentive or concession is required to provide for affordable housing costs. Nothing in this section requires the provision of direct financial incentives for the residential development project, including but not limited to, the provision of financial subsidies, publicly owned land, fee waivers, or waiver of dedication requirements. The city at its sole discretion may choose to provide such direct financial incentives. Any such incentives may require payment of prevailing wages by the residential development project if required by state law. All concessions or incentives shall require the approval of the planning commission. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.060 Waiver or reduction.
For purposes of this section, a waiver or reduction shall mean a change to a development standard that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development with any density bonus, concessions, or incentives permitted by this section. For purposes of this section, a development standard is as defined in Section 65915(o)(1). (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.070 Parking.
Upon the written request of the developer, for a development project that qualifies for a density bonus, the city shall not require parking ratios that exceed the ratios identified in Section 65915(p)(1). For purposes of this section, on-site parking may be provided through tandem parking or uncovered parking but not on-street parking. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.080 Projects within affordable housing overlay zones.
If the development project is within an affordable housing overlay (AHO) district as defined and implemented in Chapter 17.20 of the Municipal Code, the city may grant a density bonus greater than allowed by this section, if the applicant meets the AHO standards. A residential development project may utilize the AHO as an alternative to the use of state density bonus or may choose to utilize a state density bonus permitted by Section 65915 but may not utilize both the AHO and state density bonuses. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.090 Application.
An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this section shall be submitted in conjunction with the first application for the development project and shall be processed concurrently with all other applications required for the project by the Capitola Municipal Code. The cost of reviewing any required data submitted as part of the application in support of a request for a concession or incentive, including but not limited to the cost to the city of hiring a consultant to review said data, shall be borne by the applicant. The application shall be submitted on a form provided by the city and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:

A. A site plan showing the total number of units, the number and location of the affordable or senior units qualifying the project for a density bonus, and the number and location of the proposed density bonus units;

B. The level of affordability of any proposed affordable units and their conformance with Section 65915(c);

C. A description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers, or reductions of development standards, or modified parking standards. An application for an incentive or concession shall also include a pro forma demonstrating to the city that the requested concession or incentive results in an identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reduction. Where the applicant is requesting the reduction or waiver of a development standard, the applicant shall submit evidence demonstrating that the application of the development standard would physically preclude construction of the project at the densities or with the concessions or incentives that the project is entitled to under this section.

D. If a density bonus is requested for a land donation pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(g), the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that the requirements of Section 65915(g) have been met, thus entitling the project to the requested density bonus.

E. If a density bonus is requested for construction of a child care facility pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(h), the application shall show the location and square footage of the proposed facility and provide evidence that the requirements of Section 65915(h) have been met, thus entitling the project to the requested density bonus. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

18.03.100 Findings for approval of density bonus, concessions, incentives, waivers, or reductions.
A. Before approving a request for a density bonus, incentive, concession, parking reduction, or waiver, the review authority shall make the following findings, as applicable:

1. The residential development project is eligible for a density bonus and for any concessions, incentives, waivers, or parking reductions requested; conforms to all standards for affordability required by Section 65915(c); and includes a financing mechanism for all implementation and monitoring costs.

2. Any requested incentive or concession will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions based upon appropriate financial analysis and documentation required by this section.

3. If the density bonus is based all or in part on dedication of land, all of the requirements included in Section 65915(g) have been met.

4. If the density bonus, incentive, or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a child care facility, all of the requirements included in Section 65915(h) have been met.

5. If the incentive or concession includes mixed uses, all of the findings included in Section 65915(k)(2) can be made.

6. If a waiver or reduction of a development standard is requested, the development standard would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the development project at the density or with the incentives or concessions permitted by Section 65915.

B. The review authority may deny a request for an incentive or concession for which the findings set forth in subsection A of this section can be made only if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of one of the following:

1. The incentive or concession is not required to provide for affordable rents or affordable ownership costs, as provided in Section 65915(d)(1)(A); or

2. The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact upon public health or safety, or the physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low, very low and moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions, as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete; or

3. The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.

C. The review authority may deny a request for a waiver or reduction for which the findings set forth in subsection A of this section can be made only if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of one of the following:

1. The modification would have a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low, very low and moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete; or

2. The modification would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources; or

3. The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state or federal law.

D. The review authority may deny a density bonus, incentive, or concession that is based on the provision of child care facilities and for which the required findings can be made only if it makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, that the city already has adequate child care facilities. (Ord. 938 § 1, 2009)

*    Section 65915 applies only to proposed developments of five or more units.

**    Section 65915(f) defines a “density bonus” as “a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of the application by the applicant to the city.” Section 65915(o)(2) defines “maximum allowable residential density” as “the density allowed under the zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan, or, if a range of density is permitted, means the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning range and land use element of the general plan applicable to the project. Where the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the density allowed under the land use element of the general plan, the general plan density shall prevail.”

***    A concession or incentive may be requested only if an application is also made for a density bonus, pursuant to Sections 65915(a) and 65915(d)(1). Concessions or incentives may be selected from only one category (very low, low, or moderate). No concessions or incentives are available for land donation or senior housing. Day care centers may have one concession or a density bonus, at the city’s option, but not both.

****    Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1351, a “common interest development” means a community apartment project, a condominium project, a planned development, and a stock cooperative.
