Officers are authorized to take such action as may be reasonably necessary to abate nuisances within the city of Clarksville. For the specific nuisances that are defined in 5. 16. 03, Code Enforcement Officers may use the associated method of abatement which is deemed to be both a reasonable and necessary response by the 
city to abate a nuisance. (Ord. No. 2015-737, Sec. 4.2) 
5 16 03 Remedies for specific nuisances 
A. 	Uncut weeds grass and unsani articles All property owners and occupants 
within the municipal boundaries of the city of Clarksville are required to cut 
weeds and grass, remove garbage, rubbish and other sanitary articles and things from their property and to eliminate, fill up, or remove stagnant pools of water or any other unsanitary thing, place or condition which might become a breeding

inoperable or wrecked motor vehicle, or any parts thereof, may be parked, kept or 
r 
stored within the city is in an approved storage area on property that is properly
R 	zoned and permitted for that purpose.

A dog' s breed shall not be considered in determining whether or not it is declared dangerous" further, no dog shall be declared dangerous if: 
1. 	
The dog was protecting or defending a person within the immediate vicinity from an attack or assault. 

2. 
The person attacked was teasing, tormenting, or abusing the dog or its 


S-49 
offspring.

7.72.01 	Rationale and findings 
A. 	Purpose It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral and general welfare of the citizens of the city of Clarksville, Arkansas, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesseswithinthecityofClarksville, Arkansas. Theprovisionsofthis ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is 
it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution 
of obscene material. 
B. 	Findings and rationale Based on evidence ofthe adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Clarksville 
City Council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporatedinthecasesofCityofLittletonv. Z.J. GiftsD-4, L.L.C. 124 S.Ct. 2219 (June 7, 2004); CityofLosAngeles v. AlamedaBooks, Inc., 535U.S. 425

And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around 
sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to Austin, Texas 1986; 
Indianapolis, Indiana 1984; Garden Grove, California 1991; Houston, Texas 
1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga Tennessee 1999­2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota 1980; Los Angeles, California 1997; Whittier, 
California 1978; Spokane, Washington 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota 1994; 
Littleton, Colorado 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 1986; Dallas, Texas 
1997; Greensboro, North Carolina2003; Amarillo, Texas 1997; New York 
New York Times Square 1994; and Report ofthe Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses ( June 6, 1989, state of Minnesota), the Association of Adult Businesses with Secondary Effects; Legal 
Doctrine, Social Theory and Empirical Evidence, (Alan C. Weinstein and Richard 
McCleary, 2011); Rural Hotspots The case of Adult Businesses, ( Richard 
McCleary, 2008); Do " Offsite" Adult Businesses Have Secondary Effect: Legal Doctrine, Social Theory and Empirical Evidence, (Richard McCleary and Alan C. Weinstein, 2009); Stigma management of male and female customers to a non-
urban adult novelty store ( Kristen Hefley 2006); Survey of Florida Appraisers, 
Effects of Land uses on market values Palm Beach County, Florida, (Duncan and 
Associates, 2008); Survey of Texas Appraisers, Secondary Effects of Sexually 
Oriented Businesses on market value, (Connie B. Coger FAICP and Eric Damian 
Kelly, Ph.D., FAICP, 2008); Survey of Appraisers, Fort Worth and Dallas 
Effects of Land Uses on Surrounding Property Values, City of Fort Worth, Texas Duncan and Associates, 2004). ( Ord. No. 2013-694, Sec. 1.) 
The Clarksville City Council finds: 
A. 	Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
B. 	Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented business, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
106. 2 
S-49 
C. 	Each ofthe foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city of Clarksville, Arkansas, has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city of Clarksville, Arkansas' s rationale for this ordinance, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city of Clarksville, Arkansas's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may 
locate in the city of Clarksville, Arkansas finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably believed to be relevant to said 
secondary effects. ( Ord. No. 2013-694, Sec. 1.)

sewer bill for the remaining eight( 8) months. (Ord. No. 438.) 
B. In the case of commercial customers, the monthly sewer charge shall be 
determined by applying the above schedule to each monthly water bill throughout the year. However, in those cases which, in the opinion of the Clarksville Light And Water Commission, an appreciable portion of a commercial or industrial customer' s water usage does not reach the sewer system, the Commission shall determine the percentage of that customer' s water usage which does reach the 
sanitary sewer, and the above schedule of rates shall apply to that percentage 
only. 
C. 	In the case of industrial customers, the monthly sewer charge shall be determined by the greater of the rate established by the above schedule or a charge computed 
by the following formula: ci=(co)(ci) plus (bo) (bi) plus (so) ( si) where" ci" is 
equal to the charge to industrial customers, where " vo" is equal to the unit cost of 
transportation and treatment of industrial waste chargeable to volume, as shown in 
dollars per thousand gallons; where " vi" is equal to the volume of wastewater 
from industrial customers, expressed in thousand gallons per month, where " vo" 
S-49 
is equal to the unit cost of treatment chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen Demand BOD)expressedindollarsperpound; where " vi" isequaltotheamountofBOD from industrial customers expressed in pounds per month; where" so" is equal to 
the unit cost of treatment( including sludge treatment) chargeable to suspended solids, expressed in dollars per pound; and where" si" is equal to the amount of suspended solids from industrial customers expressed in pound per month. In the 
utilization of such formula, the costs associated with the transportation and 
treatment of industrial waste shall include the unamortized capital costs of 
existing facilities( as represented by the outstanding debt), new facility 
construction costs ( exclusive of funds that do not have to be repair, ( operation 
and maintenance costs( including repair and replacement costs) and any other costs borne by the city, including but not limited to site acquisition, easement

and there shall be no meter minimum. ( Ord. No. 104, Sec. 4.) 
10. 08. 05 Non-payment That all rates or charges, if not paid when due, shall constitute a 
lien upon the premises served by the sewer system and the charges will constitute a line upon the fee title to the land and permanent improvements. Ifany service charge so established is not paid within thirty( 30) days after it is due, the water service to the delinquent premises shall be 
discontinued and the amount of such payment in arrears, together with a penalty of ten percent 10%) and a reasonable attorney' s fee may be recovered by the Clarksville Light and Water Commission in a suit filed in the Chancery Court ofJohnson County in the name of the city in

10. 12. 03 Approving authority 
The public water system( PWS) regulations and the state Plumbing Code are complementary in protecting the consumer from contamination introduced through cross connections. The PWS regulations basically are designed to protect the public water distribution system from contamination, and the Plumbing Code is designed to protect private potable water plumbing from backflows. 
Installation of an approved, properly functioning backflow preventor on the owner's 
service line will be sufficient to protect the public water distribution system from backflow; however,thisarrangementwillnotprotectthe usersofthebuilding'spotable water plumbing where the cross connection occurs. Such a Cross Connection Control Program is called a 
containment system, since any potential damage from a cross connection is contained within the plumbing ofthe facility where it occurs. 
To protect the users within the building itself, each device or plumbing fixture which contains a cross connection must be individually protected by an approved cross connection control device. The state Plumbing Code so requires, and such a program is referred to as an isolation program, since any contamination from a cross connection is isolated to the plumbing 
device where the cross connection occurs. 
The approving authority shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants through the water service connection. The approving authority shall take action as necessary to 
meet the goals of the program. 
158. 1 
S-27 
A. 	If in the judgment of the approving authority an approved backflow prevention assembly isrequired attheowner'swater service connectionforthesafetyofthe public water system, the backflow compliance officer shall give notice in writing 
to the owner. 
B. On new installations, the backflow compliance officer shall provide inspection 
and review ofplans in order to determine ifa backflow prevention assembly shall be required. 
C. 	For property with backflow prevention assemblies existing prior to the adoption of this program, the Approving Authority will perform a review of plans or inspectionofpropertyandinform theownerinwritingofanyretrofitrequired,the method of achieving the retrofit and the time allowed for the retrofit to be made. 
D. 	The Approving Authority shall not allow any cross connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow prevention assembly for which a permit has been issued and which shall be regularly tested to ensure satisfactory operation. 
E. 	The Approving Authority shall inform the owner in writing of any failure to comply. Ifthe owner fails to comply with the necessary correction, the Approving Authority shall inform the owner in writing that the water service to theowner'spropertywill beterminated. Iftheownerinforms theApproving Authority of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the approving authority. 
F. 	Ifthe Approving Authority determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, any water service shall be terminated immediately. 
G. 	The Approving Authority shall allow only certified assembly testing technicians to test backflow prevention assemblies and only certified assembly repair technicians to maintain and to repair backflow prevention assemblies. Installation 
shall be accomplished by personnel licensed to do so by the State Department of 
Health.

10. 12. 05 Retrofit of backflow preventers on domestic and fire service lines 
A. 	Existing cross-connection control devices are not required to be replaced if they 
are not equipped with the necessary test cocks. If any such device is relocated, or requires more than minimal maintenance, the final backflow preventer shall meet 
current requirements. However, the Approving Authority may require replacement of the device ifit determines that the operation or maintenance of 
existing device constitutes a hazard to health. Devices shall be removed when directed by the Approving Authority to facilitate the installation of a required backflow prevention assembly. 
B. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the 
requirements of this program but were approved assemblies for the purposes 
described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly 
maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements, be 
excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Approving Authority is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location or requires more than the minimum maintenance, or when the Approving Authority finds that the operation or maintenance of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the assembly shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly. 
C. 	When installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly is required it shall be installed adjacent to the meter on the owner' s side. Any devices existing at this location shall be removed to facilitate installation of the required backflow 
prevention assembly. (Ord. No. 330, Sec. V.)

owner' s expense. 
B. 	Any backflow prevention assembly which fails a performance test shall be repaired or replaced. Upon completion of the necessary repairs, the owner shall cause the backflow prevention assembly to be retested to insure correct operation. Water service may be discontinued ifan RPZA fails a test and cannot be repaired immediately. Copies of all repair, maintenance, testing, and retesting reports shall be submitted to the Approving Authority. 
C. 	Backflow prevention assemblies will be tested more frequently than specified in Subsection( A) above, in cases where there a history of test failure and the Approving Authority determines that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Owner shall initiate testing and bear the cost of 
the additional tests. ( Ord. No. 330, Sec. IX.) 
10. 12. 09 Temporary use backflow prevention assemblies

ARTICLE 3.   DESIGN 
 
3.1   General  In addition to the specific requirements for improvements and their design, the following general principles shall guide the staff and planning commission in their review of proposed developments and subdivision of land. 
 
3.1.1   Conformance to Existing Plans  The purpose of this portion of the Code is to specify the basic and minimum requirements for lots, blocks, streets, and other physical elements in new subdivisions.  These standards constitute the minimums which are to be observed by developers.  In order that the various purposes of this Code may be accomplished, all subdivisions hereinafter established (1) shall conform with the various elements of the Comprehensive Development Plan including the location of major thoroughfares and streets, the location of parks, playgrounds, schools and other public sites, and appropriate land uses; and (2) shall be designed to conform with the minimum zoning and building regulations for the area in which the proposed subdivision is located. 
 
3.1.2   Suitability of the Land  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, and erosion, and any and deemed by the Planning Commission to be topographically or otherwise unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor shall such land be platted for any other uses as may continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life or property unless steps are taken to diminish the above-mentioned hazards. 
 
3.1.3   Land Set-Aside  Such land within a proposed subdivision not detrimental to the development of the subdivision shall be set aside for uses as shall not be endangered by the conditions set forth in Section 3.1.4. In particular, land within the 100 year flood plain as defined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the appropriate federal agency shall not be platted unless the subdivider shall incorporate such improvements as will render the area substantially safe for development and in accordance with all flood plain regulations. 
 
3.1.4   Design Where Future Resubdivision is Indicated  Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will be eventually resubdivided into small building sites, the Planning Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.  Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat. 
 
3.1.5   Provision of Land for Public Use  The Planning Commission may require reservation of suitable sites for public uses indicated on the Comprehensive Development Plan for a period of up to six (6) months after the filing of a Letter of Intent to Develop by the subdivider.  Such reservations shall be referred to the appropriate public board, commission, or body having jurisdiction or financial responsibility, to permit the opportunity to acquire said sites either through purchase, taking an option, or the filing of condemnation proceedings under the power of eminent domain.  The failure or refusal of any public entity to acquire lands designated as suitable sites for public uses within six (6) months of the filing of a letter of intent to develop by the subdivider shall relieve the subdivider of any responsibility to hold such land for future public purposes. 
 
 3.1.6   Zoning or Other Regulations No Final Plat of land within the force and effect of the Clarksville Zoning Ordinance shall be approved unless it conforms to such ordinance. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code, or other official regulations or ordinance the most restrictive shall apply. The Planning Commission shall grant no waiver to the subdivision regulations that would have the effect of violating any provision of the zoning regulations. 
 
 3.1.7   Adequacy of Public Facilities and Services  Land which is neither provided, nor programmed by the city within the corporate limits to have adequate water, sanitary sewer services or storm drainage facilities shall not be subdivided for purposes which require such services unless the developer provides such services. 
 
 3.1.8   Subdivision and Street Names  The proposed name of subdivision and streets shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any street or subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Planning Commission in consultation with the Johnson County 911 Address Coordinator shall review and have final authority to designate street and subdivision names. 
 
 3.1.9   Access  Every subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street. Every lot or parcel within a subdivision shall have direct access to a public street. 
  
 3.1.10   Location of Streets  All highways and street right-of-ways, and other features of the Master Street Plan, shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and the dimension indicated on the Master Street Plan. 
 
 3.1.11  Low Impact Development  Low Impact Development design practices may be allowed when upon review of the City Engineer, the design of the development shall conform to accepted engineering standards and meet the spirit and intent of these regulations. Any subdivision or development using Low Impact Development design practices shall require a waiver for approval. Amended by Ord.16-758 
 
3.2   Subdivision Design Standards  The quality of design of the urban area is dependent on the quality of design of the individual subdivisions that compose it.  Good community design requires the coordination of the efforts of each subdivider and developer in the urban area.  Therefore, the design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the principles established by the Comprehensive Development Plan for land use, traffic circulation, community facilities, and public utility services, and in accordance with the following design standards. 
 
3.2.1   Streets  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to all of the elements of the Comprehensive Development Plan 
 and shall be designed in accordance with the following provisions: 
   
1)   Local residential streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.  The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no hardship in the subdividing of adjacent properties.  The Planning Commission may require the dedication of street rights-of-way to facilitate the development of adjoining properties. 
 
2)   Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or 
intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.    
 
3)  Proper access in the form of stub streets or temporary dead-end streets shall be provided to adjacent unplatted property unless, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, topographic conditions or similar physical impediments preclude reasonable provision of such access, or alternate routes of access are, or will be available in the future. 
 
4)   Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed 
major street, the Planning Commission may require service streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.  There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the City under conditions approved by the Planning Commission. 
 
5)   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets.  Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider.  The Planning Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries. See Article 4, Section 4.10 for additional regulations on perimeter streets. 
 
6)   The street names shall require the approval of the Planning Commission.  Streets that obviously are in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street. 
 
7)   Design Requirements 
 
A.   Right-of-Way and Pavement  Widths  The right-of-way width shall be the distance across a street from property line to property line.  The minimum street right-of-way width shall conform to the street standards designated within the Master Street Plan. 
 
 Cul-de-sacs or courts designed to have one end closed should be no more than six hundred (600) feet long without special permission of the Fire Chief.  Such streets will be provided at the closed end with a turn-around of not less than one hundred (100) feet roadway diameter (outside to outside of roadway surface). 
 
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements from each side of the center line. In addition, paving and other improvements shall be installed in accordance with the established standards for improvements for that portion of the affected streets. 
 
When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way shall be dedicated. In addition, paving and other improvements shall be installed in accordance with the established standards for improvements for that portion of the affected streets. 
 
B.   Street Grades  The minimum grade for all streets shall be 0.5% unless the developer offers a suitable design for draining the street of surface storm water. 
 
C.   Intersections  The center line of no more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any point.  Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees. 
 
Curb radii at street intersections shall not be less than twenty (20) feet; 
Unless trees or utility poles require less; and where the angle of a street intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater curb radius.  When necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radium without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. 
 
Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be allowed unless special circumstances warrant a waiver as specifically approved by the Planning Commission. 
 
Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create any traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance. 
 
3.2.2   Alleys  Alleys may be allowed at the rear of all platted lots where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Commission of the need for alleys.  The width of an alley shall be not less than twenty (20) feet. 
 
  Where alleys are provided: 
 
1)   Intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided. 
 
2)   Dead-ends shall be avoided. 
 
3.2.3   Easements  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. 
 
Where a subdivision is crossed by a creek, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided conforming substantially with 
the lines of such water course, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.  Parallel streets may be required in connection therewith.  No building or structure may be erected over or in an easement. 
 
3.2.4   Block  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following: 
 
1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs  
of the type of use contemplated. 
 
2)   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions. 
 
3)   Needs for convenient access, circulations, control, and safety 
of street traffic. 
 
4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
 
Blocks of less than three hundred (300) feet in length or more than one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in length are discouraged except as the terrain itself makes blocks of other length desirable.  When a block exceeds six hundred (600) feet in length, the Planning Commission may require a dedicated easement not less than fifteen (15) feet in width and a paved crosswalk not less than four (4) feet in width to provide pedestrian access across the block. 
 
Blocks used for residential purposes should be of sufficient width to allow for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.  Blocks intended for business and industrial use should be of a width suitable for the intended use, with due allowance for off-street parking and loading facilities. 
 
3.2.5   Lots  The shape of residential lots shall not be required to conform to any stated pattern.  The Planning Commission shall judge lot shape on the type of development and on the use to which the lots will be put.  Corner Lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building set back from and orientation at both streets.  The following are lot dimension guidelines: 
  
1)   Lots within the city limits shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Code. 
 
2)   Lots not served by sanitary sewer and/or public water supply shall be of sufficient size to conform to the regulations and specifications of the Arkansas State Health Department. 
 
3)   The minimum building setback line shall conform to the setbacks appropriate to the propertys zoning district unless within the Planning Area. Those developments and subdivisions within the Planning Area shall designate a zoning district appropriate to the property and conform to the setback requirements of that district. 
 
Side Lot lines should be approximately at right angles or radial to street lines.  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where they are needed to 
provide for the separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.  A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet shall be provided along the portion of the lots abutting such a traffic artery or other use where screening is required.  There shall be no right of access across a planting screen easement.  At the discretion of the Planning Commission, the developer may substitute for an easement and a planting screen with a permanent ornamental fence or wall of a height and architectural design which will appropriately  screen and be harmonious with residential or other neighborhood elements; but there shall still be a restriction upon the right of access, and such restriction shall be clearly designated on the plat and Bill of Assurance. 
 
In residential districts which abut railroad rights-of-way, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way.  This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: This strip is reserved for screening.  The placement of structures hereon is prohibited.  Additionally, rear yard setbacks shall not include this area. 
 
The size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial uses should be adequate to provide for off-street parking facilities and services required by the type of use and development contemplated.  When developed within the city limits, they shall conform to the Zoning Code. 
 
Pipe-stem lots are to only be used on rare occasions in order to use otherwise unusable properties and shall require a waiver for approval. Amended by Ord.16-758

4.2   Streets and Street Name Markers  The subdivider of any subdivision designed to be used for residential, commercial, industrial, or other purposes shall lay out, grade, and otherwise improve all streets that are designated on the approved plat or that directly serve the subdivision in accordance with the specifications of the City. The subdivider shall bear the costs to have street name makers installed for the subdivision or development. The design of the markers and signs shall conform to the Citys standards.  Street pavement widths shall conform to the Master Street Plan with the indicated pavement width being measured from back of curb to back of curb: 
 
The subdivider shall bear the cost of paving streets for local and collector level streets. For an arterial street, the subdivider shall receive financial assistance from the City or other public body to pay the pro rata share of the cost of the street width in excess of 36 feet.  All streets shall be constructed utilizing the following specifications: 
 
4.2.1   Asphalt Street Standards  The subsurface grade shall consist of eight (8) inches of compacted gravel.  Gravel base shall consist of a natural or artificial mixture of 
 gravel and soil mortar uniformly well-graded from coarse to fine and so proportioned as  to meet all State Highway Department requirements for Bank Run Gravel or SB-2.   The gravel is to be compacted in keeping with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation  Department Standard Specifications, Section 302.  The surface grade shall consist of two  (2) inches, after rolled, of hot mix or one course of asphaltic concrete. 
 
4.2.2   Concrete Street Standards  Base course or subgrade is to be compacted in keeping with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department Standard 
Specifications, Section 302.  Concrete pavement is to be constructed according to Section 501, Portland Cement Pavement Specifications. 
 
1)   Concrete is to be 3,000 lbs. (psi) compressive strength placed on a thoroughly compacted and graded subgrade. 
 
  2)   Concrete is to be poured in separate lanes (maximum width of fifteen 
(15) feet).  Transverse joints shall be of two (2) inches wide felt strip; one-sixteenth (1/16) to one-quarter (1/4) inch thick at fifteen (15)feet intervals for contraction joints.  The poured surface grade shall have a minimum thickness of six (6) inches of concrete. 
 
3)   Reinforcing tie bars, where required, shall be in general conformance with Portland Cement Association recommendations. 
 
 
4.2.3   Curbs & Gutters  The subdivider shall provide permanent six (6) inch concrete curbs with twenty-four (24) inch integral concrete gutters or standard rolled curbs.

4.3   Water Lines and Fire Hydrants  All subdivisions shall be provided with water supply and distribution systems approved by the City and meeting the requirements of the State Health Department. 
 
The water supply and distribution system shall be designed to provide the anticipated water consumption within the subdivision, including fire protection. Design criteria for water supply shall conform to city standards. 
 
Fire hydrants shall be installed by the subdivider and shall be located in accordance with the State Fire Code and approved by the Fire Chief. 
 
4.4   Sanitary Sewers  All subdivisions shall be provided with an approved sewage collection and treatment system.  Connection with the Citys sanitary sewer system shall be required if the development lies within at least three hundred (300) feet of an existing sewer line that can serve the development by gravity flow. 
 
If a sanitary sewage treatment system or septic tank system is to be installed, the plans for said system shall be approved by the State Department of Health prior to approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission. 
 
The sewage collection system shall be designed to handle the anticipated flow of sewage from within the subdivision, including development of future sections of the same subdivision and adjacent areas within the same drainage basin or pump station service area.  Recognized engineering design criteria meeting the requirements of the State Department of Health and all city standards shall be used to design the system. 
 
4.5   Drainage  All subdivisions shall be provided with a storm drainage system that is designed and constructed to handle rainfall runoff that originates in or traverses the subdivision.  Storm drainage for residential areas, and for shopping centers, industrial areas, and highway commercial areas, storm drainage shall be designed for a twenty-five (25) year rainfall frequency.  The quantity of runoff shall be calculated using the Rational method of computation.  Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes.  The size openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbots formula, but in no case shall the pipe be less than twelve (12) inches.  Cross drains shall be built on a straight line and grade, and shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert.  They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than one foot below the roadbed.  These standards shall apply to the design of outfall structures and facilities. 
 
Street crowns shall not be flattened, or warped from one side of the street to the other for the purpose of causing water to flow from one side of the street to the other.  The storm drainage system shall include curbs and gutters on all streets with drop inlets spaced according to acceptable engineering design principles.  In general, rainfall that cannot be handled in streets 
shall be put into pipe or lined channels, except major outfall channels which handle water from drainage areas beyond the subdivision being constructed. Open drainage channels shall be not be constructed except where curb and gutter requirements are waived.  
 
The developer/subdivider shall pay all costs of the internal drainage system, including the cost of facilities to handle water coming into the subdivision from lands owned by a person other than the developer.  The City may participate in the cost of oversized storm sewer lines (above 60-inch diameter). 
 
4.6   Monuments  Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter (or 4-inch square) and thirty (30) inches in length with one (1) one-half (1/2) inch metal reinforcing rod the length of the monument shall be placed with top flush to the ground at all points of intersection of the boundary of the subdivision and the location of all monuments shall be shown on the final plat. 
 
4.7   Lot Markers  The corners of all lots shall be marked by the placement of a metal reinforcing rod twenty-four (24) inches in length and one-half (1/2) inch in diameter placed with top flush to the ground. 
 
4.8   Sidewalks  Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Clarksville Zoning Code. 
 
4.9   Street Lights  In subdivisions with underground utilities, the developer shall install ornamental street lighting (in contrast to wood or metal poles normally installed). 
 
4.10   Boundary/Perimeter Street Improvements 
 
 4.10.1   Administration The planning commission shall be responsible for requiring improvements in the public right-of-way consistent with these regulations, with regard to subdivisions and all other affected developments. 
 
The City Treasurers office shall be responsible for receiving, recording, depositing, and reporting in-lieu cash contributions as determined by the planning commission. The City Treasurers office shall maintain a boundary street improvement account and shall furnish a yearly report summarizing the account to the Mayor and City Council. This report shall include both the principal and the interest earned for the accounting period. 
 
Subdivisions in residential zones containing six (6) or fewer lots and developments less than two (2) acres and 10,000 square feet in size shall be exempt from the provisions and requirements of Section 4.10, excluding the right-of-way dedication provisions contained in 4.10.3 and 4.10.4. Amended by Ord.16-758 
 
 4.10.2   Improvements Included 
 Amended by Ord.14-720 
When a proposed subdivision abuts an existing public street right of way, the developer will be responsible for installing boundary street improvements as defined by this section. Boundary street improvements shall include the following: 
 
1) Reconstruction of one-half section of the abutting street if the existing street is not up to city standards. 


 
2) Widening of one-half section of the abutting street to city standards. 


 
3) Reconstruction or construction of the entire street section of the street if the existing street is not up to city standards and is located wholly within the proposed subdivision. 


 
4) Curb and gutter for the length of the project boundary that adjoins the street. 


 
5) Standard drainage piping and drainage structures. 


 
6) One hundred (100) percent of bridge and box culvert construction. (Waivers may be granted in the case of arterial streets.) 


 
7) Other standard roadway or drainage improvements required by ordinance or as may be required to conform to accepted engineering principles, as identified by the City Engineer and relayed to the Planning Commission. 


 
 4.10.3   Right-of-way dedication

 4.10.4   Master Street Plan 
Right-of-way dedication and boundary street improvements shall be in accordance with the Master Street Plan adopted for the planning area jurisdiction of the City of Clarksville. 
 
 4.10.5   In-lieu requirements 
In-lieu cash contributions may be allowed solely at the discretion of the city in situations including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
1) The horizontal alignment of the existing street pavement or right-of-way is such that the required minimum radius centerline alignment is not obtainable without participation of adjacent properties being developed. 


 
2) The proposed horizontal centerline alignment of the existing pavement does not coincide with either the existing centerline of the right-of-way, or the land line, the discrepancy being so large as to: 


 
a) Necessitate the construction of more than one-half the street width. 



 
b) Necessitate construction of new curb within the projected edge of the existing pavement. 



 
3) The vertical alignment of the existing pavement is such that: 


 
a) The required safe stopping sight distance is not obtainable without extension of construction past the limits of the project. 



 
b) A reasonably smooth pavement or a properly crowned and shaped cross section is not obtainable within the length and width requirements of the project. 



 
c) Under the constraints of good engineering practice, maximum permissible centerline grades or minimum permissible gutter grades cannot be obtained within the length and width limits of the project. 



 
4) The location of the existing or proposed street in the one-percent floodplain precludes the construction of street and drainage facilities. 


 
5) A subdivision is so located that the presence of a drainageway necessitates construction of a drainage structure which would be unfeasible as half street construction. 


 
6) The state of adjacent land development along the street precludes further acquisition of improvements through plat processes. 


 
7) The length of the property boundary along the right-of-way is less than three hundred (300) linear feet and is not located at an intersection. 


 
8) The Building Official determines that in-lieu cash contributions would be in the best interest of the city. 


 
 4.10.6   In-lieu contributions 
In lieu of constructed improvements, the developer shall contribute to the city a cash payment equal to one hundred (100) percent of the City Engineers estimate of the cost of construction of the required boundary street improvements. Adjustments may be made by the City Engineer where deemed appropriate. In-lieu contributions shall be reimbursed with interest, as determined by the City Treasurers office, when not expended for the specific required improvements within five (5) years from the date of permit approval. Funds will be expended on the same street except that intersecting streets may be included when improvements to such intersecting streets are necessary to provide adequate drainage or traffic flow between the intersecting street and the original street. Such improvements to intersecting streets shall not exceed beyond 100 feet from their intersection with the original street. The City Council must approve all refunds and may, at its discretion, refund proceeds before the five (5) year deadline. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ARTICLE 5.   PROCEDURE 
 
5.1   General  A subdivider proposing to make or have made a subdivision within the territorial jurisdiction shall not proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, including grading, before obtaining preliminary plat approval; nor shall he attempt to record the plat of the subdivision or any part thereof prior to obtaining final plat approval from the Planning Commission, and acceptance of public dedications by the City Council. 
 
5.2   Preliminary Plat  When any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, the subdivider or his agent shall submit to the Planning Commission a letter of intention which may at the option of the subdivider include a preliminary sketch plan.  The subdividers letter shall indicate the location and size of the tract, the proposed time schedule, the date on which the subdivider proposes to submit his preliminary plat for Planning Commission review, and such other information as the subdivider deems important for recognition by the Planning Commission. 
 
If the proposed subdivision is a portion of a tract which is later to be subdivided in its entirety, then a tentative master plan for the entire subdivision shall be submitted with the preliminary plat of the portion first to be subdivided.  The master plan shall conform in all respects to the requirements of the preliminary plat, except that it may be on a scale of not more than 1" = 400', and all dimensions may be scaled. 
 
Upon review of the letter of intention, the Planning Commission may recommend a Pre-Application Conference to be held between the subdivider, a committee of the Planning Commission, and /or the Planning Commissions designated agents for land planning and engineering. 
 
5.2.1   Pre-Application Conference  When a major subdivision of a tract of land within the Planning Commissions jurisdiction is proposed, the subdivider is urged to consult early and informally with the administrative staff of the City and/or designated members of the Planning Commission.  The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing  
existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision 
  
At such meeting, the general character of the development will be discussed and items will be included concerning zoning, utility service, street requirements, and other pertinent factors related to the proposed subdivision. 
 
The purpose of the Pre-Application review is to afford the subdivider an opportunity   to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the Planning Commission in order             to facilitate the subsequent preparation and approval of plans. 
 
A developer may request to have a sketch plat reviewed by the full Planning Commission. Comments and approvals made concerning a sketch plan are not binding on the Planning Commission; however, it is the policy of the City that, having tentatively approved a sketch plat, the Planning Commission shall not unreasonably withhold approval of a preliminary plat that is substantially identical to the sketch plan. 
 
5.2.2   Submission Requirements  The next required step in the process is the submission of an Application for Preliminary Plat Approval.  Requirements of this submission are set out in ARTICLE 6, Section 6.1.  A filing fee as specified in ARTICLE 
9, Section 9.2, shall be paid at time of filing, in the City Clerks office.  Any subdivision proposing street and/or drainage improvements and/or water or sewer improvements shall have the improvements designed by a Registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the State of Arkansas. 
 
An Engineers Cost Estimate of the construction costs of all proposed improvements shall be included with the submission of the Preliminary Plat.  The cost estimate shall contain amounts and unit prices for the various items involved.  Lump sum or unrealistic estimates will not be accepted. 
 
For purposes of preliminary engineering review, the Application and initial submission shall include six (6) complete sets of plans and specifications. 
 
The Preliminary Plat shall clearly depict the phase of development that is to be constructed within the next eighteen (18) months. Approval of the Preliminary Plat shall apply only to those phases of the development that shall be constructed in the next eighteen (18) months. 
 
The Preliminary Plat shall depict all land under contiguous ownership of which the proposed subdivision is a part. If the development depicted appears as a portion of a larger tract to be developed at a later time, the Planning Commission may require a master plan and phasing plan of the entire development. 
 
5.2.3   Preliminary Staff Review  The Citys Engineer, in council with Clarksville Light and Water, Street and Fire Departments, City Inspector, and other designated staff, shall review the documents received for compliance with design standards of the Citys Land Use Plan, Master Street Plan, zoning and subdivision codes, fire protection and utility requirements. Processing of the plat shall cease at this step for any Preliminary Plat that is not consistent with the above. The plat shall be returned to developer and design engineer with all deficiencies or required modifications noted. The developer may then revise the plat to achieve conformity or make a request for an amendment to the offending plan or code.  
 
The developer shall then supply six (6) complete sets of the plans and documents as modified to the City Engineer for his stamp of approval.  The application and supporting plans and documents will be placed on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration at their next regular meeting. 
 
5.2.4   Preliminary Approval  After the Planning Commission has reviewed the preliminary plat and construction plans and engineering report, the applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or additions.  The Planning Commission shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the Preliminary Plat within 45 days from receipt thereof, unless the Applicant is notified in writing by the Commission Chairman that additional time is required.  If disapproved, the preliminary plat shall be returned to the subdivider with a written statement as to the reasons for disapproval. 
 
The Planning Commissions approval of a preliminary plat shall be deemed as an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the installation of streets, water, drainage, sewer, and other required improvements and utilities, the dedication of reservation of public lands, and to the preparation of the final 
plat.  Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the final plat. 
 
When the Planning Commission finds that the preliminary plat, together with the site improvements plan, meets all the requirements of this Code, it shall approve the plat by placing a stamp of Preliminary Plat Approval upon the preliminary plat.  The stamp of Preliminary Plat Approval shall read: This plat has been given preliminary plat approval only, and has not been approved for recording as a public record.  This certificate shall expire on____________________ (date).  Such stamp of approval shall bear the signature of the Chairman of the Planning Commission; and shall be dated. 
 
If approved, the original copy will be filed in the Planning Commissions records in City Hall and one copy in the Mayors office.  Other copies will be distributed to the City Engineer, Clarksville Light and Water, Fire Chief, and one to the subdivider. 
 
A preconstruction conference will be held between the city engineer, city inspector, fire chief, developer, and contractor after the preliminary plat is approved prior to beginning construction or any improvements. 
 
The Planning Commission shall approve a Preliminary Plat upon determining the following: 
 
1) That the plat conforms to all adopted plans, policies, and ordinances of the City of Clarksville. 


 
2) That the plat conforms to the regulations contained in this code. 


 
3) That the developer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission the capacity to undertake the proposed improvements. 


 
4) That the Preliminary Plat will not add a financial burden to the City or its taxpayers. 


 
5) That the proposed development will not result in off-site improvement costs to the City unless confirmed by written agreement between the City and the developer. 


 
6) That all utilities, both public and private, are adequate to handle the demand to be created by the proposed subdivision. 


 
7) That all utility structures and streets within the subdivision are designed in such a manner to permit development of adjacent properties and that agreements are in place for cost-sharing of required oversized utility structures. 


 
5.2.5   Authorization to Proceed  Receipt of an approved or conditionally approved copy of the preliminary plat, together with an approved copy of the improvements plan shall constitute authorization of the Planning Commission for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plan, the installation of improvements, and the staking out of lots and blocks.  The subdivider, after approval of the preliminary plat, shall complete all 
improvements required under this Code. The approved copy of the preliminary plat must contain a signed Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval to be considered valid. 
 
The City Engineer, Inspector, Light & Water or other designated staff may inspect the improvement work at any time to confirm materials used, construction methods employed, and conformance to approved plans and specifications and other applicable standards. 
 
5.2.6   Expiration of Preliminary Plat Approval   A preliminary plat which has been approved and received a signed Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval shall be effective and binding upon the Planning Commission for no more than eighteen (18) months, as shown on the Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval. If installation of all required improvements is not completed by the expiration date of the Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval, the preliminary plat shall be considered null and void unless the subdivider is permitted an extension of approval. 
 
An extension of approval may be granted by the City Engineer or Planning Commission.  
 
1)   An extension of approval granted by the City Engineer shall be conditioned upon the subdivider providing a performance bond in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE 5, Section 5.3.3, paragraph 3) of this code. Such extension of approval shall not extend longer than one month prior to the expiration date of the performance bond. Such performance bonds shall not be issued to have an expiration date of greater than twenty-four (24) months from the date of the City Engineers extension of approval.  
 
2)   An extension of approval granted by the Planning Commission shall not extend more than twelve (12) months and shall not require a performance bond.  
 
Any plat not receiving final plat approval or granted an extension of approval shall be required to resubmit for reapproval as a preliminary plat. Amended by Ord.16-758 
 
5.3   Final Plat  When the requirements of this Code have been satisfied and while the Preliminary Plat Approval is in effect, the subdivider may submit to the Planning Commission an application for review and approval of the final plat. 
 
5.3.1   Submission Requirements  At least twenty-one (21) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit an application which shall consist of: 
 
1)   A letter of application requesting review and approval of the final plat 
  
2)   The final plat in an original tracing or reproducible and four prints, and other     documents as specified in Article 6, Section 6.2. 
 
3)   The Contractor who performs the work shall post a maintenance bond with the city covering any defects in materials and workmanship for the required improvements in the amount of fifty (50) percent of the total cost of those improvements, and stating that any and all defects in materials and workmanship shall be corrected by the contractor by the end of the bond period.  Maintenance 
Bond(s) shall be in full force for not less than one (1) year from date of filing of Final Plat.  Work performed under terms of the Bond shall be approved by the City.  If the contractor is unable to post bond the developer shall post the required bond on behalf of the contractor. 
 
4)   A filing fee as specified in Article 9, Section 9.2. 
 
5.3.2   Approval by Planning Commission  The final plat of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for final approval within eighteen (18) months of the date on which the preliminary plat was approved.  If not submitted for final approval within such time, the preliminary plat shall be considered as having been abandoned, unless the Planning Commission agrees to an extension of time. 
 
If the subdivider requests permission to develop only a portion of the property for which the preliminary plat was approved, the Planning Commission may grant approval of a final plat for said portion alone. 
 
The City Engineer shall review the submission, in council with City Inspector, Street, Fire, and Light and Water department heads, and shall determine compliance of the project with approved plans and applicable standards.  The application, with engineers report, shall be filed with the Planning Commission for consideration at its regular meeting. 
 
The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat within forty-five (45) Days of receipt thereof, or notify the Applicant in writing that additional time is required. Disapproval of the plat shall be reported to the Applicant in writing within ten (10) days after the meeting at which the plat was disapproved. 
 
Upon approval, the original plat and all copies shall be signed, reviewed and distributed in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 5.3.3 and Section 5.3.4 below. 
 
Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any streets or other public ways or grounds, nor does it constitute authority for the plat to be recorded. Amended by Ord.16-758 
 
5.3.3   Acceptance of Public Dedications  Before the Final Plat is recorded in the office of the County Recorder, an agreement shall be reached between the subdivider or his agent and the City Council.  Said agreement shall be with regard to the installation of any street improvements or utility construction called for in the subdivision plat; the dedication and/or reservation of lands for public use; the dedication and acceptance of utilities and public improvements; and other agreements as required in the Planning Commissions approval of the plat.  The Maintenance Bond to cover public improvements shall be on file with the City Council before consideration of acceptance of public dedications. Additionally, before such action, the City Council must receive one of the following: 
  
1)   A certificate of completion from the City Engineer, stating that all required improvements and installations have been made, added, or installed; or 
 
2)   A cash deposit in the full amount as determined by the City, necessary to       complete the improvements and installations in compliance with this Code for the portion of the subdivision for which final plat approval is sought.  Such cash 
deposit may be withdrawn in direct proportion to the amount of work completed as approved by the City; or 
 
3)   An executed agreement with the City which shall: 
 
A.   Be in an amount determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to complete the improvements and installations for the subdivision in compliance with this Code. 
 
B.   Specify the time for the completion of the improvements and installations. 
 
C.   Be accompanied by a performance bond which shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution.  The period of time shall be specified in the resolution approving the final plat and shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not in any event exceed two (2) years from the date of final approval. Amended by Ord.16-758 
  
5.3.4   Recording  Upon approval of the final plat and acceptance of the public dedications by the City Council, the City Clerk shall have the final plat recorded in the office of the Circuit Clerk. The subdivider shall pay all fees in connection with the recording of said plat. 
 
The final plat shall be filed in the office of the Circuit Clerk within ninety (90) days after approval by the Planning Commission; and if not filed within such time, said approval shall be considered as having been abandoned. 
 
Upon recording the plat, the City shall retain the original tracing and one copy for the Planning Commissions files, one copy shall be forwarded to the Tax Assessor and one copy shall be returned to the subdivider. 
 
No building permits may be issued until proof of the recording of the approved final plat has been presented to the City Clerk, giving plat book and page number, or instrument number.

1) Site plans for developments on less than two (2) acres or less than 10,000 square feet in total building footprint size shall be reviewed by the Building Official, City Planner, and City Engineer for compliance with this code and other applicable codes and laws. Approval or denial of such site plans shall be handled by action of the City Engineer. Copies of any approved or denied site plan shall be provided to the Planning Commission along with a report of action taken. Any decision rendered by the City Engineer on a site plan application may be appealed to the Planning Commission. 
 
2) Site plans for developments on more than two (2) acres or greater than 10,000 square feet in total building footprint size shall be reviewed for compliance with this code and other city codes by the Building Official, City Planner, and City Engineer. The Planning Commission shall review the application at the next regularly scheduled meeting after receiving the completed application with all required attachments. The Commission may approve, deny, or conditionally approve the site plan application based upon its conformance with the provisions of this code and other applicable laws and codes. Upon obtaining approval from the Planning Commission, the developer may commence construction after obtaining a building permit and any other required permits. 
 
Approval shall be limited to the type of building/development stated within the letter accompanying the application. Should the developer decide to build or develop on the property in a manner inconsistent with the use as stated in the letter and site plan accompanying the application, the applicant must submit a new application for approval. Should the developer build or develop the property for a use contrary to the use stated in his/her application, the approval previously granted shall become null and void, and the developer shall cease construction/building on the property upon receipt of notice from the Building Official. 
 
Approval shall expire after six (6) months if construction has not commenced, and within two (2) years if construction has not been completed. Site plans for which construction is not completed within two (2) year shall require resubmission as a new application. 
 
8.4   Expansion of Existing Buildings  Expansions of existing buildings shall be reviewed only when they meet one of the following. 
 
1) The expansion increases the size of the building by greater than 1/3 of its original size.  


 
2) The expansion creates the need to change the existing design of the developments access. 


 
3) Changes have occurred to adjacent properties that would require new site analysis of the proposed development. 


 
4) The development proposal, based upon the judgment of the Building Official, represents such a substantial change that full review by the Planning Commission is necessary. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ARTICLE 9.   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 
 
9.1   Enforcement  In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with all other applicable rules, regulations, and laws including, but not limited to: Comprehensive Development Plan, Zoning Code (within the Citys corporate limits), building and housing codes, and any other regulations adopted by the City Council; and any regulations or special requirements of the State Health Department, State Highway and Transportation Department, or other appropriate State agencies.  It shall be the duty of the building Inspector and the Planning Commission to enforce these regulations and to bring to the attention of the Mayor and the City Attorney any violations or lack of compliance herewith. 
 
In order to carry out the purposes of the regulations and to assure an orderly program of land development after the effective date of these regulations: 
 
1)   No plat of any tract of land within the planning area of the Planning Commission shall be accepted by the Circuit-Clerk Recorder for filing of record unless the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission, and the City Seal affixed.  The City Clerk shall have all such plats sealed and recorded. 
 
2)   No conveyance by metes and bounds of tracts or lots coming under the definition of subdivision of land, within the planning area jurisdiction, without compliance with the applicable provisions of this Code or amendments thereto shall be permitted. 
 
3)   No dedication of streets shall by itself be accepted by the City unless the usage of the adjoining, affected land is shown; if the purpose of opening the street is to make the affected land available for sale as a redevelopment or subdivision, the street may not be accepted until accompanied by the required plat. 
 
4)   No public utility, whether publicly or privately owned, shall provide, extend, or authorize the extension of services to any lot, building, structure, or location within the area under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission unless: 
 
A.   The lot, building, or structure was established before the adoption of this Land Subdivision and Development Code; or 
 
B.   A plat of the location has been approved by the Planning Commission and filed and recorded in the office of the Circuit Clerk-Recorder; or 
 
C.   The plan for the proposed service by the public utility has been approved by the Planning Commission as provided in the State Statutes. 
 
5)   No building permit shall be issued for any new structure on any lot or tract of land which does not comply with all of the provisions of this Code, including the installation of all improvements adjacent to or associated with said lot.   
 
9.2   Fees  The following guidelines apply to fees: 
 
1)   For each Preliminary Plat submitted, the fee shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) plus one dollar ($1.00) for each lot in the plat. 
 
2)   For each Final Plat submitted, the fee shall be ten dollars ($10.00) plus one dollar ($1.00) for each lot in the plat. 
 
3)   For each lot-split or minor subdivision filed, the fee shall be ten dollars ($10.00). 
 
4)  For each Large Scale Development, the fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
 
4)   In addition to the fees above, proposals which include street and drainage and/or utility improvements, shall be assessed a Review Fee which shall equal one percent (1%) of the Engineers Cost Estimate described in Article 5, Section 5.2.2.  Such Review Fee shall not be less than $100.00 or more than $2,900.00 per subdivision or development plat, or each subdivision phase plat submitted. 
 
5)   Recording Fees, and costs of all plans and documents required by this Code, shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or developer. 
 
9.3   Waivers  The rules and regulations set forth in this Code are the standard requirements of the City.  The Planning Commission may authorize a waiver from these regulations when, in its opinion, undue hardship would result from requiring strict compliance.  No waiver shall be granted except upon written petition by the subdivider when the preliminary plat is filed.  The petition shall state fully the grounds for the waiver and all the facts upon which the petition is made.  In granting a waiver, the Commission shall prescribe any conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable in the public interest.  In making the findings herein below required, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, proximity to public utilities, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such waiver upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience, and welfare in the vicinity.  No waiver shall be granted unless the Commission finds: 
  
1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this Code would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land. 
 
2)   That the granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or injurious to other property in the area. 
 
3)   That the granting of the waiver will not have the effect of preventing  the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
 
4)  The conditions upon which the waiver request is based are unique to the property and not generally applicable to other property. 
 
5)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular detrimental effect to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out. 
 
6) The request will not violate any other city, state, or federal laws.  
 
Such findings of the Commission, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the Commission meeting at which such waiver is granted.  Waivers may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Code so that the public health, safety, or welfare may be secured and substantial justice done.  Economic hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. Amended by Ord.16-758 
 
9.4   Vacation of Plats  The following guidelines apply to the vacation of plats: 
 
1)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same to be vacated.  Vacation of a plat shall be subject to the approval of the City Council if the plat is located within the corporate limits, and subject to approval of the Quorum Court if located outside the city limits but within the planning jurisdiction of the Clarksville Planning Commission as shown on the Planning Area Map which is included herein and made a part of this Code. 
 
2)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Planning Commission in like manner as plats of subdivisions.  The City Council may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets, or alleys. 
 
3)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or approved, and recorded or filed, in a manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat. 
 
4)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner herein provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of such writing. 
 
9.5   Amendments  On any proposed amendments to these regulations, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, for which fifteen (15) days advance notice in a local newspaper of general distribution has been published.  Following such hearing, the City Council may adopt the amendment or amendments as recommended by the Planning Commission or as determined by a majority vote of the City Council. 
 
9.6   Penalty  Any person, firm, or corporation that violates any provision of these regulations or amendments thereto shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00).  Each day that violation of these regulations is in effect shall constitute a separate offense and be subject to additional fines of twenty-five ($25.00) per day. 
 
Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken by law or in equity to prevent any violation of these regulations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, to prevent illegal occupancy of a building structure or premises, and these remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described above. 
ARTICLE 10.   LEGAL STATUS 
 
10.1   Conflicting Regulations  All ordinances or parts of ordinances inconsistent or in conflict with this Code are hereby repealed and amended to comply herewith by virtue of the ordinance adopting this Land Subdivision and Development Code. 
 
10.2   Separability  Any clause or provision of this Code declared invalid by the court shall not affect the validity of the regulation as a whole or any other part of the Code thereof. 
 
10.3   Effective Date  This Code shall take effect upon adoption by ordinance of the City Council of the City of Clarksville, Arkansas.  These regulations shall be printed in booklet form and made available to the general public.

ARTICLE 3. SPECIFIC DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Section 3.1 Residential Districts: The following regulations govern residential districts:
3.1.1 General Description: The residential zoning districts are designed to (1) protect the residential character
of the districts by excluding commercial and industrial activities, (2) encourage healthy neighborhoods by
allowing facilities as churches, schools and playgrounds, (3) permit certain community facilities and public
utilities for the convenience and general welfare of the people, and (4) preserve open space by requiring
minimum yard setbacks and lot sizes.
Six residential zoning districts are provided, including the following: R-1 Single-Family, R-2 Low Density
Residential, R-2 (AH) Affordable Housing District, R-3 Medium Density Residential District, R-4 Manufactured
Home District, and R-O Residential Office. A more specific description of each district is below.
1) R-1 Single-Family Residential - This is the most restrictive residential district. This district is primarily
intended for detached single-family dwellings. It is also intended for related parks, places of worship,
and schools that are needed for a healthy, attractive neighborhood. Adequate light, air, and open space
are provided to promote neighborhood stability, appearance, and efficiency.
This district is intended only for uses needed to provide a strong neighborhood. The R-1 district should
be buffered from commercial districts by other residential zoning districts such as R-2 or R-3. Where an
arterial street suitable for commercial development is located within an R-1 zone, only frontage lots
along the arterial street should be zoned commercial. In this case, other means of buffer protection shall
be required.
2) R-2 Low Density Residential District - This zoning district is intended to be similar to the R-1 district,
but allow more housing types and slightly higher population density. The district is primarily intended
for attached and detached single-family dwellings along with larger lot two-family dwellings.
3) R-2 (AH) Affordable Housing District - This district is similar to the R-2 zone except that manufactured
housing are permitted.
4) R-3 Medium Density Residential District - This is a residential district to provide for medium density
dwellings and a wide variety of housing types. It is primarily intended for single-family dwellings, twofamily
dwellings, townhouses, and multiple-family dwellings. It is also intended for related parks, places
of worship, and schools that are needed for a healthy, attractive neighborhood.
5) R-4 Manufactured Home District  This district is intended to provide for manufactured homes in a
either a rental park or subdivision. R-4 districts should be located in way that does not negatively impact
existing neighborhoods. It is also intended for related parks, places of worship, and schools that are
needed for a healthy, attractive neighborhood.
6) R-O Residential Office District  This district is intended to provide a place for those types of offices,
professional and service activities that provide for the regular needs or convenience of persons residing
in the city. It is further intended to preserve the residential character of the district while allowing for
the new construction of office structures and conversion of residential structures to office uses.

districts:
1) I-1 - Light Industrial District: This industrial use district represents the industrial park areas and also
areas suitable for the location of industries which place a heavy emphasis on aesthetics and public
relations as evidenced by the nature of their operations which is not detrimental to nearby residential
and quiet business districts and by their allocation of an ample amount of the site for landscaping, paved
off-street parking, and setbacks from surrounding property lines.
2) I-2 - General Industrial District This industrial district is intended for general and customary industrial
uses and activities as listed above in association with the I-1 district, but including also the bulk storage
of liquids and solids outside buildings and in the open spaces and the storage and assembly of goods and

by the nature of the operation, does not produce noise, dust, odor, or vibration that is
detrimental or dangerous to the health, safety, or general welfare of the community.
B. Any business, commercial, or industrial uses which do not create unusual hazards of fire,
explosions, noise, vibration, dust, or the emission of smoke, odor or toxic gases. No use which
would involve the manufacture, processing, or storage of any material or goods which has a high
hazard of fire, explosion, or of a toxic nature shall be permitted as a use by right in the I-1 Light
Industrial District.

except the uses so permitted by virtue of their being permitted in a C-3 Highway Commercial
District and specifically listed in paragraph 1) of Section 3.3.2 are not permitted in the I-2
Industrial District.
Page 16 Zoning Code
City of Clarksville
B. Uses or activities which involve in addition to customary and normal manufacturing and
industrial processes the storage of bulk materials when it is found that the specific location and
the safeguards provided so reduce the danger from fire or explosion as not to be dangerous to
the health, safety, or general welfare of the community and especially nearby properties.
C. While the permitted uses described above in Sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) are permitted in the
I-2 District by right, the following provisions pertain to extraordinary situations and those which
do not mesh with the stipulations and regulations prescribed above in this subsection. Industrial
uses having unusual accompanying hazards, such as fire, explosion, noise, vibration, dust, or the
emission of smoke, odor, or toxic gases may, if not in conflict with any law or ordinance in the
City of Clarksville or the State of Arkansas, be located in the I-2 Industrial District only after the
location and nature of such use shall have been approved by the City Council after public
hearing and report by the Planning Commission as normally required and provided in Article 4.
The City Council shall review the plans and statements and shall not permit such buildings,
structures, or uses until it has been shown that the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare will be properly protected, and that necessary safeguards will be provided for the
protection of surrounding property and persons. The City Council, in reviewing the plans and
statements, may consult with other agencies created for the promotion of public health and
safety, and may attach such special conditions or safeguards as it deems necessary to protect
the public interest, health and safety. With regard to the situations described herein, the
approval of the Planning Commission and the City Council shall be in accordance with the
stipulations and requirements pertaining to special permit uses as contained in Article 4. This
means that the use so allowed is not by right but rather by special permit.

uses in keeping with the objectives of the comprehensive plan and the purposes of this Code.
3.4.4 Regulations: The following regulations apply to Planned Unit Development (PUD):
1) Residential Lot Size: No minimum lot sizes are established, per se, so the housing can be clustered or
otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned locations on the site to take advantage of its natural
features.
2) Open Space Reservation: In any Planned Unit Development, the amount of land not used by
residential buildings, accessory structures, and yards but required by the residential zoning of the site,
shall be reserved collectively in contiguous units accessible to all the building sites in the development
as maintained open space for the purpose of providing parks, recreational facilities, ways for pedestrian

location of such lands, and accepts the dedicated areas, the City shall be responsible for the operation
and maintenance of these lands and properties.

maintenance and improvement running with the land for the benefit of the residents of the planned
unit development. The developer shall file, at the time the approved final plat is filed, legal documents
which will produce the aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, will provide for restricting the use of
common open spaces for the designated purpose.

consideration which shall include topography, trees, and ground cover, natural bodies of water, and
other significant natural features. Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The location of
trees shall be considered when planning the common open space, location of buildings, underground
services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas, and finished grade levels. The city shall inquire
into the means whereby trees and other natural features will be protected during construction.
Excessive site clearing of top soil, trees and natural features before the commencement of building
operations shall be discouraged by the city.

with minimum hazards to pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within planned unit development shall not be
connected to streets outside the development in such a way as to encourage their use by through
traffic.

unit development, said improvements shall conform to all requirements and standards as set forth in
the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Clarksville, unless exception to the requirements is
recommended by the Planning Commission.

public streets, the owners do fully agree that, before the acceptance of such streets by the City, the
owners will bear full expense of reconstruction or any other action necessary to make the streets fully
conform to the requirements applicable to public streets, prior to dedication and acceptance. The
owners also shall agree that these streets shall be dedicated to public use without compensation to the
owners.

Official.
11.3.2 Variances: The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide variance applications. A variance from the
terms of this Zoning Code shall not be approved by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
1) The applicant demonstrates that the literal enforcement of the Zoning Code would cause undue
hardship, and that the effect of the variance would not be contrary to the public interest.

land, structure or building involved. These special conditions and circumstance must not be applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
3) The applicant demonstrates that literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code would deprive

Page 69 Zoning Code
City of Clarksville
5) The applicant demonstrates that granting the variance requested will not give the applicant any
special privileges denied by this Zoning Code to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
6) The Board of Adjustment makes a finding of fact that the reasons provided by the applicant justify
granting the variance; that the variance is the minimum variance needed to make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure; that the granting of the variance would not violate the
spirit and intent of the Zoning Code; and that the effect of the variance will not cause injury to the
surrounding neighborhood or damage the public welfare.
No variance may be approved that would allow a use that is not permitted or that is implicitly or expressly
prohibited. The existence of a nonconforming use or structure shall not be used as grounds to justify approval of
a variance. The Board of Adjustment may provide conditions on the approval of a variance. Violation of these
conditions shall be considered a violation of this Zoning Code.

unclear or any question they may have concerning any gray area the Zoning Code Book does not clearly define

ordinance code book which should be waived for a particular situation or circumstance. This in no way precludes
the right of any citizen to seek relief from a decision of the building official as provided for in Article 10.
Section 12.2 Building Permit: Site Preparation for Commercial or Industrial Construction may begin upon
approval of the Site Plan by the Administrative Official and payment of the required fee, if required. However,
it shall be unlawful to begin residential site preparation or any construction, reconstruction, or structural

permit shall be issued unless the proposed construction or use conforms to all the provisions of this Code and
other applicable building laws, ordinances, or regulations. All applications for building permits shall be
accompanied by a plan in duplicate drawn to scale. The plan shall include the size of the building to be erected,
location on the lot, driveway, sidewalk, parking plan, and other information as may be required.

service or be used, occupied, or changed in use until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the
Administrative Official. It shall be the responsibility of the builder or contractor to obtain a certificate of
occupancy prior to selling, renting or making the building available for occupancy. A certificate of occupancy
may be revoked by the Administrative Official when it is found that the building or land does not conform to the
use or condition, if any, in the certificate. Each day a use continues after revocation of the certificate shall
constitute a separate offense and shall be punished as provided herein.

public hearing shall be conducted by the Planning Commission on the proposed amendment. Notice of the
public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least one time, at least 15
days prior to the hearing. Following the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall submit any

boundary. If the owner of property desires to revise the boundary line of a zoning district, he or his legally
designated agent shall submit to the Planning Commission a petition for such rezoning. The petition shall
provide the legal description of the property proposed for revision in boundary, a description of the property as
it is generally identified or known by the public (such as a street address; or in the case of a large tract, a
description of its general boundaries), the zoning classification requested for the property, an explanation of the
relationship of the proposed use to land uses surrounding the property, and any other optional information
which the owner feels should be brought to the attention of the Planning Commission. The disposition of the
petition shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 and 7 below.
12.6.3 Amendment and Abridgement: After adoption and proper filing of plans, ordinances, and regulations, no

prescribed above, or by a majority vote of the City Council.
Page 73 Zoning Code
City of Clarksville
12.6.4: Notice: Before a proposed revision in the boundary of a zoning district may be recommended by the
Planning Commission to the City Council, it must be the subject of a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing
on the rezoning petition shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least one time 15
days prior to the hearing. Additionally, the Building Official shall place a sign in a conspicuous place on the site of
property proposed for rezoning indicating the date and place of the public hearing on the rezoning proposal,
said sign to be placed on-site not fewer than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing.
12.6.5 Hearing and Approval: If all procedural requirements above are satisfied, the Planning Commission and
the City Council shall proceed in the following manner:
1) The Planning Commission shall conduct the public hearing on the proposed amendment to the Code
and/or Official Zoning Map.
2) Following the public hearing, the proposed amendment or change of district boundary may be
approved as presented or in reduced scope by a majority vote of the entire Planning Commission, with
recommendation for adoption by the City Council. Such modification shall not include a
recommendation to a less restrictive zone.
3) If the Planning Commission disapproves a proposed amendment or rezoning petition, the reason for
such disapproval shall be given in writing to the petitioner within 15 days from the date of the hearing.
4) Following disapproval of a proposed amendment by the Planning Commission, the petitioner may
appeal such disapproval to the City Council, provided that the petitioner states specifically in writing to
the City Clerk why he considers the Planning Commission's findings and decisions are in error. Such
appeal to the City Council shall be filed with the City Clerk within 15 days after receipt in writing of the
Planning Commission's denial. No such amendment will be considered by the City Council unless
appealed in accordance with this section.
5) The City Council, by a majority vote, may, by ordinance, adopt a recommended amendment
submitted by the Planning Commission or may return the proposed amendment to the Planning
Commission for further study and recommendation.
6) If the City Council does not concur with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, either as
first submitted or as submitted after re-study, or with regard to an appealed matter, the City Council
may, by majority vote, amend this Code by granting the request for amendment in full or in modified
form.
7) No application for a zoning amendment will be reconsidered by the Planning Commission for a period
of 12 months of elapsed time from the date of final disapproval of the proposed amendment, unless the
Planning Commission determines by 2/3 majority vote that a substantial reason exists for waiving this
mandatory waiting period.
Section 12.7 Fees: Any party or parties proposing a change in the zoning regulations or district boundaries may
make application and pay the appropriate fees at City Hall. Any party proposing the construction,
reconstruction, moving, demolition or major structural alteration of any building or any other action described
