§ 30.06  ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS.



   (A)   Recitals.



      (1)   On January 1, 2007, Public Act 94-1058, amending the
Open Meetings Act took effect and amended the definition of a “meeting”
to mean “Any gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference,
telephone call, electronic means (such as, without limitation, electronic
mail, electronic chat, and instant messaging), or other means of
contemporaneous interactive communication, of a majority of a quorum of the
members of a public body held for the purport of discussing public
business,” and it permits attendance of members of the public body at
public meetings by a means other than physical presence; and,



      (2)   To permit attendance by a means other than physical
presence, the Council of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois,
must adopt rules that conform to the requirements and restrictions of the
Open Meetings Act, ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, § 7; and,



      (3)   The corporate authorities of the City of Pinckneyville,
Perry County, Illinois, desire to permit attendance of members of the public
body by means other than physical presence in compliance with the Open
Meetings Act; and,



      (4)   The corporate authorities of the City of Pinckneyville,
Perry County, Illinois, find that it is necessary that any existing
ordinances, resolutions, or policies be amended to conform with the term
“meeting” to include electronic gatherings as defined in Section 120.1.02
of the Open Meetings Act.



   (B)   Adoption of Rules. The Council of the City of Pinckneyville,
Perry County, Illinois, hereby adopts the Electronic Attendance at Meetings
Rules, set forth in division (C) of this section, that permit a member of the
public body to attend any meeting of the public body as defined in the Open
Meetings Act via electronic means.



   (C)   Electronic Attendance at Meetings Rules.



      (1)   Rules Statement. It is the decision of the City of
Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois, that any member of the City Council
may attend any open or closed meeting of the City Council via electronic
means (such as by telephone, video, or internet connection), provided that
such attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.



      (2)   Prerequisites. A member of the City Council of the City
of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois, may attend a meeting electronically
if the member meets the following conditions: A quorum is physically present
throughout the meeting and a majority of the Council members votes to approve
the electronic attendance at the meeting.



         (a)   The member should notify the City Clerk at least
two days before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary
communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary
technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for electronic
attendance.



         (b)   The member must assert one of the following
reasons why he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:



            1.   The member cannot attend because of personal
illness or disability; or



            2.   The member cannot attend because of
employment purposes or the business of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry
County, Illinois; or



            3.   The member cannot attend because of a family
or other emergency.



         (c)   The City Clerk, after receiving the electronic
attendance request, shall inform the City Council of the request for
electronic attendance.



      (3)   Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a
quorum is physically present, the presiding officer shall call for a motion
that a member may be permitted to attend the meeting electronically after
specifying the reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically.
The motion must be approved by a vote of a majority of the members present.



      (4)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating
electronically and other members of the City Council must be able to
communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communication at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at
any meeting, the City Council shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish
this objective at the meeting site.



      (5)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be
considered on off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for
that meeting. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically
whether each member is physically present or present by electronic means.



      (6)   Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted
and adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard,
considered, and counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any
member attending electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and
his or her vote counted and recorded by the Clerk and placed in the minutes
for the corresponding meeting.  A member attending electronically may leave
a meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided the member
attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and returning.



   (7)   Committees, boards, and commissions. These rules shall apply
to all committees, boards, and commissions established by authority of the
City of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois.

conforming to all state and local statues governing the investment of public
funds.



   (B)   Scope. This policy includes all funds governed by the City
Council.



   (C)   Prudence. Investments shall be made with judgment and care,
under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion
and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. The standard of
prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the “prudent person”
standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio.



   (D)   Objective. The primary objective, in order of priority, shall
be:



      (1)   Legality - conformance with federal, state and other
legal requirements;

requirements;



      (3)   Liquidity - maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet
operating requirements;

meeting the entity’s needs for safety, liquidity, rate of return,
diversification and its general performance.



   (E)   Delegation of authority. Management and administrative
responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the City
Treasurer who, under the delegation of the City Council, shall establish
written procedures for the operation of the investment program.



   (F)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees
involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business
activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the
investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions.



   (G)   Authorized financial dealers and institutions. The City
Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to
provide investment services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of
approved security brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.



   (H)   Authorized and suitable investments. Investments may be made
in any type of security allowed for in state statutes regarding the
investment of public funds. Investments shall be made that reflect the cash
flow needs of the fund type being invested.



   (I)   Collateralization. Funds on deposit (checking accounts,
certificates of deposit, etc.) in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limits must be secured by some form of collateral, witnessed by a
written agreement and held at an independent - third party institution in the
name of the municipality.



   (J)   Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the city, shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held
by an independent third party custodian designated by the City Treasurer and
evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written custodial agreement.



   (K)   Diversification. The city shall diversify its investments to
the best of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow
needs of those funds. Diversification can be by type of investment, number of
institutions invested in, and length of maturity.

   (N)   Performance standards. This investment portfolio will be
managed in accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The

environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be
compared to benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity and credit quality as
the portfolio. The city’s benchmark will be the 90-day Treasury bill rate
and/or the state funds rate.



   (O)   Reporting. The City Treasurer shall prepare an investment
report at least monthly. The report



should be provided to the City Council and available on request. The report
should be in a format suitable for review by the general public. An annual
report should also be provided to the City Council.

shall become a final bill due and owing without further notice.



      (5)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and

as of the due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or
extend the time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing.  In
no event shall the time for filing a written protest for hearing be reopened
or extended for more than 90 days after the expiration of the 45 day period.



   (J)   Hearing.



      (1)   Whenever a taxpayer or tax collector has filed a timely
written protest and petition for hearing under division (I) of this section,
the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.



      (2)   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a
continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer.

granted shall not exceed 14 days.

      (1)   Interest.  The city hereby provides for the amount of
interest to be assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the
tax, to be 5% per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days
elapsed.



      (2)   Late filing and payment penalties.  If a tax return is
not filed within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax
ordinance, a late filing penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be
shown as due on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5%
of the tax due shall be imposed.  If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a
failure to file penalty shall be assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due
for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be
filed.  A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to
file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.



   (L)   Abatement.  The local tax administrator shall have the
authority to waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or
failure to file penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine
reasonable cause exists for delay or failure to make a filing.



   (M)   Installment contracts.  The city may enter into an
installment contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the
controlling tax ordinance.  The local tax administrator may not cancel any
installment contract so entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount
due and owing. Upon written notice by the local tax administrator that the
payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 days to cure any
delinquency.  If the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the 14
day period or fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the
installment contract with the local administrator, the installment contract
shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.



   (N)   Statute of limitations.  The city, through the local tax
administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and
inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing.  The taxpayer shall have 45
days after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request
for refund or provide any tax still due and owing.



      (1)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more
than four years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for
the applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return
for the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.



      (2)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four
year period for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be
issued by the city, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.



      (3)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent
tax return was filed by the taxpayer.



   (O)   Voluntary disclosure.  For any locally imposed and
administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an
audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a
taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator
for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due.  A taxpayer filing a voluntary
disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with
interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the
application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application.  A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may
not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. 
The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after
the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by
the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result
of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section
must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of
all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local
tax administrator, whichever is longer.



   (P)   Publication of tax ordinances. Any locally administered tax
ordinance shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements.
The posting of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication
requirements.  Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the
public upon request at the City Clerk’s office.



   (Q)   Lien review.  The local tax administrator shall establish an
internal review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for
unpaid taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the
lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect.  If the lien
is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:



      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the city’s expense;



      (2)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and



      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed
lien.



   (R)   Application.  This section shall be liberally construed and
administered to supplement all of the city’s tax ordinances.  To the
extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this
section, this section shall be controlling.

return of occupancy and of rents and of the taxes payable thereon on forms
prescribed by the City Clerk and consistent with returns required under The
Hotel Operators’ Occupation Tax Act (ILCS Ch. 35, Act 145, §1). The return
shall be due on or before the 20th day of the calendar month succeeding the
end of the monthly filing period. A separate return shall be filed for each
place of business within the city regardless of ownership.



      (2)   The first taxing period for the purpose of this section
shall commence on July 1, 2007, and the tax return and the payment for such
period shall be due on or before August 15, 2007. Thereafter the reporting
periods and tax periods shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
section.  At the time of filing of such tax returns, the operator may pay
the full amount of all tax due hereunder. If for any reason any tax is not
paid when due, a penalty at the rate of 1% for a 30-day period, or portion
thereof, from the date of delinquency shall be added and collected. In
addition, a penalty of 10% of the tax and interest due shall be assessed and
collected against any hotel or motel owner, operator, or licensee who shall
fail to collect and remit the tax imposed by this section.



   (E)   Failure to pay/enforcement. Whenever any person shall fail to
pay any tax or penalty herein provided, the City Attorney shall, upon request
of the Mayor, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment
of the tax on behalf of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction,
together with costs of such collection, including court costs and reasonable
attorney fees.



   (F)   Payment to the city. All proceeds resulting from the
imposition of the tax under Ordinance O-2007-08, including interest and
penalties, shall be paid into the treasury of the city and shall be credited
to and deposited into a separate fund designated to be a depository solely
for this municipal tax, from which the funds collected pursuant to the
ordinance shall be paid to the City Tourism Commission which shall utilize
and expend the funds solely to promote tourism and conventions within the
city and surrounding area or otherwise to attract non-resident overnight
visitors to the municipality. No funds received pursuant to the ordinance
shall be used to advertise for or otherwise promote new competition in the
hotel business.



   (G)   Certificate of registration required. It shall be unlawful and
a violation of this section for any person to engage in the business of
renting, leasing, or letting rooms in a hotel or motel within the city
without a certificate of registration from the City Clerk.  Such certificate
of registration shall be issued by the City Clerk on forms consistent with
those certificates issued by the State Department of Revenue under the
provisions of ILCS Ch. 35, Act. 145, § 5.



   (H)   City Tourism Commission. There is hereby created and
established a City Tourism Commission which shall consist of three members,
whose terms of office shall be three years and until their respective
successors are appointed and have qualified, to be appointed by the Mayor
with the consent of the City Council, which Commission shall direct and
control the promotion of tourism and conventions within the city and
surrounding area and develop plans to attract non-resident overnight visitors
to the municipality. Of the initial three members, one shall serve for a
period of three years, one for a period of two years, and one for a period of
one year. Thereafter, such members shall serve for a period of three years.
All members of the Commission shall serve without compensation, except that
if the Council deems it advisable, they may receive such compensation as may
be fixed from to time by said Council and provided for in the annual budget,
and provided that all Commission members shall be entitled to reimbursement
for all expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties,
including travel, meals, and lodging.



      (1)   Officers, records, reports. Immediately following their
appointment, the members of the Tourism Commission shall meet, organize,
elect the officers it may deem necessary, and adopt and later change or alter
rules and regulations of organization and procedure consistent with city
ordinances and state law. The Commission shall file an annual report with the
Mayor and City Council setting forth its transactions and recommendations.



      (2)   Powers and duties. The Commission shall have the
following powers and duties:



         (a)   To prepare and recommend to the Council a
comprehensive plan for the promotion of tourism within the municipality and
surrounding area;



         (b)   To prepare and recommend to the Council from time
to time plans and/or recommendations for specific promotions in pursuance of
the development of tourism within the municipality and surrounding area;



         (c)   To arrange and conduct any form of publicity
relative to its activities for the purpose of promoting tourism within the
municipality and surrounding area;



         (d)   To cooperate with municipal or regional planning
commissions and other agencies or groups to further tourism within the
municipality and surrounding area and to assure harmonious and integrated

(Ord. O-13-06, passed 9-9-13)



SEXUAL HARASSMENT



§ 34.10  PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The
courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination
under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All
persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all
genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the City of Pinckneyville
to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal
agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex
or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and
municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.



(Ord. O-2017-37, passed 12-27-17)



§ 34.11  DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as
stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual
harassment as:



      Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or
any conduct of a sexual nature when:




      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;





      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual; or





      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.




   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:



      (1)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other
employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.



      (2)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
“catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.



      (3)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual
nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.



      (4)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.



      (5)   Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically
sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use
of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all
forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network
websites like Facebook and Twitter).



   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are
easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment
is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of
what would offend a “reasonable person”.



(Ord. O-2017-37, passed 12-27-17)



§ 34.12  PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating
her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor.
It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making
the report.



   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:



      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual
harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly
and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and
request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal.
If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or
a memo.



      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.



         (a)   At the same time direct communication is
undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by
the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate
supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, adirector of
human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the
chief executive officer of the municipality.



         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes
to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the
conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.



      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this
policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for
responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified
and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the
right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a
formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within
180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A
complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.



   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.



   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation
and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing
cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate
outcome.



(Ord. O-2017-37, passed 12-27-17)



§ 34.13  PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS.



   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:



      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of
this policy;



      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into
any violation of this policy; or



      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce
the provisions of this policy.



   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, RETALIATORY ACTION means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer,
or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee
that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.



   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even
if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness
will be protected from retaliation.



   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained
herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, §
15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or
transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:



      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to
a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes
is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;



      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public
body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a
law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or



      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.



   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, §
15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative
commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has
reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or
law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule,
or regulation. (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(b)).



   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act
5, § 6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more
people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed
that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual
harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.



   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job
or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC,
may file a retaliation charge, due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC)
of the alleged retaliation.



(Ord. O-2017-37, passed 12-27-17)



§ 34.14  CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.



   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable
pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates
this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5,
Act 430, § 5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense,
applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable
fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or
federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline
imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty
imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court
of law or a state or federal agency.



(Ord. O-2017-37, passed 12-27-17)



§ 34.15  CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.



   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an
accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than
stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A
false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given
the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous
report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any
person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant
to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.



   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

hedge clippings, twigs, tree trimmings (not to exceed eight inches in
diameter), grass clippings, and similar vegetative refuse shall be placed for
collection. The Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements shall provide
notice of anticipated collection routes and dates to each utility customer on
a timely basis, additionally, all such owners, tenants, lessees, or occupants
may notify the City Clerk’s office of any accumulated debris ready for
collection and disposal and the city will use its best efforts to remove the
same within three working days. The city shall have the right to enter upon
each utility customer’s property who has indicated their desire to utilize
such services by the placement of such vegetative refuse in an accessible
location within five feet of the public street or right-of-way. If further
conditions or other circumstances prevent the collection of such refuse on
any scheduled day, then the city may return within a reasonable period of
time to avoid the undue accumulation of refuse.



   (C)   The fee for the collection and disposal of vegetative refuse
as provided for herein shall be $3 per month to all water customers residing
within the city. The fee shall be added as an additional charge on all
customers’ monthly billing; provided, however, that it shall be the duty of
the City Treasurer to set up and maintain an account separate from the
waterworks and sewerage system accounts in which all fees collected for this
service shall be placed.



   (D)   An additional fee is hereby imposed upon the homeowner for the
removal of trees and branches left by private contractors or subcontractors
pursuant to trimming or tree removal services to the property owner. The fee
for the collection and disposal of vegetative matter resulting from the
removal of trees and branches by private contractors or subcontractors shall
be $50 per truck load (up to five cubic yards). Any accumulation of refuse at
any residence exceeding one load shall presumptively be the result of the
removal of entire trees or branches by private contractors or subcontractors.
The additional charge shall be assessed against the property owner on the
immediately succeeding billing period for utilities. It shall be the duty of
the City Treasurer to set up and maintain an account separate from the
waterworks and sewerage system accounts in which all fees collected for this
service shall be placed. The fees charged pursuant to this division may be
held in an account with fees collected pursuant to division (C) above.

§ 51.41  METER READINGS CONCLUSIVE.



   (A)   All gas customers will be liable for the gas computation as
shown by the meter.  Waste, leakage or other causes not the fault of the
city shall be included under that liability.



   (B)   (1)   The meter reading shall be conclusive, provided when
a meter is found to have a positive average error, i.e., is fast in excess of
2% in tests made at the request of the customer, the city shall refund the
customer an amount equal to the excess charged for the gas incorrectly
metered, for a period of half of the time elapsed since the previous test,
but not to exceed six months.  No part of a minimum charge will be refunded.



      (2)   When a meter is found to have a negative average error,
i.e., is slow in excess of 2% in tests made at the request of the customer,
the city may make a charge to the customer for the gas incorrectly metered
for a period equal to half the time elapsed since the previous test, but not
to exceed six months.



      (3)   If a meter is found not to register for any period, the
city shall estimate the charge for the gas used by averaging the amounts over
similar periods, preceding or subsequent thereto, or over corresponding
periods in previous years.



(Ord. O-81-3, passed 5-18-81)



§ 51.42  METER TESTS.



   (A)   Any customer may request the city to make a test of the
accuracy of the meter then in use on their premises.  The tests will be made
by the city without charge, provided the meter has not been tested within
seven years preceding such a request.  In case a customer requests an
accuracy test of a meter which has been tested previously within seven years,
the customer shall be required, before the test, to deposit with the city the
sum of $35 to cover the cost of removing, testing and replacing the meter.



   (B)   The test standards described in § 51.41 shall be applicable
in determining accuracy of meters being tested.  Refunds of additional
charges will be based on determinations made according to those standards.



   (C)   In the event a meter is found, by testing, to register
incorrectly at full capacity by more than 2%, the test deposit shall be
refunded.  Past gas bills shall be  adjusted  by the percentage of the
amount  of  the gas bills for a period of not more than six months before
the test.



   (D)   In the event the meter is found to be registering correctly,
the customer shall forfeit the test deposit and the money shall be deposited
in the Gas Operating Funds of the city.



(Ord. O-81-3, passed 5-18-81)



§ 51.43  DAMAGE; TAMPERING.



   (A)   Whenever a meter, regulator or other equipment of the city is
found to have been damaged for any cause, the damage shall become the
liability of the customer, who shall pay the city the actual cost of removal,
repair and/or replacement of the damaged equipment.



   (B)   In the event damage has been caused by inaccurate metering,
the gas bills shall be corrected in the manner previously provided for herein.



   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or
customer to break the seal of any meter or in any manner to make alterations,
changes or repairs on the same or to open any mains, laterals, service pipes,
stop cocks, valves or any part thereof or otherwise tamper with or attempt to
do any work on either or any of the same without authority of the city or its
properly authorized agents.  Any person who violates any of the provisions
of this division or who shall willfully or maliciously injure or damage any
property connected with the gas system of the city shall be subject to the
provisions of § 51.99.

appurtenances connected to the system and located on private property shall
be open to inspection by the proper officers or employees of the city.  Any
part found defective or not in compliance with all provisions of this chapter
shall be repaired or corrected immediately.  Service may be discontinued
without notice at any time when conditions of privately or publicly owned
facilities create danger or hazard.

piping terminates at the outlet of the customer meter.



   (B)   All house piping shall be of rigid construction.  The pipe
from the outlet of the meter shall be of black iron pipe of not less than
1-inch inside diameter and shall enter the house wall by means of a suitable
metal strap or clamp at a point not more than 18 inches from the outlet
connection of the meter, or if extended along the outside wall, shall be
fastened to the wall at intervals sufficient to make the piping rigid
throughout.  In instances where piping from the meter enters the wall, the
interior end shall be securely fastened so the pipe will not turn when
fittings at the meter are put on.  The final tie-in of the gas line to the
meter shall be made by the city.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 52.001  WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM COMBINED.



   The City Council deems it advisable, necessary and in the best interest
of the city that the existing municipally owned waterworks system of the city
and the existing municipally owned sewerage system of the city be combined
and operated and maintained as a combined waterworks and sewerage system, the
combined system to include the entire waterworks and sewerage facilities of
the city, including all future improvements and extensions thereto.



(Ord. O-75-1, passed 5-19-75)



§ 52.002  STATE LAW TO PREVAIL.



   In the event any provision or regulation of this chapter shall be in
conflict with any law of the state, this chapter shall be deemed amended to
conform to the law or regulation.



(Ord. O-82-1, passed 2-1-82; Am. Ord. O-88-5, passed 4-18-88)



§ 52.003  USE OF WATER ON CUSTOMER’S PREMISES.



   The city shall have the right to use the water from the customer’s
facilities at any time deemed necessary.  No charge shall be made by the
customer for the use of his or her facilities and no charge shall be made by
the city for the water used by the city.



(Ord. O-82-1, passed 2-1-82; Am. Ord. O-88-5, passed 4-18-88; Am. Ord.

§ 52.004  CITY NOT LIABLE FOR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE OR SUPPLY.



   (A)   The city shall have the right to shut off the supply of water
and/or sewer service at any time to make repairs, improvements, enforce rules
or for any operating reason.  Where possible, a reasonable notice of the
circumstances will be given to the customers, but in an emergency, water and
sewer service may be shut off without notice.  The city shall not be held
responsible or liable because of any shutoff, discontinuance or service,
failure of any part of the system, for concentration of water or for any
direct or resultant damages to any person, company or customer.



   (B)   In the event of the discontinuance, water and/or sewer
services shall not be renewed until the city authorities have determined it
is in the best interest of the customer to restore the service.  In no case
shall the customer turn on his own service.  The turning on or shutting off
of valves will be done by the city.  Where the nature of the customer’s
operations are such that an interruption of service might create a hazard or
large economic loss, the customer shall provide facilities for standby at his
or her discretion.



   (C)   Any customer with critical water requirements must have an
alternate water source.  Failure to provide it shall be consideration a
violation of customer rules and loss or damages resulting therefrom shall be
the responsibility of the customer.  Those customers shall include, but not
be limited to, manufacturers, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, greenhouses,
hatcheries or any other building or business which might suffer any type of
loss due to interruption of water or sewer service.



   (D)   The city expressly stipulates with all customers and other
persons who may be affected by the discontinuance of service that it will
neither insure nor be responsible or liable in any manner for any loss or
damages, direct or indirect, by reason of fire or any other cause and all
water and sewer service furnished also shall be conditional upon acts of God,
inevitable accidents, failure of supply, fire, strikes, riots or any other
causes.

§ 52.005  EASEMENTS.



   The customer shall give easements and rights-of- way as necessary to
the city and allow access for the purposes of construction, repair,
maintenance, meter readings, relocation or expansion of the combined water
and sewerage system.  The necessity shall be determined by the City Council.

§ 52.006  EXTENSION POLICY.



   (A)   The city shall not be required to extend service within the
city limits a distance of more than 100 feet per customer and only then when
sufficient funds are available in excess of those required for the proper
operation of the system.  Extension of mains and service outside the city
limits shall be subject to approval of the City Council and also shall be
subject to all of the rules, regulations and provisions as provided herein or
as amended.



   (B)   The Council first shall determine if any extension of water
main is economically feasible, based on the estimated costs of the extension
and the number of existing potential users that will use water along the
extension.  If the extension is economically feasible, the city may install
and pay the cost of the extension at the discretion of the Council.  All
mains, lines and equipment shall immediately become the property of the city.



   (C)   If the Council elects not to pay the costs of extending the
mains, the person or persons desiring the service may install the extension
at their own personal expense, upon the written consent by the Council.  The
city shall not pay for any extension to an undeveloped area, such as a
subdivision being developed, unless there are sufficient existing residents
or businesses to make the extension economically feasible.

§ 52.023  WATER LEAK INSURANCE COVERAGE.



   (A)   The Mayor and City Clerk are authorized to procure and place
in force water leak insurance coverage through Sunbelt Insurance Group to
provide coverage for lost city revenue resulting from adjustments to customer
water and sewer bills for customer water leaks.



   (B)   Effective with bills for city water and sewer services issued
in October 2017, the city shall charge each water and sewer customer of city
the sum of $ 1.40 per month to apply toward the premium cost of the water
leak insurance coverage. Such monthly charge shall be in addition to the
monthly charges for usage.



   (C)   Any water or sewer customer of the city who wishes to
terminate or prevent the monthly charge for the water leak insurance premium
may decline coverage and waive the right to request bill adjustments by
signing and delivering to the City Clerk a written election to decline such
coverage. The City Clerk shall provide an election form to any customer upon
request. No charge for water leak insurance shall be added to any subsequent
monthly bill for any water or sewer customer who provides the written
election form to the City Clerk. City water and sewer customers who decline
insurance coverage and who waive the right to request an adjustment to water
and sewer bills shall remain responsible for payment of all water and sewer
charges in full as shown by the metered usage as provided in § 52.051 of the
City Code. Such customers shall not be entitled to any adjustment of excess
charges resulting from leaks in customer’s service lines.



   (D)   For any city water and sewer customer who pays the monthly
charge for the premium cost of water leak insurance, the customer may one
time each twelve month period request an adjustment to the customer’s water
and sewer bill and a reduction in “excess charges” resulting from leaks
in customer’s water lines. The excess charges shall be calculated to equal
the amount by which a monthly bill for water and sewer services exceeds the
preceding 12 month average bill for such customer. The city as an exception
to § 52.051 of the City Code will forgive one half the amount of such excess
charges upon proof that customer has repaired the leak. The customer shall be
responsible for payment of the remaining one half share of the excess
charges, plus the charges equal to customer’s preceding 12 month average
bill. Customer shall be entitled to an adjustment for charges arising from
water leaks one time during each 12 month period. Any customer who is allowed
an adjustment will cooperate with city to support the claim for benefits
under the city’s water leak insurance coverage.

as shown by the meter.  Waste, leakage or other causes not the fault of the
city may be included under the liability.  The meter reading shall be
conclusive, provided that when a meter is found to have a positive average
error, i.e., is fast in excess of the meter’s designed range of accuracy,
the city shall refund the customer an amount equal to the excess charged for
the water incorrectly metered for a period of three months.  No part of a
minimum charge will be refunded.



   (B)   When a meter is found to have a negative error, i.e., is slow
in excess of the meter’s designed range of accuracy, the city may make a
charge to the customer for the water incorrectly metered for a period of
three months.  If a meter is found not to register for any period, the city

§ 52.052  TESTS.



   (A)   Any customer may request the city to make a test of the
accuracy of the meter then in use on their premises.  The tests will be made
by the city or some person designated by the city’s Utilities Super-
intendent.  In case a customer requests an accurate test of a meter, the
customer shall be required, prior to the test, to deposit with the city the
sum estimated by the city’s Utilities Superintendent to cover the costs of
removing, testing and replacing the meter.  The test standards described in
§ 52.051 shall be applicable in determining accuracy of meters being
tested.  Refunds of additional charges will be based on determinations made
according to those standards.



   (B)   In the event such a meter is found, by testing, to have a
positive error, the test deposit shall be refunded.  Past water bills shall
be adjusted by the percentage of the amount of the water bills for a period
of three months previous to the tests.



   (C)   In the event the meter is found to be registering correctly or
with a negative error, the customer shall forfeit the test deposit and the
funds shall be deposited in the waterworks and sewerage funds of the city.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES



§ 53.35  BASIS FOR.



   (A)   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic
user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, applicable
surcharges and local capital cost charge composed of a debt service charge
and a capital improvement charge.



   (B)   The debt service charge is computed by dividing the annual
debt service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users.  Through
further divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service charges can be
computed.



   (C)   The capital improvement charge is levied on all users to
provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage
treatment works.  The capital improvement is computed by apportioning the
annual amount to be accrued as a cost per 1,000 gallons or as a fixed charge
per month.



   (D)   (1)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the
following normal domestic concentrations:



         (a)   A five-day, 20° C. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD
of 200 mg/l).



         (b)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/1.



      (2)   The charge shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:



         (a)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and
pounds of BOD to be treated.



         (b)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to
operate and maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund
for the year, for all works categories.



         (c)   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance
and replacement costs to each user class by volume, suspended solids and BOD.



         (d)   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance
and replacement costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended
solids and BOD.



         (e)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage
strength.



         (f)   Compute surcharge costs per pound per 1,000
gallons, in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.



      (3)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters
exceed the normal domestic con- centrations of BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (240
mg/l).  The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 240
mg/l concentration for BOD and SS respectively.



      (4)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for
the city in their annual audit report.  The wastewater service charge shall
be revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or a
change in operation and maintenance costs including, replacement costs.



      (5)   The users of wastewater treatment services will be
notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater
treatment operation, maintenance and replacement.

§ 53.36  MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.



   (A)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 10 gallons.



   (B)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the
public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the
public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense,
water meters of a type approved by the Commissioner of Public Works for the
purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.



   (C)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Commissioner of these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.



   (D)   Metering devices for determining the volume of wastes shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person.  Following approval and
installation, the meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the Commissioner.

all users whose water consumption does not exceed 1,000 gallons per month.



      (2)   A basic user rate of $2.65 per 1,000 gallons shall be
applied to all users for water consumption in excess of 1,000 gallons per
month.



   (B)   All non-metered residential users of the wastewater facilities
shall pay a minimum flat rate charge per month adequate to cover the costs of
the minimum accrual capital cost charge, the minimum service charge and the
basic user rate of $6 per 1,000 gallons.  The flat rate charge will allow a
maximum of 1,000 gallons per month.



   (C)   In the event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by
the Commissioner of Public Works to be in excess of 1,000 gallons per month,
the Commissioner may require the flat rate user to install metering devices
on the water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.

city the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to
pay all lien holders of record, up to the total amount of penalties and fees
imposed under this subchapter.



      (3)   If a person entitled to lawful possession does not
redeem the impounded vehicle within 30 days after the vehicle is impounded or

vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle posts
with the city a cash bond of $500 plus fees for towing and storing of the

      (7)   The towing company shall permit any person appointed by
the Chief of Police to inspect its wreckers, vault, security room or storage
area at such times as the Chief of Police shall deem appropriate.

      (1)   The owner or person in possession of any towed or stored
vehicle shall pay all costs incidental to towing and storage to the towing

§ 115.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.



   (A)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate
sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment
to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter
to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.



   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports
made available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases
of City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 146 L.Ed.2d 265, 120 S.Ct.
1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books,
Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky., 479 U.S. 92
(1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v.
LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968);
DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Kev, Inc. v.
Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of
Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v.
City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. City of
Houston, 27 F.Supp.2d 754 (S.D. Tex.1998)), as well as studies conducted in
other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden
Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin,
Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and
Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney
General’s Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney
General’s Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses
(June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the City Council finds that:



      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to
ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled
by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no
mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.



      (2)   Crime statistics show that all types of crimes,
especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods
where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the
cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.



      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal
sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also
Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at
377.



      (4)   Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g.,
Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at
376-77.



      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades,
and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex
within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.



      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not
limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida.



      (7)   As of June, 2001, the total number of reported cases of
AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was
793,025. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.



      (8)   As of December, 2001, there have been more than 26,200
reported cases of AIDS in the State of Illinois. See
http://www.idph.state.il.us/public- /hb/hbaids.htm.



      (9)   The total number of cases of genital chlamydia
trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a
6% increase over the year 1999. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at
http://www.cdc.gov.



      (10)   The total number of cases of early (less than one year)
syphilis in the United States reported during the four year period 1996-2000
was 212,672. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.



      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases
reported during the period 1996-2000. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.



      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report
of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection
may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.



      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence available,
AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally
transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at
http://www.cdc.gov.



      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented
businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities
and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to
self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g.,
Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at
377.



      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that
bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually
oriented businesses where persons view “adult” oriented films. See, e.g.,
Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography (1986) at
377.



      (16)   Adult uses have operational characteristics that should
be reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns.



      (17)   Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages
prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal
activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).



      (18)   Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the
likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap
County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986).



      (19)   Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases
the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and
encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public
health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. City
of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.2000); Sammy’s Ltd. v. City
of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1052,
146 L.Ed.2d 459, 120 S.Ct. 1553 (2000). The findings noted in divisions
(B)(1) through (B)(18) raise substantial governmental concerns.



      (20)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational
characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect
those substantial governmental concerns.



      (21)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate
mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure
will place a heretofore non-existent incentive on operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of
the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the
licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.



      (22)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring
sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult establishments.



      (23)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons
ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the
sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related
to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will
aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal
activity.



      (24)   It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the
spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information
regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is
designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.



      (25)   When more than one sexually oriented business use
occupies the same location or business address, the secondary effects caused
by such businesses are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or
controlled to a greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business
use is allowed to occupy the same location.



      (26)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the
citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of this chapter.

occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage.  This chapter does not
create liability on the part of the city, or any officer or employee thereof,
for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.



(Ord. O-2006-13, passed 11-20-06)

PERMITS



§ 150.30  DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.



   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
state law shall commence any development in the floodplain without first
obtaining a development permit from the Commissioner of Public Property. The
Commissioner of Public Property shall not issue a development permit if the
proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.



   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:



      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property
line dimensions;



      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade
resulting from excavation or filling;

   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the
Commissioner of Public Property shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood elevation.  Any development located on land that can be shown
by survey data to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the
date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in
the floodplain and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. The Commissioner of Public Property shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site, and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood
Insurance Rate Map identification.

VARIANCES



§ 150.50  APPLICATION.



   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Commissioner of
Public Property, or his or her designee, for a variance.  The Commissioner
of Public Property shall review the applicant’s request for a variance, and
shall submit his or her recommendation to the City Council.  The City
Council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this chapter.



(Ord. O-2006-13, passed 11-20-06)



§ 150.51  NOTICE AND PROCEDURE.



   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
floodplain;



      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance
were not granted;

utilities or other public facilities;



      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and



      (7)   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained.



   (B)   The Commissioner of Public Property shall notify an applicant
in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protection
standards of § 150.41 that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to $25 for $100 of insurance coverage:



      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property: and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks, and acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.



   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of § 150.41
requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration of a
site or building included on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted, using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of § 150.51(A)(1) through (5).



(Ord. O-2006-13, passed 11-20-06)



§ 150.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain,
or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance, shall be
deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the
Commissioner of Public Property may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The Commissioner of Public Property shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.



   (B)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the
violation:



      (1)   The city shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter, or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;



      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined not less than $100 nor more than $200; and



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.



   (C)   The Commissioner of Public Property shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and, therefore, may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.



   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

    This chapter divides the city into various districts and permits each
district, as a matter or right, only those uses which are clearly compatible
with one another. Certain other uses, because of their special operations or
physical characteristics, may or may not have a detrimental impact on nearby
permitted uses, depending upon their precise location, matter of operation,
and other factors. Such special uses require careful case-by-case review to
determine if compatibility can be achieved. Special use permits shall be
effective for an unlimited period of time provided that the special use is
made at all times in compliance with the terms of any stipulations and
conditions established upon issuance of the special use permit. In the event
the special use at any time fails to comply with any permit stipulation or
condition, the special use permit may be terminated as hereinafter provided.

§ 154.040.A  TERMINATION OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT.



   (A)   If at any time a special use fails to comply with the terms of
a special use permit, including compliance with any stipulations or
conditions established at the time the special use permit is issued, the
special use shall be promptly restored to compliance or, if not restored, may
be terminated as hereinafter provided.



   (B)   In the event any special use is determined to be in violation
of the terms and conditions of an existing special use permit, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the permit holder and the property owner in
writing specifying the nature of the violation and shall allow the permit
holder and property owner a 14 day period in which to abate the violation and
restore the use as permitted. The Zoning Administrator may extend the period
for abatement for a reasonable period of time in the event abatement is
commenced within the 14 day period but cannot reasonably be completed within
the 14 day period. The abatement shall be promptly completed and the permit
holder and property owner shall notify the zoning administrator when all
action has been completed to abate the violation.



   (C)   If the violation has not been abated within the 14 day period
after notice, or within such additional time as may be allowed by the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall arrange for a public hearing
before the Zoning Board of Appeals to determine whether the special use
permit should be terminated or modified. The Zoning Administrator shall give
the permit holder and property owner not less than ten days notice of the
date, time and place of the public hearing and the permit holder and property
owner shall be allowed an opportunity at the hearing to show cause why the
special use permit should not be terminated. In determining whether a special
use permit should be terminated or modified, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider whether the special use violates the terms and conditions of
the existing special use permit and may also consider the factors set forth
in § 154.040.



   (d)   Within 30 days after the public hearing, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall issue a decision on whether the special use permit shall be
terminated or modified. In the event a special use permit is terminated, the
permit holder and property owner shall immediately terminate any use which is
not permissible not authorized in compliance with city zoning ordinances. In
the event of a termination of the special use permit, the permit holder and
property owner may not reapply for a special use permit for the same property
within 180 days of the permit termination. If a special permit use is
modified after hearing, the permit holder and property owner shall
immediately comply with the permit as modified.

§ 154.050  ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS DECISION ON VARIANCE.



   Within a reasonable time after public hearing on the application for a
variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its decision after
considering the following factors:



   (A)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purpose
of this chapter;



   (B)   The proposed variance does not involve a use of land not
permitted in the zone district;



   (C)   Strict application of the district requirements would result
in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and prevent a
reasonable return on the property;



   (D)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and allow a
reasonable return on the property;



   (E)   The plight of the applicant is due to circumstances not from
his own making;



   (F)   The circumstances engendering the variance request are
peculiar and not applicable to other property within the district and,
therefore, that a variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an
amendment (re-zoning); and



   (G)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the area where the premises in question are located nor
materially frustrate implementation of the city’s Comprehensive Plan.

SPECIAL USE REGULATIONS



§ 154.260  GENERAL.



   This subchapter establishes lot and structure requirements. This
includes design standards and use limitations for specific, potentially
troublesome structures and uses. These regulations apply in every zoning
district where the specific structure or use is permitted; but, if more
stringent regulations are applicable in any particular district, such
regulations shall prevail. It is the intent of this subchapter to provide
peace, quiet, and domestic tranquility, and maintain the character of all
residential neighborhoods within the city. It is further the intent of this
subchapter to guarantee all residents freedom from excessive noise, traffic,
nuisances, fire hazards, and other possible effects of commercial uses being
conducted in residential areas. Therefore, the purpose of this subchapter is
to define those conditions under which commercial uses commencing after
adoption of this chapter shall operate.



(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)



§ 154.261  HOME OCCUPATIONS.

   (A)   Unrelated employees. A home occupation shall employ not more
than one individual who is unrelated to the family residing on the premises.



   (B)   Floor space. In Residential Districts, the total area used for
a home occupation shall not exceed 25% of the gross floor area of the
dwelling, or 300 square feet, whichever is less.



   (C)   Neighborhood interference. The home occupation shall not
interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of neighboring residential
properties and shall be located or conducted so that the average neighbor,
under normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence.



   (D)   Dwelling alterations. A dwelling shall not be altered to
accommodate a home occupation in such a way as to materially change the
residential character of the building.



   (E)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage of equipment or materials
used in connection with a home occupation is prohibited in Residential
Districts; however, limited use of an enclosed accessory structure is
permissible for such storage needs.



   (F)   Nuisances. A home occupation shall not generate any offensive
noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, glare or electrical interference
noticeable at or beyond the boundary lines of the lot.



   (G)   Parking. Every home occupation shall provide two off-street
parking spaces in addition to the usual requirements for the dwelling if any
need for parking is generated by the conduct of the home occupation. Said
parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling.



   (H)   Traffic. No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation
in volumes that would infringe upon the safety and welfare of the residential
neighborhood.



   (I)   Delivery. There shall be no commodity sold or services
rendered that require delivery or shipment of merchandise, goods, or
equipment by motor vehicles exceeding 12,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.

identification/advertising sign attached to the home or accessory building.
The area of said sign shall not exceed six square feet and shall not be
illuminated.



   (K)   Hours of operation. In no case shall a home occupation be open
to the public at times earlier than 6:00 a.m. nor later than 6:00 p.m.



   (L)   Accessory structures. Garages or carports, whether attached or
detached, shall not be used for home occupations other than for the storage
of automobiles.



   (M)   Required notice. Any person wishing to begin operation of a
home occupation shall be required to register such intent in advance of the
initiation of business with the Zoning Administrator and agree in writing to
the terms and conditions of divisions (A) through (L) of this section. Such
agreement shall constitute the acceptance of these terms and permission of
the city to initiate business operations. Failure to comply with these terms
shall result in violation of this subchapter and may result in withdrawal of
approval of the operation of the home occupation.



   (N)   Businesses operating in residential areas at the time of
adoption. Nonconforming businesses operating in residential areas at the time
of adoption of this chapter may, within 180 days after adoption, voluntarily
register with the Zoning Administrator in order to ensure nonconforming
status. Such registration will be at no charge, and will only be used to
identify businesses for the purpose of applicability to nonconformance
exemptions described in §§ 154.300 through 154.307.

NON-CONFORMITIES



§ 154.300  PURPOSE.



   The requirements imposed by this chapter are designed to guide the use
of land by encouraging the development of structures and uses that are
compatible with the predominant character of each of the various districts.
Lots, structures and uses of land or structures that do not conform to the
requirements of the district in which they are located impede appropriate
development For example, non-conformities are frequently responsible for
truck traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities,
the creation of nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values. The
regulations of this subchapter are intended to alleviate such existing or
potential problems by encouraging the gradual elimination of
non-conformities. However, it is the intent of this subchapter to permit
these nonconformities to continue for the duration of their natural life and

   Any otherwise lawful structure which exists on the effective date of
this chapter but which could not be erected under the terms of this chapter
because of requirements/restrictions on lot size, height, setbacks or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions:



   (A)   Enlargement; alterations. No such structure shall be enlarged
or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.



   (B)   Relocation. No such structure shall be relocated unless, after

   (C)   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed except
to a use permitted under the applicable district regulations.



   (D)   Relocation. No nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or
in part, unless such use, upon relocation, will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district in which it is proposed to be located.



   (E)   Abandonment.



      (1)   Nonconformities shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located when,
as declared by the Zoning Board of Appeals, the nonconforming use is
abandoned for at least 45 days. Nonconformities shall be declared abandoned
when the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that there exists substantive
evidence that the nonconforming user permanently intends to discontinue the
nonconformance. Such evidence may include, but not be limited to, oral and/or
written statements by the nonconforming user avowing such intent, or
permanent departure of the nonconforming user from the location of the
nonconformity without evidence intent to sell, lease, or transfer deed.



      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the Zoning Board
of Appeals of the declaration of abandonment and present evidence support
that declaration. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall either affirm or nullify
the declaration based on the evidence presented. If the declaration is
affirmed, the date of declaration will remain that originally entered by the
Zoning Administrator.



   (F)   Sale or transfer of use. A nonconforming use shall not be
prohibited with the sale or transfer of deeds if the nonconforming use is
sustained.

into number of parking spaces, 400 square feet of gross area shall be deemed
one parking space.



   (D)   If computation of the number of parking spaces required by
this chapter results in a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or more
shall be counted as one space.



   (E)   No space or portion thereof needed to satisfy the minimum
applicable requirement for number of off-street parking spaces shall be
counted as part of the off-street parking spaces required for another
structure or use.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)



§ 154.340  INTENT AND PURPOSE.



   This subchapter establishes provisions for rezoning of land within the
city to provide for a Planned Unit Development (PUD). The purpose of this
subchapter, Planned Unit Development, is to achieve the objectives enumerated
in § 154.001 plus the following additional objectives:



   (A)   To provide a regulatory mechanism whereby the city can be
assured that upon completion, approved development projects will
substantially conform to the plans or models which constituted the basis for
the city’s issuance of the necessary zoning, subdivision, and/or building
permits;



   (B)   To permit development of a wide variety of building types and
other structures and uses in a single comprehensively planned project;



   (C)   To preserve the significant and prime farm land, natural
topography, scenic features, mature trees, and historic structures existing
on sites proposed for development;



   (D)   To encourage innovative site layouts and coordinated
architectural treatment of different building types and other structures and
uses;



   (E)   To ensure the provision of usable common open space in planned
developments, and to spur installation of various amenities therein;



   (F)   To facilitate the economical installation of standard streets,
sewers, utilities, and other improvements.



(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)



§ 154.341  COMPLIANCE WITH ORDINANCES.



   Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section, Planned Unit
Developments (PUDs) shall, comply and conform with all applicable codes and
ordinances including this Zoning Chapter and the Subdivision Ordinance.



(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)



§ 154.342  WHERE DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED.



   Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) may be built in any geographic
location affected by this chapter, but only upon rezoning and a Planned Unit
Development District by the Zoning Commission.



(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)



§ 154.343  PERMISSIBLE DEVIATION FROM ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.



   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) concept is intended to afford both
the developer and the city considerable flexibility in formulating
development proposals. Consequently, to the extent indicated in this section,
PUDs may deviate from generally applicable ordinance requirements without a
variance. Any proposed deviation not listed below, however, shall require a
variance.



   (A)   Mixed uses. PUDs may include all types of buildings and other
structures and uses approved by the Zoning Commission; provided, that in
approving such mixed construction and uses, the Zoning Commission may attach
any conditions necessary to protect the public welfare.



   (B)   Lot and structure requirements. In PUDs, the Zoning Commission
may approve any reasonable deviation from the lot and structure requirements
of the particular zoning district so long as the different uses within the
PUD are appropriately interrelated and property abutting the PUD is
adequately protected from any potential adverse impacts of the development.
LOT AND STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS means minimum individual lot area, width, and
depth; minimum setbacks; and maximum structure height.



   (C)   Location of parking/loading spaces. By permission of the
Zoning Commission, off-street parking and loading spaces in PUDs need not be
located in accordance with generally applicable requirements. The minimum
number of such spaces, however, shall not be less than the number required as
per §§ 154.320 through 154.328.



(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)

electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or
structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant’s proposed antenna.



         (e)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required
by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt an
existing tower or structure for sharing, are unreasonable based upon market
information. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.



         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other
limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.



         (g)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative
technology that does not require the use of towers or structures is
unsuitable.



         (h)   Applicants are required to demonstrate by
providing proof of certified mailings or other reasonable means:



            1.   That they have contacted the owners of
reasonably suitable structures within a 1,000 foot radius of the proposed
site and, which from a location standpoint, could provide part of a network
for transmission of signals;



            2.   Have asked for permission to install the
antenna on those structures; and



            3.   Were denied for reasons other than economic
feasibility.

any permit holder has violated any provision of this subchapter, or the
conditions, restrictions or additional development standards of an approved
special use; or has failed to make, in reasonable good faith, efforts to
provide or seek co-location, the Zoning Commission shall notify the permit
holder in writing that the TAP is revocable due to the permit holder’s
noncompliance with the conditions of the permit. The Zoning Commission shall
convene a meeting with the permit holder no later than 30 days from the date
of the letter. The Zoning Commission may require the permit holder to correct
the violation within a reasonable amount of time or may recommend to the

Should the permit holder fail to correct the deficiencies in the time
required, the Zoning Administrator shall request that the City Council
convene a public hearing to consider revocation of the TAP. The hearing shall
be conducted pursuant to notice by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city not less than 15 days prior to the hearing. The
permit holder may be represented by an attorney and may cross-examine
opposing witnesses. Other interested persons may comment. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may impose reasonable restrictions with respect to time and procedure
of the hearing. The proceedings shall be recorded. After the appropriate
public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals may revoke the TAP upon receipt
of evidence, which proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the permit
holder has violated or is in noncompliance with the provisions of this
subchapter. Upon such determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals may revoke
the permit upon such terms and conditions as it sees as reasonable.

sign permittee, or their agents, in a civil action to recover the money due

connected with the processing/conducting of the listed permits/procedures;
they do not constitute a tax or other revenue-raising device.



   (H)   Variance. A sign variance is a relaxation of the strict
application of requirements of this chapter that are applicable to a
particular lot, structure or sign. Every request for a variance shall be
treated in accordance with Illinois law (see ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-13-5,
ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-13-6, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-13-7, ILCS Ch. 65,
Act 5, § 11-13-7a) as provided in § 154.051.



      (1)   Every applicant for a sign variance shall submit to the
Zoning Administrator, on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator, the
items of information listed below. The Zoning Administrator shall promptly
transmit the completed application to the Zoning Board of Appeals together
with any recommendations or comments the Zoning Board of Appeals may deem
appropriate for their review and consideration.



         (a)   Name and address of the applicant;



         (b)   Location of the lot or structure for which the
sign variance is sought;



         (c)   Relationship of said lot or structure to adjacent
lots or structures:



         (d)   Specific section(s) of this chapter containing the
regulations which, if strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and



         (e)   Other pertinent information that the Zoning
Administrator may deem appropriate.



      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing
on each variance request within  a reasonable time after the variance
application is submitted to them. At the hearing any interested party
(including any school or other taxing district in which the property in
question is located) may appear and testify, either in person or by duly
authorized agent or attorney. Notice of the hearing shall be given not more
than 30 nor less than 15 days before the hearing:



         (a)   By first class mail to the applicant and to all
parties whose properties are within 100 feet the property for which the sign
variance is sought; and



         (b)   By publication in a newspaper of general
circulation within the city.



      (3)   Within a reasonable time after public hearing on the
application for a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its
decision after considering the following factors. The proposed variance is
consistent with the general purpose of this chapter:



         (a)   Strict application of the requirements would
result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and
prevent a reasonable return on the property;



         (b)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation
from such requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and
allow a reasonable return on the property;



         (c)   The plight of the applicant is due to
circumstances not from his own making;



         (d)   The circumstances engendering the variance request
are peculiar and not applicable to other property within the district and,
therefore, that a sign variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an
amendment (re-zoning); and



         (e)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the area where the premises in question are located
nor materially frustrate implementation of the city’s Comprehensive Plan.



   (I)   Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the
Zoning Administrator in any matter related to the interpretation or
enforcement of any provisions of this subchapter may appeal to the  Zoning
Board of Appeals.



      (1)   Filing, stay of further proceedings.



         (a)   Every appeal shall be made within ten days of the
matter complained of by filing with the Zoning Administrator a written notice
specifying the grounds for appeal. Thereupon, the Zoning Administrator shall
promptly transmit all pertinent records to the Zoning Board of Appeals.



         (b)   An appeal stays all further actions on the matter
being appealed unless the Zoning Administrator certified to the Zoning Board
of Appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him/her, that for
reason stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life
or property. In such case, further action shall not be stayed unless the
Zoning Board of Appeals or the circuit court grants a restraining order for
due cause, and so notifies the Zoning Administrator.



      (2)   Public hearing, notice. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider every appeal within a reasonable time after the filing of the
notice of appeal pursuant to division (H)(1) above and shall act upon such
not later than 30 days after the filing of the appeal. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify the appellant and all interested parties of the
time and place at which the appeal shall be heard and post public notice of
the proceeding at City Hall. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall render a
decision on the appeal by a simple majority vote of all members then holding
office or may modify or amend the order appealed to the extent and in a
manner as is appropriate in its discretion. The Zoning Board of Appeals
decision may be appealed to the City Council as provided in § 154.057.

   (A)   Any sign hereafter existing which advertises a business no
longer being conducted or a product no longer being sold on the premises upon
which the sign is located shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent
or person having the beneficial use of the building, structure or premises
upon which it may be found within 60 days after written notification from the

standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan
or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.



      (7)   Alternate placements.



         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions division (C), a wireless provider shall not be
required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility
pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple
antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an
application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with
a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be
collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept
if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose
technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.



         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by
the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate

utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities,
that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that
is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or
wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such
facility; or



            2.   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.



      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes
a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height
limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation,
the applicant shall apply for a [SPECIAL USE PERMIT OR VARIANCE] in
conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in Chapter 154 of
the Code of Ordinances of the City of Pinckneyville.

requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility
poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.



      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which
a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the
permit, unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period
or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by
the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the
issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after
issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city
grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the

the abandonment.



      (2)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, by the city to the owner at the last known
address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not
removed within 90 days of such notice, the city may remove or cause the

(Ord. O-2018-25, passed 7-23-18)



§ 155.05  INDEMNIFICATION.



   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the city harmless against

resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy
of the city improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by
the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of
the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of
the city or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive
any claims that they may have against the city with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.



(Ord. O-2018-25, passed 7-23-18)



§ 155.06  INSURANCE.

its activities on the city improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of city
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.



   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the city as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the city in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.



   (C)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the city. A wireless
provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional
insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the city.
