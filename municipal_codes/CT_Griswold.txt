Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation, it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM such as Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFE's provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. 
The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Griswold or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. The Town of Griswold, its officers, and employees shall assume no liability for another person's reliance on any maps, data or information provided by the Town of Griswold. 
For the purposes of this subsection of these Regulations, certain words or terms are defined as follows: (7/11/11) 
Above-ground Storage Tanks: Above ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.

(7/11/11) 
No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water: New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally dependent use or facility. (7/11/11) 
Portion of Structure in Flood Zone: If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone. (7/11/11) 
Recreational Vehicle: A vehicle which is: (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; (c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling put as a temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. (7/11/11) 
Special Flood Hazard Area: The area within Griswold subject to one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year, as identified on the Griswold FIRM.  (1/1/93) 
Start of Construction: Start of construction includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. 
32 

Griswold Zoning Regulations Revised: December 01, 2018 
The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units and not part of the main structure.  For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. (7/11/11) 
Structure: A walled and roofed building which is principally above ground, including a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures. (7/11/11) 
Structures in Two Flood Zones: If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE).  The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.) (7/11/11) 
Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.  (1/1/93) 
Substantial Improvement: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a one-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be either the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the occurring damage. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
Variance: A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the flood plain management regulation that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. (7/11/11) 
Violation: Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-roofing certifications or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be a violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (7/11/11) 
Water Surface Elevation: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the Floodplain of costal or riverine areas. (7/11/11) 
The following requirements are intended to reduce the threat to public safety and loss of property values resulting from periodic flooding and to ensure eligibility for continued participation by the Town of Griswold in the National Flood Insurance Program. In cases where conflicts occur between the requirements of the underlying zoning district and these SFHA requirements, the requirements of this subsection shall control. The following regulations apply with the SFHA: 
33 

Griswold Zoning Regulations Revised: December 01, 2018 
11.4.1 	All applications for Zoning Permits or Special Exceptions for new development or subdivisions (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres whichever is lesser, shall include with such applications base flood (a flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year) elevation data for that portion of development located within the SFHA. (7/11/11) 
11.4.2 	Within the SFHA, the following requirements shall be met: 
a. 	
All new construction and substantial improvement of residential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood level. 

b. 	
All new construction and substantial improvement of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated or flood-proofed to or above the base flood level. 


Nonresidential structures may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section. Such certification shall be provided to the Building Inspector. 
c. 	New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood water to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect to meet the following minimum criteria: 
1) 	Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one 
(1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2) 	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; 
3) 	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of flood water in both directions; 
4) 	Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood level; and 
5) 	Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or for the limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
d. 	All manufactured homes, including mobile homes and recreational vehicles placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer or substantially improved, shall be elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation.  This includes a manufactured home located outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood. 
34 

Griswold Zoning Regulations 	Revised: December 01, 2018 
The manufactured home shall be placed on a permanent foundation which is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement, and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures. Anchoring may include but not be limited to the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
The manufactured home shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage, providing adequate access and drainage, piling foundations (when used) no more than 10 feet apart, and reinforced of any piers more than six (6) feet above ground level. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either be on the site for fewer than 108 consecutive days, and be fully-licensed and ready for highway use, or meet all the general standards of Section 11.4.3 including the elevation and anchoring requirements of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by a quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; (7/11/11) 
e. 	When base flood elevation data or floodway data are not available, then the Commission shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of these Regulations. 
11.4.3 	Prior to issuing a Zoning Permit for proposed construction or development within the A or AE Zones, the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Commission shall review plans for such construction or development and require that: (7/11/11) 
a. 	
All sites shall be reasonably free from flooding; 

b. 	
New construction or substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 

c. 	
New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 

d. 	
New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices than minimize flood damage; 

e. 	
New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewer systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 

f. 	
On-site waste disposal systems are located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 

g. 	
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.  (1/1/93) 


11.4.4 	Within the floodway, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or any other source when no regulatory floodway has been designated, all encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements to existing structures, and other development are prohibited unless certification, with supporting technical date, by a Connecticut registered engineer is provided by the applicant demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachment shall not result in any  
35 

Griswold Zoning Regulations 	Revised: December 01, 2018 
(00.0 feet) increase in flood levels during a 100-year flood.  Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A permit may be given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations 44, Chapter 1, Subsection 65.12, as amended. (1/1/93) (7/11/11) 
When base flood elevations have been determined within Zone AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map but a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Commission must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community when all existing and anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. (7/11/11) 
The Commission may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses with FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available for any other source (in response to the municipality's request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. (7/11/11) 
11.4.5 	Applicants for development within the SFHA shall submit with their applications assurances that the flood carrying capacity is maintained within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourses. 
11.4.6 	The Commission shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Water Resources Unit of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection prior to approving any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and shall submit copies of such notices to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
11.4.7 	For all applications for permits within the SFHA, the Commission shall: (a) record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with Section 11.4.2 above; (b) review permits to assure that the sites are reasonably free from flooding and require that all State and Federal permits are obtained; and (c) maintain all records pertaining to the special flood hazard area provisions of these Regulations.  (1/1/93) 
11.4.8 	Upon completion of the applicable portion of construction, the applicant shall provide the Commission with verification of the as-built lowest floor elevation, defined as the top of the lowest floor (including basement) or, in the case of flood-proofed buildings, the elevation to which the flood proofing is effective. (1/1/93) 
11.4.9 	Variance Procedure. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for Variances from these SFHA requirements. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. Variances shall meet the following criteria:  (1/1/93) 
a. 	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instances of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and result in the loss of historic designation of the building; (1/1/93) 
36 

Griswold Zoning Regulations 	Revised: December 01, 2018 
b. 	Variances may only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
(iii) 
a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;  (1/1/93) 

c. 	
Any applicant to whom a Variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and  (1/1/93) 

d. 	
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any Variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.   (1/1/93) 


11.5 	Fences. The yard requirements of this ordinance shall not be deemed to prohibit any wall or fence, provided that no wall or fence shall exceed six feet in height above the existing natural grade for any yard or the finished grade of the yard pursuant to an approved site plan by the Commission or unless otherwise permitted in these regulations subject to the limitations of Section 11.6, below.  (8/10/09) 
11.6 	Corner Visibility. On a corner lot in any Residential, Commercial or Industrial district, no fence, wall, hedge or other structure or planting more than three (3) feet in height shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the points which are fifty (50) feet distance from the point of intersection, measured along said street center lines.

B. Maximum Fee; Calculation of Fee. Except as provided in Paragraph C below, no application fee calculated in accordance with the preceding formulae shall exceed $20,000.00. Each applicant for any permit shall provide, at the time of application, the necessary data to permit the calculation of the application fee (such as square footage of buildings or outside storage or active display area requested, the proposed number of lots, or acreage involved in a zone change), and such information shall, where appropriate, be certified by a licensed land surveyor, professional engineer, or registered architect.  Failure to file any application fee set forth in this ordinance shall be grounds for denial, without prejudice, of such application. 
C. 	Additional Reimbursable Costs. 
a. 	
In addition to the fixed fees set forth in subsection A of this section, the commissions may collect payment for direct costs of materials and review services performed by other than town employees, including but not limited to specialized inspections; 

b. 	
third party reviews with professional certifications; 

c. 	
reviews by consultant Town Attorneys; 

d. 	
reviews by consultant Town Professional Engineers; 

e. 	
reviews by licensed Landscape Architects; 

f. 	
reviews by licensed Architects; 

g. 	
reviews by archeologist/cultural resource consultants; 

h. 	
reviews by certified soil scientists, wildlife biologists, or ecologists; 

i. 	
reviews by Licensed Environmental Professionals; 

j. 	
reviews by certified professional in stormwater quality; 

k. 	
legal, stenographic and transcription services associated with any type of land use application. 


The Commission may require an applicant to provide certifications, inspections or professional consultant reports at the applicants expense. It is intended that the fixed fees set forth in subsection A do not cover such costs for additional expenses resulting from non-town staff reviews necessitated by land use applications. These additional expenses will be required where applicable for any permit application before any land use Board or Commission, regardless of whether a public hearing is required.  This section is also applicable to all expenses incurred after an approval is issued in the event that action is needed to enforce compliance with specific conditions of approval or violation of regulations. 
101 

Griswold Zoning Regulations 	Revised: December 01, 2018 
D. Fees Not in Lieu of Bonds. 	The payment of fees shall not prohibit commissions from requiring performance or forfeiture bonds to ensure the successful completion of all work as may be prescribed in the respective land use regulations. 
§144.040 Exemptions 
All boards and agencies of the Town of Griswold, including the use of fire company properties for fire protection purposes, shall be exempt from the payment of fees established pursuant to this chapter. Each board may in whole or in part exempt an application from the payment of any or all fees if said application is for low and moderate income housing or special needs housing.  In addition, each commission shall be authorized, by majority vote, to reduce or waive application fees where (1) the application does not appear, upon initial examination, to require intensive staff review and (2) the applicant is a non-profit entity which qualifies for tax deductible charitable contributions under Regulations of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The commission may also credit all or a portion of application fees from previous application(s) which were denied or withdrawn, where the review work performed on the previous application(s) may be of benefit in reviewing the new application. Any commission exempting an application from payment of a fee, in whole or in part, shall state in the minutes of the meeting at which the plan was received the fee type exempted, the percentage exempt and reasons for granting the exemption.  This exemption shall not prohibit a commission from requiring consultant reports, professional certification or conducting inspection to ensure conformance with land-use regulations. 
§144.050 Payment of fees 
A. Other Fees. The payment of a fee established in accordance with the provision of this chapter shall not relieve the applicant, owner or their agent from the payment of other fees that may be prescribed for a different type of land use application, or by another ordinance of the Town of Griswold. 
B. 	Fees Nonrefundable. All fees received by a commission as part of a land use application submission shall be nonrefundable. 
C. 	Method and Timing of Payment, Failure to Pay.  All Fixed Application Fees shall be paid by cash, check or money order made payable to the Town of Griswold. Fees shall be paid at the time of application submission. The applicant shall be provided with invoices or other evidence of any Additional Expense(s), and reimbursement to the Town shall be made within thirty (30) days after presentation of such invoices or other evidence. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be grounds for denial of any application without prejudice, or revocation of any permit previously issued.  Reimbursement of the Town under this subsection shall be a condition for the endorsement of any plan, the issuance of any final permit, or the issuance of any certificate of zoning compliance for an approved application, or the renewal of any periodic or temporary approval, as the case may be. 
D. 	Post Approval Notices and Fees.   The Town is authorized to place a notice of non-payment of review fees on the land records if any fees from pre-approval or post-approval non-staff reviews are not paid for a period of 90 days. 
§144.060 Periodic Updates of Fee Schedule 
The foregoing fees schedules are based upon an analysis of the expenses incurred, on average, in the processing of land use applications as of the date of passage of this Chapter.  The First Selectman shall periodically examine the expenses incurred by the Town in the processing of land use applications, and shall make recommendations based on input from land use boards and commissions to the Board of Selectmen for adjustments to the foregoing fee schedules based upon current staffing, regulatory requirements, and other relevant factors.

ZONING REGULATIONS 
BOROUGH OF JEWETT CITY, CONNECTICUT 

SECTION 1.  TITLE, AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE 

1.1 	These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the Zoning Regulations, Borough of Jewett City, Connecticut, which herein are called these Regulations, and have been prepared and adopted in accordance with the provision of Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 
1.2 	The purpose of these Regulations is to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values; to lessen congestion in the streets; secure safety from fire, panic, flood and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population and to facilitate the adequate provision for transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements. 
SECTION 2.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
2.1 	Classification of Uses. Uses of land or buildings are classified and regulated by these Regulations as either PERMITTED USES or as SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS. 
2.1.1 	Permitted uses are those which are allowed by right in a zoning district. Applications for permitted uses are submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and are approved by him or by the Planning & Zoning Commission, depending upon the nature of the proposed use. 
2.1.2 	Special Exceptions shall be permitted only after meeting the special provisions of Section 12 of these Regulations. Applications for Special Exceptions shall be submitted to the Planning & Community Development Department and are approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission. 
2.2 	Zoning Permit. No building shall be erected, moved, structurally enlarged or changed to another use or shall any use be established or changed in any area of the Borough of Jewett City without a Zoning Permit therefore from the Zoning Enforcement Officer, issued in conformance with the provisions of these Regulations, except that a written order from the Zoning Board of Appeals in the form of an administrative review or variance shall constitute a Zoning Permit. Uses of land or buildings not clearly permitted in the various zoning districts are prohibited. 
2.2.1 	The Zoning Enforcement Officer is empowered to cause any building or land to be inspected and to order in writing any violation of these Regulations to be corrected or terminated. 
2.2.2 	Application for a Zoning Permit shall be made on a form provided for that purpose and obtainable from either the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Planning & Community Development Department. 
2.2.3 	Applications for permitted single-family and two-family dwellings and accessory buildings or expansions or additions to such buildings on residential lots may be approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer provided they meet the requirements of these Regulations. Applications for all other uses and building shall be reviewed by the Planning & Zoning Commission and shall be submitted together with a site plan as prescribed in Section 13 of these Regulations, to the Planning & Community Development Department at least ten (10) business days prior to a Regular Meeting of the Commission. The Commission shall approve such applications after finding that all aspects of the proposed uses conform to the spirit as well as the letter of these Regulations. 
2.2.4 	It shall be unlawful for any newly erected structure or addition for which a Zoning Permit has been issued to be occupied or used, or for any building or premises or part thereof to be converted or changed from one type of use or occupancy to another until a Certificate of Occupancy has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, stating that the building or premises complies with the provisions of these Regulations. Such certificate shall be issued within ten (10) days after notification from the Permittee that the premises are ready for occupancy if inspection carried out by the Zoning Enforcement Officer subsequent to this notification indicates that approval of the application is warranted. 
2.2.5 	After the effective date of these Regulations, the Zoning Enforcement Officer will issue, without charge, upon request of the owner or occupant, a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any legal, non­conforming building existing on the effective date of these Regulations. 
2.2.6 	All Zoning Permits, Special Exceptions and Variances Shall expire two (2) years after approval unless actual construction shall have started. Special Exceptions shall not expire as long as a document describing the  project that has been signed and filed on the land records of the Town Clerk after any reasonable conditions of approval have been satisfied within 270 days of the approval of this Special Exception.  Those Special Exceptions where this document has not been so filed within the 270 days after approval shall be automatically null and void. Variances granted by Zoning Board of Appeals are associated with the specific land parcel and do not expire if the variance document has been filed on the land records of the Town Clerk. 
2.2.7 	A Certificate of Occupancy shall remain valid only so long as the building, the use thereof, or the use of the land remains in full conformity with these Regulations or of an amendment thereto. 
2.2.8 	Nothing in these Regulations shall require any change in plans, construction or designated use of any building on which construction was begun under a permit issued prior to the effective date of these Regulations. Actual construction is the (a) excavation of a basement, cellar or foundation; (b) actual placing of construction materials in their permanent position fastened in a permanent manner; (c) substantial beginning of demolition and removal of an existing building preparatory to rebuilding; provided, however, in each circumstance that the actual construction shall be diligently carried on until the completion of the building involved. 
2.2.9 	No lot shall be occupied by more than one permitted principle building or use, or group of permitted buildings, such as an apartment project or commercial complex, under the same ownership or sponsorship. 
2.2.10 	All lots shall have frontage on and direct access to a street. 
2.3 	Zoning Map. The map entitled, Zoning Map, Borough of Jewett City, Connecticut, is a part of these Regulations. The Zoning Map shows the boundaries and zoning designation for each district of the Borough. Use and dimensional requirements for each district are found in these Regulations. 
2.3.1 	All district boundaries shown on said Zoning Map follow the outside boundary lines of the land parcel at the effective date of the most current zoning map. 
2.3.2 	Where a district boundary divides a lot of record at the time such boundary line is adopted, the regulations for the less restricted portion of any such lot may extend into the more restricted portion provided that the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district. 
2.3.3 	Where any uncertainty exists as to the correct location of any zoning district boundary shown on the Zoning Map, it shall be the duty of the Planning & Zoning Commission to establish correct location thereof according to the intent of these Regulations. 
2.4 	Building on Existing Lots. Nothing in these Regulations shall prevent construction of a permitted building or the establishment of a permitted use in the relevant zoning district on a lot which, on the effective date of these Regulations and continuously thereafter, was owned separately from an adjoining lot as evidenced by deed recorded in the Land Records of the Borough of Jewett City provided, however, that all requirements regarding height, yards, setbacks, and parking for the appropriate district in which such lot is situated shall be met. 
2.5 	Unspecified Uses. In any case where a use is alleged to be similar to a specified use permitted by these Regulations, its status shall be determined by the Planning & Zoning Commission by reference to the most clearly similar use or uses permitted by these Regulations, or it shall be declared that the use is not similar. When the status of a use has been so determined, such determination shall thereafter have general applicability to all uses of the same type. 
2.6 	Maintenance Not Affected. Nothing in these Regulations shall prohibit the normal maintenance, repair and upkeep of property in any zoning district.

SECTION 1  PREAMBLE 

1.1 	Authority. Pursuant to the authority conferred by Chapter 126 of the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut, the Planning and Zoning Commission adopts these Regulations controlling the subdivision and re-subdivision of land in the Town of Griswold. 
1.2 	Policy. It is declared to be the policy of the Planning and Zoning Commission to consider land subdivision as a part of a plan for the orderly, efficient, and economical development of the Town. This means, among other things, that land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health and safety; that proper provision shall be made for water supply, surface-drainage and sewage disposal, especially in regard to existing or officially proposed municipal utility facilities; that the proposed streets shall be in harmony with existing or officially proposed principal thoroughfares, especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares, and so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs; that, in places deemed proper by the Commission, open spaces for parks and playgrounds shall be shown on the subdivision plan; that undue density of population shall be avoided, especially where development would create an undue burden on municipal facilities; that adequate access to properties for emergency vehicles shall be provided; that adequate light and air shall be afforded to all properties; and that proper provision be made for the control of erosion and sedimentation. 
1.3 	Title. These Regulations shall be known as the Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Griswold, Connecticut, and shall be referred to herein as these Regulations/ 
SECTION 2  OPTIONAL SKETCH PLAN REVIEW 
2.1 	Purpose. The subdivision of land is a complex procedure, usually involving action by several officials and agencies and frequently costing a lot of money. Therefore, persons intending to subdivide land in the Town of Griswold are urged to submit a sketch plan of the land to be subdivided and to discuss their intentions informally with the Commission prior to the preparation of the required plan. Presentation of a sketch plan is at the discretion of the applicant and is intended to ensure that basic requirements can be met prior to incurring engineering, legal and application costs related to the proposed subdivision. The informal review of the sketch plan affords both the Commission and the applicant an opportunity to gain information and raise questions about the subdivision, local regulations and procedures. The sketch plan enjoys no official status, and consent of the Commission with regard to its feasibility in no way implies approval of the formal subdivision plan. No fee or application form is required for the presentation of a sketch plan. 
2.2 	Effect of Optional Sketch Review. Neither the applicant nor the Commission shall be in any way bound by any statement made during the Optional Sketch Review consideration, nor shall the statement of any Commission member be deemed to be an indication of prejudgment or prejudice, it being acknowledged by the applicant that the Commission's responses, like the request itself, are preliminary and subject to further change and refinement. There shall be no vote or other formal action on any request for Optional Sketch Review consideration, other than referrals to other municipal, State, or Federal agencies for review and comment if deemed advisable by the Commission. (8/10/09) 
1 

2.3 	Sketch Plan Contents. The sketch plan should be drawn at a scale of at least one (1) inch equals 100 feet, and should show such information as will enable the Commission to locate the property, determine the physical characteristics of the property, and understand what the applicant proposes to do with the property. At least the following should be shown: 
1. 	
The property boundary and the names of abutting property owners. 

2. 	
Contour information. (These may be simple enlargements of U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps.) 

3. 	
Locations of existing structures, roads, easements, utility rights-of-way, rock outcrops, wetlands and watercourses. 

4. 	
Locations of proposed streets, building lots and open space. 

5. 	
Estimated total acreage of the parcel to be subdivided and the estimated size, in square feet, of each lot. 

6. 	
An indication of the proposed method of providing water supply and sewage disposal. 


2.4 	Commission Review. A presentation of a sketch plan to the Commission may be arranged by contacting the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission or the Zoning Enforcement Officer at least ten (10) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting and requesting that the presentation be placed on the meeting agenda. The Commission shall discuss the proposal with the applicant and shall give its informal comments to the applicant not later than the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission. 
2.5 	Review of "FreeSplit" lot documentation by Zoning Enforcement Officer and/or Town Planner. In order to avoid possible nonconformance to the zoning regulations, or to avoid the creation of illegal lots which would require some subdivision or resubdivision processes under these Regulations, no division of property, by map or deed, should be filed on the land records without compliance with this Section. Owners or their agents should certify by letter, the owner's basis for their entitlement for a "freesplit" designation; and documentation including the status of the land prior to March 1971; and including the dimensions of the current parent parcel and "free split" parcel; and including the owners' or their agent's certification that the division is in compliance with zoning and subdivision regulations. The site plan for any freesplit should not contain any notes indicating "remaining land" or other comparable wording for a parcel that does not comply with the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Griswold and these Regulations. (8/10/09) 
In the event that the status of the land division is unclear, the Planning Commission shall determine whether an existing division of land constitutes a subdivision or resubdivision under authority of Connecticut General Statute Section 826, or upon application to the commission by the owners or their agent. 
2

The regional planning Commission or agencies receiving such referral shall, within thirty-five (35) days report to the Commission and to the applicant its findings on the inter-municipal aspects of the proposed subdivision. If such report of a regional planning Commission is not submitted within thirty-five (35) days after the referral from the Commission, it shall be presumed that such agency does not disapprove of the proposed subdivision. The regional planning Commission's report shall be purely advisory. (8/10/09)

This sheet may form the substance of the temporary stormwater plan for the CTDEP General Permit. (8/10/09) 
4.5.2 	The narrative required in Section 4.5.1(a) may be included on the map of Section 4.5.1(b) if room allows it without affecting readability of the map. The items required to be mapped in Section 4.5.1(b) may be depicted on the subdivision plan map required in Section 4.3 if the readability of the subdivision plan is not affected. 
4.5.3 	After review of the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Commission or its designated agent, the Commission shall vote to certify, modify and certify, or deny that the soil erosion and sediment control plan complies with these Regulations. A vote by the Commission to approve a subdivision plan shall mean certification of the erosion and sediment control plan as well. Prior to certification, any subdivision plan submitted to the Commission may be reviewed by the New London County Soil and Water Conservation District, which may make recommendations concerning such plan, provided such review shall be completed within thirty (30) days of receipt of such plan by the New London County Soil and Water Conservation District. 
4.5.4 	The estimated costs of measures required to control soil erosion and sedimentation, as specified in the certified plan, shall be secured by a partial or full cash bond or other assurance acceptable to the Commission in accordance with the provisions specified under Section 3.7 of these Regulations. 
12 

4.5.5 	The Commission or its designated agent shall periodically conduct inspections to verify compliance with the certified plan and that control measures are properly performed or installed and maintained. The Commission may require the applicant to submit progress reports which show that soil erosion and sediment control measures and facilities have been performed or installed according to the certified plan and are being correctly operated and maintained. 
4.6 	Soil Investigations. Any subdivision or part thereof for which a public sewage disposal system is not available shall be subject to the following requirements: 
4.6.1 	Soil percolation test holes shall be taken as requested by the Director of Health and certified by him to be satisfactory for on-lot sewage disposal. 
4.6.2 	At least two (2) percolation test holes per lot shall be required. Such test holes shall be located not closer than 100 feet from each other. The results of such tests shall be listed in tabular form by lots and made part of the Subdivision Plan. 
4.6.3 	In investigating soil conditions, observation pits may be required to check for ground water, ledge rock, or available good seepage soil below normal depths. 
4.6.4 	Soils must have an acceptable percolation rate, without interference from ground water or impervious strata below the level of the absorption system. The technical standards for determining acceptance shall be the State Sanitary Health Code. 
4.7 	Other Supporting Documents. Before approval of any subdivision, the Commission shall require the following: 
4.7.1 	Evidence of permits for activities that might be controlled by the Griswold Inland Wetlands & Watercourses and Conservation Commission. 
4.7.2 	Where applicable, written statements attesting to the suitability of (1) water and sewer systems from the Jewett City Water Company and Griswold Sewer Authority and/or the Director of Health, and/or the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority under provisions of Section 13 of Special Act 381 (1967), as amended, and (2) all other improvements such as road, drainage and monuments from the First Selectman. 
4.7.3 	The subdivider shall submit to the Commission written copies of all agreements, restrictive covenants, or other documents governing the use, reservation, or maintenance of all land. 
4.7.4 	When the subdivision includes any portion of a watercourse that is located within an A Zone on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for Griswold and the subdivision would result in the alteration or relocation of that watercourse, the applicant shall submit assurance in writing that the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will be maintained. 
4.7.5 	Review letter from State Archeologist. Subdivision or resubdivision site plans, which include more than 10 acres, shall be forwarded by the applicant to the State Archeologist on or before the date of submittal of the application to the commission, with a request for review regarding significant historical or cultural resources which may be located on the parcel to be subdivided. The applicant must submit a copy of their letter with certified mail receipt. 
13 

Before approval, the Applicant shall submit for consideration by the Commission a letter from the State Archeologist with the conclusions or recommendations for site plan revisions to protect real or likely historical or cultural resources, or the results of an investigation by a consulting archaeologist where such investigation is recommended by the State Archeologist. When the applicant demonstrates that the State Archeologist has had thirty days or more to provide such letter, the commission can consider a lack of response as a no effect decision/ (8/10/09) 
4.8 	Re-subdivision Plans. The information required to be submitted under Sections 4.1 through 4.7, above, of these Regulations shall apply to both subdivisions and re-subdivisions, except that for re-subdivisions, the information submitted need not cover that area of the original subdivision unaffected by the re-subdivision. 
SECTION 5  CONVENTIONAL SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 
5.1 	General. The design of the subdivision shall show consideration of and respect for the natural landscape. Designs shall be aimed at fitting the subdivision to the land rather than altering the land to make it fit the subdivision. 
5.2 	Lots. All lots shall front on and provide driveway access to an existing street or one proposed by the subdivision plan. (3/1/05) 
5.2.1 	Wherever possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street and radial to curves and lots shall be generally foursided and largely rectangular in shape consistent with zoning regulations that proscribe a minimum lot width of 100 feet at any point except for a rear lot and a common driveway to a rear lot and contain a net buildable area of 30,000 contiguous square feet. (8/10/09) 
5.2.2 	Lot sizes and street frontage requirements shall conform to the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Griswold. 
5.2.3 	Locations of proposed principal buildings, driveways, water supplies and sewage disposal systems shall be shown on all lots containing wetlands, watercourses, slopes in excess of ten percent (10%), ledge outcrops or shallow to bedrock soils. 
5.2.4 	To the maximum extent possible, lots shall be arranged in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the use of solar energy in buildings subsequently constructed on them. As a general rule, lot arrangement should enable principal buildings to be situated so that their longest axis lies in an east/west direction, so as to expose the front or rear of the building to the south. Attention should be given to ensuring that projected building locations are not shaded by topographic features or by buildings on adjoining properties. 
5.2.5 	Driveways shall be designed so that the final grade does not exceed fifteen percent (15%). Driveways with ten percent (10%) to fifteen percent (15%) grades shall be paved with concrete or bituminous concrete for that portion or portions of the driveway between 10 percent and 15 percent slope with an additional twentyfive (25) feet to be paved on both ends of that driveway segment. (8/10/09) 
14 

5.2.6 	Up to twotiers of rear lots behind the frontage lots, may be proposed only in R60 and R 80 zoning districts. With one tier of rear lots, each rear lot shall have at least a 50-foot access strip to the road frontage. With two tiers of rear lots, a minimum frontage access strip for each lot of 30 feet is required. Rear lots are encouraged to have common driveways whose length for the common portion shall have a maximum length of 1000 feet for 1 and 2 tiers. (8/10/09) 
5.2.7 	All land shall be in the form of zoning compliant lots conforming to the requirements of the underlying zoning district or that have obtained appropriated variances from the Zoning 
oard of !ppeals-there shall be no notes describing lots as remaining land on any 
subdivision site plans. (8/10/09) 
5.3 	Streets. Streets shall be in harmony with existing streets and highways in the Town of Griswold, especially in regard to safe intersections, and shall be constructed to effect the safest possible movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. (3/1/05) 
5.3.1 	All proposed new streets shall connect with one or more approved town streets or state highways, except that any part of an approved subdivision containing more than thirty (30) residential lots shall have at least two (2) points of access. (3/1/05) 
5.3.2 	Streets shall be laid out to provide connections with existing streets on adjacent properties, where appropriate. Consideration shall be given to connecting with future streets on adjacent property where future subdivision appears possible under current zoning and subdivision regulations. (8/10/09) 
5.3.3 (a) 	A dead-end street for subdivisions shall be provided with a circular turn-around area at the closed end. For subdivisions which are being developed in phases, a temporary cul­de-sac shall be provided at the closed end of the dead-end street in each phase of the subdivision. Upon the extension of the dead-end street, or the interconnection of the dead-end street to another street, the temporary cul-de-sac shall be removed and the area which accommodated that portion of the temporary cul-de-sac exterior to the continuation of the street, shall be loamed and seeded in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations. 
For subdivisions in residential districts and containing residential lots, shall have a radius of fifty (50') feet and a paved radius of not less than forty (40') feet. Such streets, in residential districts and containing residential lots, will be permitted only where an alternative street layout is deemed by the Commission to be impractical because of the dimensions, shape or physical condition of the property. 
A dead-end street for residential districts and containing residential lots shall not exceed six hundred (600') feet in length unless it is of a temporary nature; and it is demonstrated to the Commission that it can reasonably be expected to be extended and to interconnect with an existing or proposed road on adjoining land or where it would otherwise be impractical to develop the property; in which event, the Commission may extend the maximum dead-end street length for streets in residential districts containing residential lots to up to one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet. Except as provided in Section 5.3.3(b) hereof, a dead-end street shall not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet. 
15 

Except as provided in Section 5.3.3(b), hereof, no street shall be extended from an existing dead-end street if the farthest point of the new dead-end street exceeds one thousand two hundred, (1,200') feet from a road with an alternative route of access; provided, however, that if this prohibition results in the deprivation of any reasonable development of the subject property to the point that approaches an unconstitutional taking, the Commission may grant a waiver in accordance with Section 8.1 of these Regulations. 
(b) 	
The Commission shall have the right to approve dead-end streets in industrially or commercially zoned subdivisions with industrial and/or commercial lots which exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet in length. In granting such approval, the Commission shall consider the following factors: 

(i) 	
Whether the lots in such subdivision have access to a public water supply for fire suppression purposes, which can be installed in accordance with the technical requirements of the public water system provider; 

(ii) 	
Whether the circular turn-around at the closed end of the dead-end street can accommodate a radius of not less than sixty (60') feet with a paved radius of not less than fifty (50') feet; 


(iii) 	Whether the Commission has received a recommendation from the Town of Griswold Economic Development Commission that the proposed dead-end street length will promote economic development within the Town of Griswold; 
(iv) 	
Whether the Commission has received a review by the senior public safety official of the Town of Griswold indicating that the proposed dead-end street makes adequate provision for access and circulation of emergency vehicles. 

(v) 	
Whether the developer of the proposed dead-end street demonstrates to the Commission that there is a reasonable likelihood that the dead-end street can, in the future, be extended to interconnect with another existing or proposed road or street; and, in conjunction therewith, the subdivider proposes the dedication of an access strip from the termination of the initial phase or phases of the subdivision and extends the dead-end street to the subdivision property line in the final phase for the future road interconnection to the property line of the property being subdivided; and 

(vi) 	
Whether the horizontal and vertical geometry of the proposed dead-end street is sufficient to comply with AASHTO minimum site line requirements for the proposed access intersection for each lot in the subdivision to the dead-end street. 



(c) 	
In subdivisions of industrially or commercially zoned lots which contain dead-end streets which exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet from a road with an alternative route of access, the Commission may require the Applicant to provide an alternative means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles to lots within such subdivision and to reasonably improve any such required emergency access drive to facilitate access by such emergency vehicles to lots within such industrially or commercially zoned subdivision. 

(d) 	
In commercially or industrially zoned subdivisions with industrial and/or commercial lots with dead-end streets, the Commission may require that the Applicant design and obtain approval of a continuation of such dead-end street to a state or municipal road or street in situations in which (i) the Applicant, alone or in combination with other parties filing simultaneous subdivision applications, controls the land required for such future interconnection and (ii) the Commission deems such future interconnection prudent based upon the scope and intended uses of the commercially or industrially zoned subdivision. Where the Applicant does not control the land required for such future interconnection, the Commission may require that the subdivision street be designed to the property line, as described above, and constructed in conjunction with the final phase of the land being subdivided. 

(e) 	
In the design of all cul-de-sacs, the subdivider shall dedicate an easement thirty (30') feet in width and twenty (20') feet in depth to the Town of Griswold at the terminus of the cul-de-sac for snow storage as indicated on Exhibit 5.3 .3a, which easement area shall be granted to the Town of Griswold contemporaneously with the conveyance of the dead-end street to the municipality. In addition, no shrubbery, irrigation system, landscaping other than lawn area, stone wall, fence or other obstruction shall be placed in the area between the pavement edge and the street property line around the entire circumference of a cul-de-sac and this restriction shall be noted on the record subdivision plan for such dead-end streets. 

(f) 	
The Commission shall have the discretion to require, as a component of any subdivision application in which the proposed dead-end street length exceeds one thousand two hundred (1,200') feet, a traffic study performed by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut engaged in the discipline of traffic analysis, determining that the roadway standards proposed in the subdivision application are sufficient to accommodate anticipated traffic generation and turning movements based upon the anticipated build-out of the commercial or industrial subdivision. 

(g) 	
In commercial and/or industrial subdivisions, the Commission shall have the discretion to require street pavement widths for dead-end streets greater than twenty-eight (28') feet but not exceeding thirty-four (34') feet based upon the intended street geometry, trip generation and anticipated uses for the subdivision. 


16 

5.3.4 	The tangent distance between reverse curves shall not be less than fifty (50) feet. Except for intersections and turn-a-rounds on dead-end streets, no curve shall have a radius of less than one hundred (100) feet, as measured radial to the centerline. 
5.3.5 	Except where impractical because of topography or other conditions, streets shall be perpendicular to intersections for a distance of at least one hundred (100) feet. All corners shall be rounded, with a radius of not less than twenty-five (25) feet. Centerlines of alternate side streets shall not be closer than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, measured along the centerline. Wherever a proposed subdivision street intersects with a state highway or major Town road, a minimum sight distance of three hundred fifty (350) feet shall be required in each direction along the state highway or major Town road. 
17 

5.3.6 	If authorized by Statute, whenever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing Town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width and construction set forth in these Regulations or the Road Ordinance of the Town of Griswold, and the Commission determines that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision, as long as the road section within those limits is deemed directly impacted by the creation of the subdivision, the Commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street within those said impacted limits by and at the expense of the subdivider, as long as it is reasonable and necessary to maintain the health and safety of the public, or may disapprove such plan until the Board of Selectmen has authorized expenditures for such improvements.  (3/1/05) (8/10/09) 
5.3.7 	Where such improvement from the centerline is impractical, the Commission may require, if authorized by Statute, improvements of comparable value to be performed along the existing road frontage of the subdivision or adjacent frontage impacted by the subdivision. In the alternative, the Commission may require that the cost of such improvements shall be paid to the Board of Selectmen, or its designated agent, in lieu of the completion of such improvements by the applicant. Such payment shall be held in a separate fund to be used exclusively for the improvement of the subject street in ways, which directly benefit the future owners of lots in the subdivision. (3/1/05) (8/10/09) 
5.3.8 	In making the determinations set forth in the preceding two paragraphs, the Commission 
shall take into account the streets ability to handle the increased volumes of traffic which 
will be generated by the proposed subdivision; the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely to serve the new lots in the subdivision in view of the additional traffic caused by the new subdivision;the drainage conditions of the street and the impact of the new lots and related improvements on the existing stormwater management systems or the need for expansion or improvement of such systems; the impact of proposed driveways on the existing street, including sight lines, drainage impacts, required grading, and safe access; the projected pedestrian traffic from the lots and the anticipated pedestrian improvement between them; and generally the impact of the subdivision on the ability of any vehicle to use the street safely. (3/1/05) 
5.4 	Drainage. An adequate system of stormwater drainage shall be provided and no natural watercourse shall be altered or obstructed in such a way as to reduce the natural runoff capacity unless substitute means of runoff are provided. The developer shall use as guidance the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Stormwater Manual (2004) to manage stormwater flows that result from requested subdivision lot development and road drainage improvements and shall be incorporate any additional requirement that may be included in the Municipal Stormwater Management Plan and resulting ordinances. The developer shall provide additional capacity in adjacent culverts and other drainage features for accommodating increased runoff from the proposed development should it be deemed necessary by the Commission. All existing and proposed drainage systems shall be indicated as to size and location on plans and profile sheets. Drainage rights-of-way through lots shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, and follow property lines wherever possible. The Commission may require culverts and other stormwater drainage installations where it deems necessary, to connect with one or more natural watercourse(s). All necessary easements for drainage shall be provided prior to plan approval. (8/10/09) 
18 

5.5 	Open Space. In accordance with the authority granted in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Commission shall require the provision of open spaces, parks and playgrounds within all conventional subdivisions of five (5) or more lots, according to the following requirements: (3/29/06) 
5.5.1 	Area. When deemed appropriate by the Commission in accordance with Section 5.5, above, the area of dedicated open space within a conventional subdivision shall be ten percent (10%) of the overall gross area of the parcel to be subdivided whether or not it is so subdivided entirely at the time of application. Generally such dedication shall not be less than one acre and shall be of such size and location as deemed appropriate by the Commission.  (3/29/06) (8/10/09) 
5.5.2 	Standards. To the greatest extent possible, dedicated open space(s) shall be contiguous, and separation between open spaces on the subject parcel or other contiguous parcels shall be minimized. In determining the amount and location of open space to be required under this Section, the Commission may consider the entire parcel owned or controlled by the applicant and not just that portion which is the subject of the pending application; and the Commission may allocate open space areas for future subdivision phases when and if they are sought. (3/29/06) 
Where more than ten (10) lots are proposed, the Commission may require that two (2) or more acres be suitable for active recreational use. Such active recreation area shall be graded and drained, if necessary, and seeded to prevent erosion. Areas intended for active recreation shall be so shaped that the greatest dimension is not more than three times than the least dimension. Open spaces intended for public access shall directly abut a public street with a required street frontage of not less than 20 feet. (3/29/06) 
No open spaces intended for natural protection buffers or ornamental purposes shall be filled, excavated, or re-graded; nor shall any vegetation within such area be cut, without specific approval of the Commission, and such land shall be left free and clear of any waste, such as refuse, debris, cut brush, stumps or boulders. Land intended for conservation purposes shall remain in its natural state, unaltered from its condition at the time of subdivision application.  (3/29/06) 
5.5.3 	Fee-in-lieu of Open Space. In accordance with Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended by Public Act 90-239, Section 1, the Commission may authorize a subdivider to pay a fee and/or transfer land to the Town of Griswold in lieu of the disposition of land by one of the methods set forth in Section 7.6.1 of these Regulations. Such authorization may be granted by the Commission and when it determines, in its sole discretion, that there are inadequate areas on the subdivision which merit preservation by one of the methods set forth in Section 7.6.1, or that conditions such as subdivision size, population densities, existing open space in the neighborhood, topography, soils or other characteristics are such that on-site open space is not as desirable as a fee-in-lieu of open space.  (3/29/06) 
5.5.3.1 	Amount. Such fee or combination of fee and the fair market value of land transferred shall be equal to not more than ten percent (10%) of the fair market value of the land to be subdivided prior to the approval of the subdivision. The fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser selected from a list of approved appraisers provided by the Commission. The applicant shall pay directly all appraisal fees and expenses incurred by the applicant and/or the Commission. (3/29/06) (8/10/09) 
19 

5.5.3.2 	Procedure. To employ the fee-in-lieu of open space option, the following procedure shall be used:  (3/29/06) 
a. 	
The applicant, an advisory agency to the Commission, Commission staff, or the Commission itself identify a subdivision where the fee-in-lieu of procedure should be utilized with a brief narrative explaining the reasons for such procedure to be used; (3/29/06) 

b. 	
The Commission shall determine whether to accept the proposal, or to accept a different combination of land transfer and fee, or to require an open space dedication only; (3/29/06) 

c. 	
The Commission and applicant shall jointly select an appraiser to submit a report. Steps a. through c. may be accomplished at the application acceptance portion of the process; (3/29/06) 

d. 	
The applicant shall submit the appraisal during the formal application review process; (3/29/06) 

e. 	
The Commission, as part of the action on the applicant, shall either accept the fee-in-lieu proposal, a combination of fee and land transfer proposal, or require an open space dedication.  (3/29/06) 


5.5.3.3 	Payment. The method of payment of any fees under this Section shall be one of 
the following options a or b as prescribed below. (3/29/06) 
a. 	
The applicant, at his/her option, may submit the entire fee in one lump sum prior to the filing of subdivision Mylars with the Town Clerk; or, (3/29/06) 

b. 	
The applicant may elect to submit a fraction of such payment, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of approved building lots in the subdivision, no later than the time of the sale of each approved building lot; and a restriction executed by the applicant and filed in the land records describing this requirement shall be placed on the final subdivision map filed in the Town Clerk's office. If this option is chosen, the applicant shall submit a cash or passbook bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Town under provision stated in these regulations, equal to the full amount of fee required, prior to the filing of the subdivision maps in the Town Clerk's office. Any required fees shall be paid to the Town prior to the release of this bond.   (3/29/06) (8/10/09) 

c. 	
No building permits shall be issued for any lot in the subdivision until such fractional part is paid for that lot.   (3/29/06) 


5.5.3.4 	Dedicated Fund. Fees submitted under this Section shall be deposited by the Town of Griswold in a fund which shall be used for the purpose of preserving open space or acquiring additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.  (3/29/06) 
20 

5.5.4 	Open Space Waiver. The Commission shall make provisions for open space as set forth in Section 5.5, or authorize a fee-in-lieu of open space for all conventional subdivisions. Waivers of the fee-in-lieu of procedure of Section 5.5.3 shall be granted in the following instances as specifically required by Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes.  (3/29/06) 
5.5.4.1 	Where the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) lots is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first cousin of the property owner for any or no consideration. Such intended transfer shall be evidenced by covenants, restrictions, contracts, or other legally binding documents as the Commission may approve, which documents will be filed in the Land Records along with the Subdivision Plan. If the Commission determines, subsequent to the approval of such subdivision, that such transfers were intended to be temporary, and for the sole purpose of evading the requirements of this Section, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice owing by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records; and (3/29/06) 
5.5.4.2 	Where the subdivision is to contain affordable housing, as defined in Section 8­39a of the Connecticut General Statutes, equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision. Such restrictions for affordable housing shall be evidenced by such documents as the Commission may require, and such restrictions shall run with the lots affected thereby in perpetuity. If, subsequent to approval of the Subdivision, the lots designated for affordable housing shall not be sold for that purpose, the Commission may, following a public hearing with notice by certified mail to the violator, void, in whole or in part, any such subdivision approval, and may cause notice thereof to be filed in the Land Records.  (3/29/06) 
5.6 	Pedestrian Easement. In areas where the proposed street system does not conform to a convenient pattern of pedestrian circulation, particularly in the vicinity of parks, schools, playgrounds, commercial centers, or other semi-public places, the Commission may require the establishment of 10-foot easements for pedestrian ways. Concrete sidewalks four (4) feet in width are encouraged; but in lieu of sidewalks in residential areas, the Commission may require a flat, clear, walkable area on either side or both sides of a town road within the rightofway. This walkable area should, at a minimum, have a four (4) foot paved width graded to provide a route with no more than five (5%) percent change in topography across its width and generally following the horizontal topography of the road rightof way. (8/10/09) 
5.7 	Reserve Strips. Reserve strips of land which, in the opinion of the Commission, shows intent on the part of the subdivider to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall not be permitted. When a subdivision proposes the extension of or the connection to an unimproved reserved street right-of-way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to improve the entire length of said street extension or connection to the adjacent property. (8/10/09) 
21 

5.8 	Flooding Considerations. The Commission shall determine that proposed subdivisions (including manufactured homes subdivisions) are reasonably safe from flooding. When a subdivision is proposed in an ! or !E Zone on the Towns Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated July 18, 2011, or any subsequent revisions thereof, it shall be reviewed to assure the following: (7/11/11) 
5.8.1 	That all proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone areas. 
5.8.2 	That all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electricity and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
5.8.3 	That adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5.8.4 	That new and replacement water supply systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems. 
5.8.5 	That new and replacement sanitary sewer systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system or discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
5.8.6 	That on-site sewage disposal systems are located to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. 
5.8.7 	That the flood-carrying capacity is maintained within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourse. 
5.8.8 	That all applications for subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include with such applications base flood elevation data for that portion of the development located within the SFHA. (7/11/11) 
5.9 	Floodway Encroachments. Within the floodway, designated on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map for the Town of Griswold, dated July 18, 2011, or any subsequent revision thereof, a copy of which is on file with the Commission, all encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements to existing structures, and other development, are prohibited unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut registered professional engineer is proved by the applicant demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during a 100-year flood. (7/11/11) 
SECTION 6  CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 
6.1 	General. These conservation subdivision regulations are intended to provide flexibility in the placing of residential units on areas of a proposed site best suited for development and to protect the remaining land as open space. Proposed building lots shall be of such shape, size, location, topography, and character that buildings can be constructed reasonably, occupied, and used for building purposes without danger to the health, safety and general welfare of the occupants and the public. The amount of disturbance such as site grading, vegetative and rock wall removal shall be minimized insofar as practicable to preserve worthy land characteristics and lessen the likely impact on environmental systems such as areas of steep topography, significant wetland areas, 
22 

groundwater, watercourses, and vegetative and wildlife communities. Proposed building lots shall be designed and arranged to make the best use of the natural terrain, to avoid unnecessary regrading, to protect the natural environment, to preserve natural features such as stonewalls, ridge lines, water bodies, watercourses and vegetation, and to preserve existing significant historical or cultural features. Conservation subdivision design standards shall apply only to single-family residential subdivision. This section is adopted pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 8­25(c) and is intended to adopt some of those provisions for cluster subdivisions/ (8/18/05) (8/10/09) 
6.1.1 	Findings: The Commission finds that in some cases the strict adherence to traditional land development and subdivision techniques within the Town of Griswold may result in: 
6.2 	Allowable Density. The determination for the number of allowable lots in a conservation subdivision shall be determined by a density yield plan as prescribed in Section 6.2.1, below. 
6.2.1 	Density Yield Plan. The determination for the number of allowable lots in a conservation subdivision shall be determined by a conventional subdivision plan, produced under the signature and seal of a Connecticut licensed design professional, which demonstrates compliance to the satisfaction of the Commission with all the applicable requirements for conventional subdivisions as prescribed in Section 5 of these Regulations. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the building lots shown on the Density Yield Plan shall demonstrate compliance with public health code requirements. 
6.2.2 	Bonus lots. Where 34 percent or more of lots of the existing or proposed road frontage is within a dedicated open space area and that 34 % is at least 200 feet in depth; and where 34 percent or more of the subdivision acreage is dedicated to open space, then the conservation subdivision shall be granted one (1) additional bonus lot beyond the number of lots estimated by the density yield plan. (8/10/09) 
6.3 	Lots. All lots shall front on, and provide driveway access to a street, which meets the standards of the Road Ordinance of the Town of Griswold as revised from time to time. (8/10/09) 
6.3.1 	Wherever possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street and radial to curves and lots shall be generally foursided and largely rectangular in shape and consistent with zoning regulation that proscribe a minimum lot width of 100 feet at any point except a driveway / common driveway to a rear lot and a minimum net buildable area of 30,000 contiguous square feet not containing watercourses, wetland soils, topographic slopes over twenty (20%) percent. (8/10/09) 
6.3.2 	All land shall be in the form of lots or in proposed open space. No notes suggesting "remaining land" shall appear on the subdivision plans. (8/10/09) 
6.3.3 	Dimensional requirements for lots in a conservation subdivision shall conform to the minimum requirements as shown below. 
Minimum lot size 40,000 square feet Minimum street frontage 150 feet Minimum front yard setback 50 feet Minimum side and rear yard setback 30 feet Maximum lot coverage 20 % Maximum building height 35 feet 
23 

6.3.4 	Locations of proposed principal buildings, driveways, water supplies and sewage disposal systems shall be shown on all lots. 
6.3.5 	To the maximum extent possible, lots shall be arranged in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the use of solar energy in buildings subsequently constructed on them. As a general rule, lot arrangement should enable principal buildings to be situated so that their longest axis lies in an east/west direction, so as to expose the front or rear of the building to the south. Attention should be given to ensuring that projected building locations are not shaded by topographic features or by buildings on adjoining properties. 
6.3.6 	Driveways shall be designed so that the final grade does not exceed fifteen percent (15%). Driveways with ten percent (10%) to fifteen percent (15%) grades shall be paved with concrete or bituminous concrete for that portion or portions of the driveway ten percent (10%) or greater in grade. Portions of driveways requiring paving shall be shown on subdivision lot site plans at a scale of 1 inch to 40 feet with an additional 25 feet paved on both ends of a driveway segment with a slope between 10 percent and 15 percent. 
6.3.7 	Lots located within a conservation subdivision shall, upon approval and recording of the final plans, be noted for zoning purposes as being part of a conservation subdivision (e.g. R­80(C); R-60(C), and thereafter be regulated by the dimensional requirements of the R-40 zoning district, as established in Section 10 of the Griswold Zoning Regulations. 
6.3.8 	Rear lots with lot area that is 1 1/2 times the requirement of frontage lot in the underlying zone may be approved in no more than two tiers behind the frontage lots with an access strip consisting of a minimum of 30 feet frontage on the town or state road, with common driveways being encouraged to serve no more than four (4) lots to a maximum length of 1000 feet, with a minimum ratio of frontage to rear lots of 2:5 where permitted by the geometry of the parcel. Minimum rear lot area shall be determined as the area of the lot wider than 100 feet, i.e., not counting the access strip for any portion of the driveway. In laying out rear lots, the applicant is encouraged to use the natural terrain, to avoid unnecessary regrading, to protect the natural environment, and to preserve existing significant historical or cultural features. (8/10/09) 
6.4 	Streets. Streets shall be in harmony with existing streets and highways in the Town of Griswold, especially in regard to safe intersections, and shall be constructed to effect the safest possible movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
6.4.1 	All proposed streets shall connect with one or more approved Town streets or state highways, except that any part of a subdivision containing more than thirty (30) residential lots shall have at least two (2) points of access. 
6.4.2 	Streets shall be laid out to provide connections with existing streets on adjacent properties, where appropriate. Consideration shall be given to connecting with future streets on adjacent property where future subdivision appears probably. 
6.4.3 	A dead-end street shall be provided with a circular turn around area at the closed end having a paved radius of at least forty (40) feet. Such streets will be permitted only where an alternative street layout is deemed by the Commission to be impractical because of the dimensions, shape or physical conditions of the property. A dead-end street shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length unless it is of a temporary nature and is planned for extension and can reasonably be expected to connect with an existing or proposed road on adjoining land or where it would otherwise be impossible to develop the property. In no 
24 

case shall a dead-end street exceed 1,200 feet. No street shall be extended from an existing dead-end street if the farthest point of the new dead-end exceeds 1,200 feet from a road with an alternative route of access. 
6.4.4 	The tangent distance between reverse curves shall not be less than fifty (50) feet. Except for intersections and turn-a-rounds on dead-end streets, no curve shall have a radius of less than one hundred (100) feet, as measured radial to the centerline. 
6.4.5 	Except where impractical because of topography or other conditions, streets shall be perpendicular to intersections for a distance of at least one hundred (100) feet. All corners shall be rounded, with a radius of not less than twenty-five (25) feet. Centerlines of alternate side streets shall not be closer than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, measured along the centerline. Wherever a proposed subdivision street intersects with a state highway or a major town road, a minimum sight distance of three hundred fifty (350) feet shall be required in each direction along the state highway or major town road. 
6.4.6 	If authorized by Statute, wherever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved street or an existing Town street which does not conform with minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width and construction set forth in these Regulations or the Road Ordinance of the Town of Griswold, and the Commission determines that approval of the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such street was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision or beyond the limits of the proposed subdivision, as long as the road section within those limits is deemed directly impacted by the creation of the subdivision, the Commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street within those said impacted limits by and at the expense of the subdivider, as long as it is reasonable and necessary to maintain the health and safety of the public, or may disapprove such plan until the Board of Selectmen has authorized expenditures for such improvements.  (3/1/05) (8/10/09) 
6.4.7 	In making the determinations set fourth in the preceding two paragraphs, the Commission 
shall take into account the streets ability to handle the increased volumes of traffic which 
will be generated by the proposed subdivision; the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the street safely to serve the new lots in the subdivision in view of the additional traffic caused by the new subdivision; the drainage conditions of the street and the impact of the new lots and related improvements on the existing stormwater management systems or the need for expansion or improvement of such systems; the impact of proposed driveways on the existing street, including sight lines, drainage impacts, required grading, and safe access; the projected pedestrian traffic from the lots and the anticipated pedestrian improvement between them; and generally the impact of the subdivision on the ability of any vehicle to use the street safely. (3/1/05) 
6.5 Drainage. It shall be the policy in these regulations that stormwater management resulting from development of lots, roads, and drainage improvements should be consistent with the guidelines of the CTDEP Stormwater Manual of 2004 as amended from time to time. To reduce long term maintenance of roads and drainage structures, the Commission may encourage drainage swales and curbless roads where these measures have been shown to be effective and reduce town maintenance costs for the catch basins, piping and curbs to be installed only when higher slope, stormwater volume or soil infiltration characteristics preclude the preferred curbless, swaled road design. An adequate system of stormwater drainage shall be provided and no natural watercourse shall be altered or obstructed in such a way as to reduce the natural runoff capacity unless 
25 

substitute means of runoff are provided. The developer shall provide additional capacity in adjacent culverts and other drainage features for accommodating increased runoff from the proposed development should it be deemed necessary by the Commission. All existing and proposed drainage systems shall be indicated as to size and location on plans and profile sheets. Drainage rights-of-way through lots shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, and follow property lines, wherever possible. The Commission may require culverts and other storm drainage installations where it deems necessary, to connect with one or more natural watercourses. All necessary easements for drainage shall be provided prior to plan approval. (8/10/09) 
6.6 	Open Space. The Commission shall require dedicated open space for all conservation subdivisions, according to the following requirements: 
6.6.1 	The minimum area of dedicated open space within a conservation subdivision shall be at least one-third (34%) of the overall gross area of the parcel to be subdivided. The gross area of the parcel to be subdivided shall be characterized as percent buildable and percent non buildable according to definitions in Section 10. (8/10/09) 
6.6.2 	To the greatest extent possible, dedicated open space(s) shall be contiguous, and separation between open spaces minimized. Open space offered should consist of a variety of front and rear land whose characteristics in total reflect the percentages of buildable versus non buildable land in the total parcel to be subdivided. (8/10/09) 
6.6.3 	Where eight (8) or more lots are proposed, the Commission may require that two (2) or more acres be suitable for active recreational use. Such active recreation area shall be graded and drained, if necessary, and seeded to prevent erosion. Areas intended for active recreation shall be so shaped that the average greatest dimension is not more than three times than the average lesser dimension. (8/10/09) 
6.6.4 	All open spaces shall directly abut a public street with a required street frontage not less than 100 feet. (8/10/09) 
6.6.5 	No open spaces intended for natural protection buffers or ornamental purposes shall be filled, excavated, or regraded, nor shall any vegetation within such area be cut, without specific approval of the Commission, and such land shall be left free and clear of any waste, such as refuse, debris, cut brush, stumps or boulders. Land intended for conservation purposes shall remain in its natural state, unaltered from its present condition at the time of subdivision application. 
6.6.6 	Lands proposed as dedicated open space within a conservation subdivision that are used for a bona fide agricultural purpose at the time of subdivision approval may be continued to be used as such, though no agricultural use employed on dedicated open space may be expanded or intensified by the owner or lessee of said open space. Expansion shall mean the development, clearing, or physical alteration of open space lots or portions thereof which are not used for bona fide agricultural purposes at the time of subdivision application, and shall be prohibited. Intensification shall mean an increase in the number of buildings other structures, the number of cattle grazed, or a change in the nature of the agricultural use from that employed at the time of subdivision application and shall be prohibited. The harvest of timber and/or the extraction of gravel and earth products shall not be considered a bona fide agricultural use as allowed by this section. 
26 

As an information statement to future lot owners, a note will be added to the subdivision site plan for lots adjacent to active farms stating that active agricultural activity on the adjacent lot may occasionally create odors or dust associated with it and that there is a Right to Farm law in Connecticut. (8/10/09) 
6.6.7 	Proof, in accordance with Section 7.6 of these Regulations and to the satisfaction of the Commission, shall be provided to the Commission prior to the endorsement of final Mylars, that the land identified as open space has been protected in perpetuity from development or any other use not specifically allowed by these Regulations. 
6.6.8 	The Commission may require an applicant to provide a written recommendation from the Griswold Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Conservation Commission (IW&WCC) regarding the most appropriate location and/or use of proposed open space(s). 
6.7 	Pedestrian Easement. In areas where the proposed street system does not conform to a convenient pattern of pedestrian circulation, particularly in the vicinity of parks, schools, playgrounds, commercial centers, or other semi-public places, the Commission may require the establishment of 10-foot easements for pedestrian ways. Concrete sidewalks four (4) feet in width are encouraged; but in lieu of sidewalks in residential areas, the Commission may require a flat, clear, walkable area on either side or both sides of a town road within the rightofway. This walkable area should, at a minimum, have a four (4) foot paved width graded to provide a route with no more than five (5%) percent change in topography across its width and generally following the horizontal topography of the road rightof way. (8/10/09) 
6.8 	Reserve Strips. Reserve strips of land which, in the opinion of the Commission, shows intent on the part of the subdivider to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall not be permitted. When a subdivision proposes the extension of or the connection to an unimproved reserved street right-of-way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to improve the entire length of said street extension or connection to the adjacent property line. (8/10/09) 
6.9 	Flooding Considerations. The Commission shall determine that proposed subdivisions (including manufactured home subdivisions) are reasonably safe from flooding. When a subdivision is proposed in A or AE zones on the Towns Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 18, 2011, or any subsequent revisions thereof, it shall be reviewed to assure the following: (7/11/11) 
6.9.1 	That all proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone areas. 
6.9.2 	That all public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electricity and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
6.9.3 	That adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
6.9.4 	That new and replacement water supply systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems. 
6.9.5 	That new and replacement sanitary sewer systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system or discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
27 

6.9.6 	That on-site sewage disposal systems are located to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. 
6.9.7 	That the flood-carrying capacity is maintained within any altered or relocated portion of any watercourse. 
6.9.8 	That all applications for subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include with such applications base flood elevation data for that portion of the development located within the SFHA. (7/11/11) 
6.10 	Floodway Encroachments. Within the floodway, designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for the Town of Griswold, dated July 18, 2011, or any subsequent revision thereof, a copy of which is on file with the Commission, all encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements to existing structures, and other development, are prohibited unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a Connecticut registered professional engineer is provided by the applicant demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during a 100-year flood. (7/11/11) 
SECTION 7  IMPROVEMENTS 
7.1 	Streets. Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the Town of Griswold Road Ordinance. 
7.1.1 	The applicant will place easily identifiable stakes at even one hundred (100) foot stations along the centerlines of proposed streets prior to submission of the subdivision plan to facilitate evaluation of the plan by the Commission and the Board of Selectmen. 
7.2 	Drainage. Drainage features shall encourage, where appropriate, nonstructural stormwater best management techniques as outlined in the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Stormwater Management Manual (2004) or as amended; and shall be in accordance with Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges and Incidental Construction, Form 815 of the Connecticut Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided by these Regulations or other applicable ordinances of the Town of Griswold. (8/10/09) 
7.3 	Monuments and Markers. Stone or reinforced concrete monuments shall be placed at all points of curvature or tangency, at all angle points on the street lines and at one front corner of each lot. Iron pipes or pins shall be placed at all other lot corners or angle points. 
7.3.1 	Monuments shall be not less than four (4) inches square and thirty (30) inches long with a brass or copper plug, drill hole or cross marking the center of the monument. They shall be set flush with or slightly above finished grade. Iron pipes shall be at least one-half (1/2) inch nominal inside diameter and thirty-six (36) inches long. The top of the pipes or pins shall normally be at least two (2) inches above finished grade. 
7.4 	Street Signs. Street signs are required at all intersections. Four-way intersections shall have two (2) sign posts located on diagonally opposite corners. T-intersections shall have one signpost. Each signpost shall identify both intersecting streets. 
28 

7.4.1 	The Town of Griswold shall prepare and install all street signs; however, the cost of preparation and installation shall be borne by the developer pursuant to applicable Town Fee Ordinance. (8/10/09) 
7.5 	Utilities. All utility lines will be located underground except that the Commission may approve overhead electrical and telephone lines in subdivisions not involving new streets or where physical conditions make underground installation impractical. Adequate conduit, which is considered to be at least one (1) inch diameter PVC, shall be installed with underground electric utilities to provide for future street lights. The Commission may permit overhead lines to be extended along a proposed street if such street is an extension of an existing street which has overhead lines and such extension involves a distance less than the existing street length. (9/28/90) 
7.5.1 	Water supply and distribution systems shall be installed in accordance with the specifications of the Jewett City Water Company or the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority or the Connecticut Department of Health, whichever has jurisdiction. 
7.5.2 	All sewage shall be disposed of by methods approved by the Connecticut Departments of Environmental Protection or Health, in accordance with Section 19-13-B20 of the Connecticut Health Code. 
7.6 	Open Space.

(1/26/90) (8/10/09) (03/21/2013) 
SECTION 8  WAIVERS 
8.1 	Waivers. The Commission may waive a requirement of these Regulations, in whole or in part, by a three-quarters vote of all the members of the Commission in cases where conditions exist which affect the subject land and which are not generally applicable to other land in the area, except that no waiver shall be granted that would have a significant adverse affect on adjacent property or on public health and safety. No waiver shall be granted unless one of the following conditions exist: 
8.1.1 	The proposed subdivision includes land in more than one municipality.

SECTION 1. Title and Authority 
(a) 	
Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and opportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and increasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have been contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address this problem, Connecticut has established the Aquifer Protection Area Program (Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply aquifers and to protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires coordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and water companies to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations. It is therefore the purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the Town of Griswold by making provisions for: 

(1) 	
implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb (the Act); 

(2) 	
delineating aquifer protection areas on the city/town zoning or inland wetland and watercourse areas maps; 

(3) 	
regulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area including: prohibiting certain new activities; registering existing regulated activities; and issuing permits for new regulated activities at registered facilities; and 

(4) 	
administering and enforcing these regulations. 



(b) 	
These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the "APA Regulations") of the Town of Griswold. 

(c) 	
These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies §22a-354i-1 through §22a-354i-10. 

(d) 	
The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses & Conservation Commission of the Town of Griswold is established as the Aquifer Protection Agency (the "Agency") in accordance with the "Ordinance for the Establishment of an Aquifer Protection Agency," (the "APA Ordinance") Chapter 6 effective 10/14/2004, and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the APA Ordinance and the Act. 

(e) 	
The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or deny registrations, issue permits, issue permits with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in aquifer protection areas in the Town of Griswold pursuant to the Act.
