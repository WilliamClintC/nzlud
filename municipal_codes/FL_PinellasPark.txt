PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pinellas Park, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1961 Code, as supplemented through October 1, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of each chapter of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter and article. Thus, the second section of article 1 of chapter 1 is numbered 1-102, and the first section of article 2 of chapter 6 is 6-201. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-101 and 6-102 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-101.5. New chapters, articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT1:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Please note that each chapter has an individual code comparative table, and as such, the chapter number is represented within the prefix. For example, the prefix for the code comparative table for chapter 1 would be CCT1:1. 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Stephanie Turnau, Editor, and MaLinda Franklin, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Diane Corna, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

1.  Certificate of clerk. Within twenty (20) days after the initiative petition or referendum petition is filed the City Clerk or other official designated by the Council shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency, specifying, if it is insufficient, the particulars wherein it is defective and shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the petitioners' committee by registered mail. A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners' committee files a notice of intention to amend it with the Clerk or other official designated by the Council within two (2) working days after receiving the copy of the certificate and files a supplementary petition upon additional papers within ten (10) days after receiving the copy of such certificate. Such supplementary petition shall comply with the requirements of Section CC-309. Within five (5) working days after it is filed, the Clerk or other official designated by the Council shall complete a certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition as amended and promptly send a copy of such certificate to the petitioners' committee by registered mail as in the case of the original petition. If a petition or amended petition is certified sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition is certified insufficient, and the petitioners' committee does not elect to amend or request Council review under Subsection CC-309(D)(4) of this Section within the time required, the Clerk or other official designated by the Council shall promptly present his certificate to the Council, and the certificate shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
2.  Council review. If a petition has been certified insufficient and the petitioners' committee does not file notice of intention to amend it or if an amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within two (2) working days after receiving the copy of such certificate, file a request that it be reviewed by the Council. The Council shall review the certificate at its next meeting following the filing of such request, and approve or disapprove it, and the Council's determination shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(F)  Referendum petitions; suspension of effect of Ordinances. When a referendum petition is filed with the City Clerk or other official designated by the Council, the operation of the Ordinance sought to be reconsidered shall be automatically suspended. Such suspension shall terminate when: 
1.  There is a final determination of insufficiency of petition, or; 
2.  The petitioners' committee withdraws the petition, or; 
3.  The Council repeals the Ordinance, or; 
4.  A vote of the electors of the City on the Ordinance has been certified. 
(G)  Action on petitions. 
1.  Action by council. When an initiative or referendum petition has been finally determined sufficient, the Council shall promptly consider the proposed initiative Ordinance in the manner provided in Subsection CC-308(C), or reconsider the referred Ordinance by voting its repeal. If the Council fails to adopt a proposed initiative Ordinance without any change in substance within sixty (60) days, or fails to repeal the referred Ordinance within thirty (30) days, it shall submit the proposed or referred Ordinance to the voters of the City.

The purpose of enacting an Article to establish a fund for reimbursing employees of the City of Pinellas Park, for Attorney's fees expended in the successful defense of criminal prosecution arising from action taken in the course of performing their official duties and while in the scope of their employment is: 
(A)  To guarantee that the City be able to attract, hire and retain qualified employees, agents and officials; that providing a fund for reimbursement of such legal fees is necessary to insure the attraction and retention of qualified individuals to serve as employees, agents or officials of the City of Pinellas Park; that to attract employees of the highest quality, it is necessary to provide them with assurances that should they wrongfully be subject to criminal prosecution arising from action taken while performing their official duties and furthering the business of the citizens of Pinellas Park that they will be reimbursed by the City for actions taken in good faith in its behalf; 
(B)  To insure fundamental fairness to all City employees, agents and officers; that the employee, agent or official, having been found innocent of wrongdoing, or having been discharged from prosecution, has been vindicated of any wrongdoing, and it is unfair and inequitable that such employee, agent or official should have to bear the heavy financial burden of Attorney's fees incurred while acting in his official capacity, in furtherance of the business of the citizens of Pinellas Park, and while in the scope of his employment; 
(C)  To insure freedom of action; that reimbursement of such Attorney's fees is necessary to insure freedom of action by City employees, agents or officials; that such reimbursement will allow each employee, agent or official to more fully perform his lawful duties, since he need not fear consequences arising from the lawful exercise of such duties; 
(D)  To maintain the good image and integrity of the City of Pinellas Park. The City's image and integrity are directly benefited by the vindication of any employee, agent or official from wrongdoing arising from action taken while acting in the course of his employment and while in furtherance of his official duties and the business of Pinellas Park. Vindication of City employees, agents or officers is a subject of great interest to the City, and reimbursement of such attorney's fees is an incentive to City employees, agents or officers to successfully defend prosecution wrongfully brought against them. 
(Ord. No. 739, 8-14-1975)

(F)  Reimbursement of Attorney's fees out of the fund herein created shall not be made if payment of such Attorney's fees is otherwise payable under an insurance policy providing for such reimbursement or payment. 
(Ord. No. 739, 8-14-1975)  
Sec. 2-1103. - Reimbursement of attorney's fees for criminal defense.

The petition shall be considered by each Councilman, and voting thereon shall take place at the next regular meeting. If a majority of the City Council shall determine that such Attorney's fees were incurred defending a criminal prosecution arising out of his official duties and in furtherance of City business, and that such employee, agent or official was acting in the scope of his authority and employment and otherwise meets the requirements of this article, then such employee, agent or official shall be reimbursed for all such reasonable Attorney's fees. If the Council by majority vote, shall determine that such Attorney's fees are unreasonable, then the Council shall award an amount which it determines to be reasonable.

2.  The Code Enforcement Board shall hold at least one (1) regular meeting every year. Special Magistrates shall convene once each month, but may meet more often or less often as the demand necessitates upon the approval or request of the City Manager or his/her designee. 
3.  The Code Enforcement Board and Special Magistrates may, at any properly noticed hearing, set a future hearing date.

Each case before the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate shall be presented by legal counsel and/or the one (1) or more Community Compliance Specialists or other City employees who are charged with the responsibility for inspection and/or enforcement of the specific Code sections alleged to have been violated. If the local governing body prevails in prosecuting a case before the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case. 
7.  All alleged violators who have failed to timely correct the violation, shall appear before either the Code Enforcement Board or a Special Magistrate, whichever the City Manager or his/her designee deems appropriate based upon the circumstances of the case, to respond to the charges. If the alleged violator appears before a Special Magistrate and wishes to contest the violation, the Special Magistrate shall refer the matter to the Code Enforcement Board for hearing. If the alleged violator has been properly noticed and fails to appear at a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate, the Board or Special Magistrate shall proceed with the hearing and the notice shall so state. If the absent alleged violator is found guilty of the violation, or if the violator appears and admits the violation, the Board or Special Magistrate shall issue an order giving the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation(s) which order shall contain appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. In the event the violator fails to timely correct the violation(s) as ordered by the Board or Special Magistrate, the Board or Special Magistrate may assess an appropriate fine against the violator. If the Board or Special Magistrate assesses a fine against the violator for failing to timely correct the violation(s), an Administrative Fine Order shall be entered with appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. The provisions of Subsection 2-1208(D) shall apply to said order. A request for termination of such fine shall be heard by the Board or Special Magistrate. 
8.  The Code Enforcement Board and the Special Magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day; provided, however, that the Code Enforcement Board and Special Magistrates may in its discretion continue any case until the next or a future agenda upon a showing of good cause at the time of or prior to the scheduled hearing. The Code Enforcement Board and the Special Magistrate shall take testimony from the Community Compliance Specialist(s) or other City employees, the alleged violator, and any other witnesses. Both sides shall have a right to give testimony, present witnesses, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses, in person or through their attorney. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. 
9.  After the conclusion of the hearing, the Code Enforcement Board and the Special Magistrate shall issue findings of fact based on the evidence of record, and conclusions of law, and shall issue an Order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein. The finding shall be by an Order entered by the Special Magistrate or motion approved by a majority of those board members present and voting, except that at least four (4) of those members of the Code Enforcement Board must vote for the action to be official. The Order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in Subsection 2-1208(A), the cost of repairs may be included, along with the fine, if the Order is not complied with by said date. 
A certified copy of an Administrative Fine Order shall be recorded in the Public Records of Pinellas County and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an Order is recorded in the Public Records pursuant to this Subsection and the violation(s) are later corrected, the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate shall issue a Termination of Fine Order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the Public Records.

Sec. 2-1207. - Enforcement procedure. 
(A)  It shall be the duty of the Community Compliance Specialists or other City employees who are charged with code enforcement responsibilities to initiate enforcement proceedings of any of the codes or ordinances in force in the City of Pinellas Park; no members of the Board or Special Magistrates shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(B)  If a violation of any of the codes or ordinances in force in the City of Pinellas Park is found, except in the case of a repeat violation, the Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee shall notify the violator and give him/her a reasonable time to correct the violation. At the same time, the Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee shall provide written notice, as herein provided, to the violator of the date, time and place of the hearing on the violation. If the violation is corrected and then recurs, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee, the case may be presented to the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. The notice shall also state that if the alleged violator fails to appear, that the hearing will still take place in his or her absence. 
(C)  At a hearing before the Special Magistrate, if the alleged violator fails to appear or admits the violation, the procedure contained in Section 2-1205(B)7 shall be followed. If the alleged violator wishes to contest the violation(s), the Special Magistrate, through his or her clerical staff, shall refer the case to the Code Enforcement Board for hearing. The Code Enforcement Board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and written notice of such hearing shall be provided to the alleged violator, as provided for herein. At the option of the Code Enforcement Board, notice may additionally be served by publication and posting. If the violation is corrected and then recurs, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee, the case may be presented to the Code Enforcement Board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the Board hearing and the notice shall so state. 
The notice shall also state that if the alleged violator fails to appear, that the hearing will still take place in his or her absence. 
(D)  If an alleged repeat violation is found, the Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee shall notify the violator of same, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The Community Compliance Specialist or other City employee, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall at the same time provide written notice, as herein provided, to the violator of the date, time and place of the hearing on the violation. The case may be presented to the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
If the repeat violator wishes to contest the alleged repeat violation at a Special Magistrate Hearing, the Special Magistrate shall refer the case to the Code Enforcement Board for hearing and a hearing shall be scheduled and written notice thereof provided to the violator as provided herein. If the alleged repeat violator has been properly noticed and fails to appear before the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate, the Board or Special Magistrate may proceed with the hearing. If the alleged repeat violator is found guilty of the violation, or appears and admits the repeat violation, the Board or Special Magistrate may impose an appropriate fine as provided for herein and an order with appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be entered. The provisions of Subsection 2-1208(D) shall apply to said order. A request for termination of said fine shall be heard by the Board or Special Magistrate. All notices required in this paragraph shall state that if the alleged violator fails to appear, that the hearing will still take place in his or her absence. 
(E)  If the Community Compliance Specialist has reason to believe that a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the Community Compliance Specialist shall make a reasonable effort to notify the alleged violator of the violation and of the hearing and may immediately notify the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate and request a hearing. The Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate shall conduct a hearing to determine if a violation exists and may enter appropriate orders. 
(F)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, Special Magistrate or court, sells or otherwise transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
1.  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
2.  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleading, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
3.  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceedings. 
4.  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within 5 days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in this section before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 1136, 1-14-1982; Ord. No. 1823, 1-26-1989; Ord. No. 1960, 2-22-1990; Ord. No. 2073, 4-25-1991; Ord. No. 2328, 4-27-1995; Ord. No. 2419, 2-27-1997; Ord. No. 3662, § 7, 1-8-2009)  
Sec. 2-1208. - Administrative fines; liens. 
(A)  The Code Enforcement Board and a Special Magistrate, as the case may be, upon notification by the Community Compliance Specialist that an order of the Code Enforcement Board or the Special Magistrate, as the case may be, has not been complied with by the set time, or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine as specified herein for each day the violation continues past the date set by the Code Enforcement Board or the Special Magistrate, as the case may be, for compliance, or in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the Community Compliance Specialist. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in Subsection 2-1207(E), the Enforcement Board shall notify the local governing body which may take all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance, and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs, along with the fine imposed pursuant to this Section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. A fine imposed pursuant to this Section shall not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation and in addition, may include all cost of repairs pursuant to this subsection. The order setting the date for compliance shall state that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date. However, if the Code Enforcement Board, or the Special Magistrate, as the case may be, finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. 
(B)  In determining the amount of fine, if any, the Code Enforcement Board and Special Magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The gravity of the violation; 
2.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
3.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(C)  City Council may, at a public hearing, reduce or eliminate a fine or lien imposed by the Code Enforcement Board or a Special Magistrate pursuant to this Article. The Code Enforcement Board or a Special Magistrate may make a recommendation to the City Council to reduce or eliminate a fine or lien imposed by it pursuant to this Article when a request application is received by the City Manager or his/her designee. A request to reduce or eliminate a fine or lien, shall not be considered until such time as the violation for which the fine has been assessed has been corrected. In recommending or in determining whether to reduce or eliminate any such fine or lien, City Council, the Code Enforcement Board, or Special Magistrate as the case may be shall consider the nature and extent of the violation, the length of time that the violation existed, the impact of the violation upon the community, the ability of the violator to eliminate the violation, actions taken by the violator to correct the violation, previous violations committed by the violator, and the cost to the City in processing the case and in obtaining compliance. 
(D)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine shall be recorded in the Public Records of Pinellas County, Florida, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. A fine imposed pursuant to this Article shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance, until the City Manager or his/her designee makes an administrative decision to discontinue fine accrual, or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this Section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this Section runs in favor of City Council and the City Council may execute a satisfaction or release of lien or a partial satisfaction or partial release of lien entered pursuant to this Section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the City Council may authorize the City Attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this Article may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. Any person found guilty or responsible for any ordinance infraction or violation shall be liable for all court costs, all costs incurred by the City in prosecuting the case, any fine imposed, any reasonable cost of repairs, all costs incurred by the City in enforcing its codes and all costs of repairs related thereto, an administrative charge or fee in the amount of Seventy-Five Dollars ($75.00), post judgment interest at the legal rate of interest as established by the State of Florida Comptroller, and any other costs or fee imposed involving a debt owed, including all costs and reasonable attorney fee incurred in any foreclosure action, and all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien.

Sec. 2-1210. - Notices. 
(A)  All notices required by this act shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the local government by such owner; by posting as described in this Article along with first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the local government with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing; by hand delivery by a process server, law enforcement officer or Community Compliance Specialist; or by leaving the notice at the alleged violator's usual place of residence with any person residing there who is above fifteen (15) years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice or, in the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the Manager or other person in charge. 
(B)  In addition to providing notices as set forth in Subsection (A), at the option of the City Manager or his/her designee, a Special Magistrate, or the Code Enforcement Board, notice may also be served by publication or posting as follows: 
1.  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four (4) consecutive weeks (four (4) publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the County where the Code Enforcement Board is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements. 
Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. § 50.41 and § 50.051. 
2.  Such notice may be posted at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two (2) locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be the primary municipal government office. Proof of posting shall be affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(C)  Notice of publication or posting may run concurrently with or may follow an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by certified mail. Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice in compliance with this Section, together with proof of publication or posting as required herein shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this Article have been met without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

(Ord. No. 1136, 1-14-1982)  
Sec. 2-1212. - Optional enforcement.

In the event contracts are made to extend over a period of longer than one (1) year, and which are to be met from current receipts of the City, it shall be lawful for the Council to make appropriations sufficient to answer the requirements of any such contracts for only one (1) year, and the contract shall be legal and binding upon the City notwithstanding the fact that no appropriation has been made for the ensuing years over which it is to be operative, and it shall be the duty of the Council to make appropriations from year to year as required for the purpose of such contracts. The obligations of the City under such contracts shall not be considered to be a part of the indebtedness of the City.

i.  The basic hook-up charges, basic tow charges, dolly charges, storage charges, processing fees, and ten (10) percent fuel adjustment fee provided for herein shall apply seven (7) days per week, are the maximum charges allowable by the wrecker company, and are the only permissible charges by a wrecker company, for services rendered in connection with the City of Pinellas Park Police Department rotation wrecker calls. However, nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent wrecker companies rendering such services in connection with the City of Pinellas Park Police Department rotation wrecker calls from charging less than the maximum charges. 
(2)  Towing rates of each wrecker company shall be on file with inspection and application forms, and any changes will necessitate a re-application on all affected wrecker units.

(A)  User charge system. 
1.  Sufficiency of sewer rates. The rates charged for sewer use shall be sufficient to provide necessary funds for operation, maintenance and replacement of components of the sewer system before the ends of their useful lives. Said costs shall be reviewed annually by the City Council during the normal budget process to insure that there is adequate revenue to meet such costs, including, without limitation, the repayment of applicable bonded indebtedness, and that such costs are distributed among all users of the system as authorized by law. 
2.  Notice. The City shall provide notice to all users of the system, on an annual basis through the normal budget process, of the rates being charged for sewer use. 
3.  Increased costs. Any user who discharges toxic pollutants or any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the wastewater collection and transmission system shall pay for such increased costs caused thereby. Nothing herein shall be construed to excuse any user from complying with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements relating to discharge into the City of Pinellas Park sewer system. 
4.  Reports. All users contributing more than fifty thousand (50,000) gallons per month into the City of Pinellas Park sewer system and whose waste strength is greater than three hundred (300) milligrams per liter of biochemical oxygen demand or three hundred (300) milligrams per liter of suspended solids shall prepare and file with the City a report that will include pertinent data relating to the wastewater characteristics, including the methods of sampling and measurement to obtain these data, and these data may be used to calculate the user charge for that user. The City shall have the right to gain access to the waste stream to take its own samples. 
5.  Compliance with applicable Pinellas County regulations. All users of the Pinellas Park Sewer System shall comply with the provisions of the Pinellas County Sewer Use Ordinance, Ordinance No. 91-26, together with amendments and revisions thereto, to the extent available. 
6.  Compliance with applicable City of St. Petersburg regulations. All users of the Pinellas Park Sewer System in the Gateway Centre Development, which is discharged to St. Petersburg for treatment, shall comply with the provisions of the St. Petersburg Pretreatment Ordinance, St. Petersburg City code Chapter 27, Article V, Division 3, Wastewater Collection and Treatment 27-20627-217 together with amendments and revisions thereto, to the extent applicable. 
(B)  Sewer rates; sewer connection charges. In order to comply with the foregoing requirements, sewer rates and sewer connection charges shall be established by resolution. 
1.  Sewer rates, water furnished by other sources. Owners of property connected to the City's sewer system who procure water from other sources, before discharging such water into the City sewer system, shall at their expense install a meter on the premises for measuring such water usage, and shall pay the required sewer service charges established by resolution, as applicable based upon such water usage, as well as for water provided by the City of Pinellas Park. 
2.  Industrial use of sewers, pretreatment required. Industrial users of the sewer system may be required by the City to pretreat sewage before discharging same into the sewer system, if it appears that the nature or composition of such sewage waste is detrimental to or will hamper the operation of the sewer system or treatment plant. 
3.  Sewer connection charges. Sewer connection charges shall be established by resolution. 
4.  Sufficiency of sewer and water rates for reclaimed water debt service. In addition to the provisions of Subsection A(1) above, the rates charged for sewer and water use shall also be sufficient to provide necessary funds for repayment of any debt that is not paid from the charges described in Subsection (C) below for construction and related costs for the proposed reclaimed water system. Such costs will be distributed among all users of the system as authorized by law. 
5.  Billing, collection and disbursement of sewer service revenues for other governmental entities. The City is hereby authorized to enter into City Council approved interlocal agreements with other governmental entities whereby the City bills, collects, and disburses sewer service charges for sewer services provided by such other governmental entities to customer accounts to which the city provides water service. The applicable provisions of this Chapter 10 shall apply thereto to the extend provided in such interlocal agreements. 
(C)  Reclaimed water rates; reclaimed water connection charges. The rates charged for reclaimed water use shall be sufficient to provide necessary funds for operation, maintenance and replacement of the reclaimed water system and its components.

Sec. 10-121. - Deposit required; monthly payment for services; delinquency charges; turn-off; restoration of service; turn-ons. 
(A)  Residential accounts: 
1.  Upon written application for commencement of water, reclaimed water, sewer, garbage or refuse service, a deposit shall be made with the Finance Department. Interest shall accrue upon such deposit at the rate of three (3) percent per annum. The required deposit shall be made in accordance with the level of service provided and shall be established by resolution. 
(a)  A customer who has had a service history of a minimum of two (2) consecutive years, and who has had a satisfactory payment history within the most current two-year period, shall not be required to pay an additional deposit. Subsection (a)1.(a) shall apply to only one (1) account per customer. A satisfactory payment history shall be defined as a payment history that consists of fewer than three (3) penalties, no returned checks, and no delinquencies. 
(b)  When such money has remained on deposit for minimum period of one (1) full year, interest thereon at the rate of one hundred eleven thousandth percent (0.111%) per annum shall be returned to the depositor in the form of a credit against the existing account indebtedness. 
(c)  When such money has remained on deposit for a minimum period of two (2) years, and the customer has maintained a satisfactory payment history as described in Subsection (A)1.(a) above during the most recent two-year period thereof, the full amount of the deposit monies shall be returned. 
(d)  All monies so deposited shall be returned to the depositor when all services provided for herein have been permanently discontinued and further services are not required. Accrued interest thereon at the rate of one hundred eleven thousandth (0.111) percent per annum shall be returned to the depositor together with the monies on deposit in the form of a credit against the existing account. Thereupon all monies remaining after the account has been issued a final billing including, but not limited to penalties and delinquencies, required hereby, shall be returned to the depositor. 
2.  Bills for the services of utilities or any other authorized billings shall be prepared and forwarded to customers monthly. Such bills shall set forth thereon the separate charge for water service, the separate charge for sewer service, separate charge for garbage and refuse service and separate charge for reclaimed water service and each additional authorized service, the charge for delinquency, restoration of service as hereinafter described and the total thereof. However, upon an applicant's written request the City may bill the occupant of each dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling facility organized under the Condominium Act of the State of Florida when it appears economically feasible to bill on the individual basis, for utility charges, provided further that the following conditions are met by the applicant: 
(a)  That a master meter or meters exist at each supply source to the multiple-dwelling facility. 
(b)  That a written contract prepared by the City be supplied by the applicant complete with a certification that it has been negotiated by all legal owners of the property involved or complete with certification that it has been negotiated by all legal representatives as organized under the Condominium Act of the State of Florida, said contract authorizing the City to individually bill the occupant of each dwelling unit in the multiple-dwelling facility following the policies set by the City Council for this procedure. Also included as a part of this document shall be a blanket license authorizing the City's representative access to the property for the purpose of enforcing the codes and policies established by the City Council applicable to this contract. 
(c)  Upon execution of the aforementioned agreement, all current and subsequent occupants will be required to apply to the City for utility service subject to existing Council policy and pay a utility deposit as detailed in Subsection 10-121(A). Each said utility deposit will be returned to the depositor in the same manner as provided in this Chapter for the return of all other utility deposits. 
(d)  In originating the above policy procedure it shall be the applicant's responsibility to provide the City, concurrent with the execution of this policy and on forms supplied by the City, individual unit account information including the signatures of all existing occupants, to enable the City to execute the changeover to individual building as requested by the applicant. Existing original occupants at the time of execution of this procedure will be required to make a utility deposit as outlined in (c) above. 
(e)  All common facilities, which shall include any facility that is not an individual dwelling unit, shall be metered separately and said combined consumption of service shall be billed the applicant as if it were a single consumer, computed as set forth in this Chapter. Where any structure, facility or part thereof is used wholly or in part for any commercial or business purpose, each facility or part thereof so used shall be metered individually and billed the consumer as an individual account in accordance with this Chapter. 
(f)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (A)2.(b) above, the applicant may request the billing of the occupant of each dwelling unit in a multiple-dwelling facility on the "equalized basis" as outlined below. After computations of the total monthly utility consumption by the entire multiple-dwelling facility the total consumption of all common facilities as outlined in (e) above shall be deducted, after which said remaining consumption shall be equally distributed and so billed to each dwelling unit in which service was provided for any part of the previous calendar month and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. During initial phases of construction where entire units or sections of development cannot be completely isolated for the purpose of determining the exact amount of utility usage, the minimum residential water consumption will be predetermined to be four thousand (4,000) gallons per unit (reclaimed water will be predetermined to be twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per unit) for each unit in use and this usage will be billed to the occupant. Any balance in water usage above the combination of that billed the individual occupant and that billed the common facility as outlined in Subsection (A)2.(e) above shall be billed to the applicant as if it were an additional consumption of water only under the common facilities outlined in Subsection (A)2.(e) above. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to isolate units or sections of the development at the earliest possible date so that standard procedures of billing can be enacted for the area. 
(g)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (A)2.(b) above, the applicant may request the billing of the account of each dwelling unit in a multiple-dwelling facility on the "minimum basis" as outlined below. Each occupant of each dwelling unit where service was provided for any part of the previous calendar month will be billed a minimum water, reclaimed water and/or sewerage charge at the rate established by resolution and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. Any balance in utility usage as determined through the master meter after deduction of the utility usage by a combination of the total minimum individual usages and the common facilities shall be billed the applicant as if it were additional utility consumption under the common facilities outlined in Subsection (A)2.(e) above. During initial phases of construction where large quantities of water are used for construction purposes this usage may be determined by a combination of computations using the basic procedure as outlined in Subsection (A)2.(f) above to determine this water usage. This usage may then be separated from the common facility billing where utilities charges other than water would increase the utility bill if this procedure were not used. 
(h)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (A)2.(b) above the applicant may request the billing of the account of each dwelling unit in a multiple-dwelling facility on the "meter basis" as outlined below. Each occupant of each dwelling unit will receive a bill that will itemize the water, reclaimed water and/or sewerage charge where meter readings are available, at the rate provided in this Chapter and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. No meter will be recognized or read by the City unless said meter has been installed in compliance with all specifications and at locations approved by the City. All meters must be purchased through the City and no meter nor installation other than that approved by the City will be acceptable. Upon completion and approval of the installation of said meter, which shall be the responsibility of the multiple-dwelling facility applicant, said meter will become the property of the City and the City will be responsible for all future repairs and maintenance thereto. Installation of meters shall be subject to inspection by the Utility Department prior to acceptance as outlined above. During initial phases of construction water used for these purposes must be purchased from the City separately following policy procedure available for this purpose. 
(i)  A corporation-cock or other authorized utility turn-off locking device must exist for each dwelling unit and common facility account within the multiple-dwelling facility wishing to enter into a contract as outlined in Subsection (A)2.(b) above for special billing procedures. Where there are already existing units, special locking turn-off devices will not be required, but this feature will be provided for all new units built after the adoption of this procedure and for all new developments adopting this procedure at any time in the future that were constructed subsequent to September 12, 1969. 
3.  If the rates or charges for all or any part of the services provided shall not be paid within twenty (20) days after the date of any bill rendered, a delayed payment charge in the amount of ten (10) percent of the bill rendered shall be imposed and collected. 
4.  If the rates or charges for all or any part of the utility services provided by or through the City shall not be paid within thirty (30) days or as otherwise provided by Florida Statutes after the date of any bill rendered, utility service to the delinquent customer shall immediately be shut off and discontinued, unless satisfactory payment arrangements have been made. Further, said utility service shall be discontinued prior to that time if a request for such discontinuance is received from Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners, pursuant to County Ordinance due to delinquency in payment of the utility to Pinellas County. Such utility service shall not thereafter be restored until the delinquent bill, including all turn-off/turn-on charges, has been paid in full. Any part of a utility bill that is delinquent shall constitute the entire bill being delinquent. No separation of payment is permitted. 
(a)  If any residential purchaser of utility services from the City of Pinellas Park who received water service from Pinellas County, shall fail, neglect, or refuse to pay to the City of Pinellas Park, the said charges for such purchase or purchases in excess of thirty (30) days after the date of any bill rendered, the City of Pinellas Park shall have and is hereby invested with the right, power, and authority, to immediately request discontinuation of further service of water by the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners, to such purchaser until the utility bill shall be paid in full, and notice of such payment has been given to said Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners. 
5.  All applicants for reconnections resulting from turn-off services due to delinquency in the utility billing account will be deemed to be new applicants and shall be required to make the deposit as specified in Subsection 10-121(A)1, except that only one (1) deposit shall be required per customer together with a reconnection charge as established by resolution. 
6.  When it shall appear to the City Manager that certain inequities exist with regard to requirement of a deposit from a customer who has previously established satisfactory credit with respect to his water, sewer and garbage account, then the City Manager may, in his discretion, waive the deposit requirement. 
7.  With regard to accounts on an individual meter basis, upon written request by the applicant, although the account shall be in the name of the applicant, the City may bill the occupant of the subject dwelling unit solely as a convenience to the applicant. Said occupant shall be required to pay a utility deposit as described in Subsection 10-121(A). Occupant deposits shall be held in the name of the occupant and shall only be security for those utility service charges incurred while the account is being billed directly to the occupant under the provisions specified in this paragraph. Each such deposit will be returned to the occupant-depositor in the same manner as provided in this Chapter for the return of all other utility deposits. Accounts subject to billing under the provisions of this paragraph shall be cut off during any period that there is no recorded occupant for billing, and shall not be considered as active for minimum billing purposes during such periods. 
(B)  Commercial accounts: 
1.  Upon application for commencement of water, sewer, reclaimed water, garbage and refuse service, a deposit shall be made with the Finance Department. The required deposit shall be made in accordance with the level of service provided and established by resolution. 
2.  All money so deposited shall be returned to the depositor when all service provided for herein and delinquencies have been paid in full and further services are not required. When said money has remained on deposit for a minimum period of a full year, interest thereon at the rate of one hundred eleven thousandth (0.111) percent per annum shall be returned to the depositor in the form of a credit against the existing account. 
3.  Annually, each deposit shall be reviewed on the basis of actual consumption and if any significant difference is noted, appropriate reduction or increase in the amount of the deposit shall be required accordingly. 
4.  Bills for the services of water, reclaimed water, sewer, garbage and refuse and any other authorized billing shall be prepared and forwarded to customers monthly. Such bills shall set forth thereon the separate charge for garbage and refuse service and each additional authorized service, the charge for delinquency, restoration of service as hereinafter described and the total thereof. 
5.  If the rates or charges for all or any part of the services provided shall not be paid within twenty (20) days after the date of any bill rendered, a delayed payment charge in the amount of ten (10) percent of the bill rendered shall be imposed and collected. 
6.  If the rates or charges for all or any part of the services provided shall not be paid within thirty (30) days or as otherwise provided by State Statute after the date of any bill rendered, utility service to the delinquent customer shall immediately be shut off and discontinued, unless satisfactory payment arrangements have been made. Further, said utility service shall be discontinued prior to that time if a request for such discontinuance is received from Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners, pursuant to County Ordinance due to delinquency in payment of the utility to Pinellas County. Such utility service shall not thereafter be restored until the delinquent bill (together with all reconnection charges) shall be paid. Additionally, where meter services are not provided by the City, the City, at its option, may discontinue other utility services until the delinquent bill and reconnection charges have been paid. Once discontinued, utility service(s) shall not thereafter be restored until the delinquent bill (together with all reconnection charges) shall be paid. Any part of a utility bill that is delinquent shall constitute the entire bill being delinquent. No separation of payment is authorized. 
(a)  If any commercial purchaser of utility services from the City of Pinellas Park who received water service from Pinellas County, shall fail, neglect, or refuse to pay to the City of Pinellas Park, the said charges for such purchase or purchases in excess of thirty (30) days after the date of any bill rendered, the City of Pinellas Park shall have and is hereby invested with the right, power, and authority, to immediately request discontinuation of further service of water by the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners, to such purchaser until the utility bill shall be paid in full, and notice of such payment has been given to said Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners. 
7.  All applicants for reconnection resulting from turn-off services due to delinquency in the utility billing account will be deemed to be new applicants and shall be required to make a deposit together with a reconnection charge as established by resolution. 
8.  Upon the owner's written request the City may bill the occupant for each unit in a multiple-unit facility for utility charges provided the following conditions have been met by the owner: 
(a)  That a master meter or meters exist at each supply source to the multiple-unit facility. 
(b)  That a written contract, prepared by the City, be supplied by the owner complete with a certification that it has been negotiated by all legal owners of the property involved in the multiple-unit facility authorizing the City to individually bill the occupant for each dwelling unit in the multiple-unit facility following the policies set by the City Council for this procedure and specifically holding the owners of said property ultimately responsible for any individual balance due the City which is uncollectible by the City following its normal procedure of billing and deposit as established by Council policy. Also included as a part of this document shall be a blanket license authorizing the City's representatives access to the property for the purpose of enforcing the codes and policies established by the City Council applicable to this contract. 
(c)  Upon execution of the aforementioned agreement, all current and subsequent occupants will be required to apply to the City for utility service subject to the then existing Council policy and pay a utility deposit as established by resolution. Each said utility deposit will be returned to the depositor in the same manner as provided in this Chapter for the return of all other utility deposits. 
(d)  In originating the above policy procedure it shall be the owner's responsibility to provide the City, concurrent with the execution of this policy and on forms supplied by the City, individual unit account information to enable the City to execute the changeover to individual billing as requested by the owner. Existing original occupants at the time of execution of this procedure will not be required to make a utility deposit as outlined in Subsection (B)8.(c) above as said owner is ultimately responsible for each account. 
(e)  The owner of the multiple-unit facility shall be responsible and billed separately for all the utility consumption in excess of that consumption billed to the individual units within the multiple-unit facility as indicated by the master meter. In multiple-unit facilities where the "equalized basis" or the "metered basis" is being used for a billing procedure, all common facilities, which shall include any facility that is not an individual unit, shall be metered separately and said combined consumption of service shall be billed the owner as if it were a single customer, computed as set forth in this Chapter. Where any structure, facility or part thereof is used wholly or in part for any commercial or business purpose, each facility or part thereof so used shall be metered individually and billed the customer as an individual account in accordance with this Chapter. 
(f)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (B)8.(b) above, the owner may request the billing of the occupant of each unit in a multiple-unit facility on the "equalized basis" as outlined below. After computation of the total monthly utility consumption by the entire multiple-unit facility the total consumption of the all common facilities as outlined in Subsection (B)8.(a) above shall be deducted after which said remaining consumption shall be equally distributed and so billed to each unit in which service was provided for any part of the previous calendar month and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. During initial phases of construction where entire units or sections of development cannot be completely isolated for the purpose of determining the exact amount of utility usage, the minimum residential water consumption will be predetermined to be three thousand (3,000) gallons per unit (reclaimed water will be predetermined to be twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per unit) for each unit in use and this usage will be billed the owner. Any balance in water usage above the combination of that billed the individual occupant and that billed the common facility as outlined in Subsection (B)8.(e) above shall be billed to the owner as if it were an additional consumption of water only under the common facilities outlined in Subsection (B)8.(e) above. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to isolate units or sections of the development at the earliest possible date so that the standard procedures of billings can be enacted for the area. 
(g)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (B)8.(b) above, the owner may request the billing of the account of each unit in a multiple-unit facility on the "minimum basis" as outlined below. Each occupant of each unit where service was provided for any part of the previous calendar month will be billed a minimum water, reclaimed water and/or sewerage charge at the rate established by resolution and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. Any balance in utility usage as determined through the master meter after deduction of the utility usage by a combination of the total minimum individual usages and the common facilities shall be billed the owner as if it were additional utility consumption under the common facilities outlined in Subsection (B)8.(e) above. During initial phases of construction where large quantities of water are used for construction purposes, this usage may be determined by a combination of computations using the basic procedure as outlined in Subsection (B)8.(f) above to determine this water usage. This usage may then be separated from the common facility billing where utilities charges other than water would increase the utility bill if this procedure were not used. 
(h)  As will be described in the contract outlined in Subsection (B)8.(b) above, the owner may request the billing of the account of each unit in a multiple-unit facility on the "meter basis" as outlined below. Each occupant of each dwelling unit will receive a bill that will itemize the water, reclaimed water and/or sewer charge where meter readings are available, at the rate provided in this Chapter and shall include any other billings or service charges as may be applicable to each unit as established by the City Council such as utility taxes, surcharges, garbage and refuse charges, penalties, etc. No meter will be recognized or read by the City unless said meter has been installed in compliance with all specifications and at locations approved by the City. All meters must be purchased through the City and no meter nor installation other than that approved by the City will be acceptable. Upon completion and approval of the installation of said meter which shall be the responsibility of the multiple-unit facility owner, said meter will become the property of the City and the City will be responsible for all future repairs and maintenance thereto. Installation of meters shall be subject to inspection by the Utility Department prior to acceptance as outlined above. During initial phases of construction water used for construction purposes must be purchased from the City separately following policy procedures available for this purpose. 
(i)  A corporation-cock or other authorized water turn-off locking device must exist for each dwelling unit and common facility account within the multiple-unit facility wishing to enter into a contract as outlined in Subsection (B)8.(b) above for special billing procedures. Where there are already existing units, special locking turn-off devices will not be required, but this feature will be provided for all new units built after the adoption of this procedure at any time in the future that were constructed subsequent to September 12, 1969. 
(j)  When no contract is executed as described in Subsection (B)8.(b) above, the service order shall be the contract and the owner of the multiple-unit facility responsible for the master meter will be charged the approved minimum balance for each occupied unit, plus the master meter, or the cost of actual consumption, whichever is greater. 
9.  With regard to accounts on an individual meter basis, upon written request by the applicant, although the account shall be in the name of the applicant, the City may bill the occupant of the subject unit solely as a convenience to the applicant. Said occupant shall be required to pay a utility deposit in conformance with the provisions of Subsections (B)1. and (B)3. above, except where the applicant chooses to pay the deposit directly. Occupant deposits shall be held in the name of the occupant and shall only be security for those utility service charges incurred while the account is being billed directly to the occupant under the provisions specified in this paragraph. Each such deposit will be returned to the occupant-depositor in the same manner as provided in this Chapter for the return of all other utility deposits. Accounts subject to billing under the provisions of this Subsection shall be cut off during any period that there is no recorded occupant for billing, and shall not be considered as active for minimum billing purposes during such periods. 
(C)  Governmental agencies. No deposits shall be required of any governmental agency. 
(D)  Turn-on charges. In addition to all the foregoing applicable charges, turn-on charge shall be required as established by resolution.

For the purpose of this Article the following definitions shall apply: 
Building. The term "building" shall mean any structure, whether public or private, that is adapted for occupancy for transaction of business, for rendering or professional services, for amusement, for the display, sale or storage of goods, wares or merchandise, or for the performance of work or labor, including hotels, rooming houses, residences, apartments, trailer parks or mobile homes or homesites, office buildings, public buildings, churches, schools, hospitals, penal institutions, stores, theaters, houses, workshops, factories, buildings where people may assemble or congregate, and all outhouses, sheds, barns and other structures on premises used for business, residential or recreational purposes. 
Occupant. The term "occupant" shall mean the individual, partnership or corporation that has the use of or occupies any building or a part or fraction thereof, or vacant or unimproved lands, whether the actual owner or tenant. In the case of vacant buildings or lands, or any vacant portion of a building or lands or any vacant portion of a building, the agent or other person having custody of the buildings or lands shall have the same responsibilities as if he were the occupant of the building so vacated. 
Owner. The term "owner" shall mean the actual owner of any building or vacant or unimproved lands, whether individual, partnership or corporation, or the agent of the building or vacant or unimproved lands, or other person having custody of the building or land to whom rent is paid. In the case of buildings leased with a clause in the lease specifying the lessee is responsible for the maintenance and repairs, the lessee will be considered in such cases as the "owner" for the purpose thereof. 
Rat harborage. The term "rat harborage" shall mean any condition existing in, under, over or outside a structure of any kind or in or about vacant or unimproved lands, which provides shelter or protection for rats, thus favoring their multiplication. 
Rat-stoppage or rat-proofing. The term "rat-stoppage" or "rat-proofing", as used herein, applies to a relatively inexpensive form of rat-proofing to prevent the ingress or rats into buildings from the exterior or from one building to another. It consists essentially of the closing of all openings in the exterior walls, ground or first floors, basements, roofs or foundations, that may be reached by rats from the ground by climbing or burrowing, with materials impervious to rat gnawing and materials for poisoning or killing rats on vacant or unimproved lands.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 4038, § 1, adopted September 21, 2017, repealed the former chapter 14, §§ 14-101, 14-210, 14-202, 14-30114-305, 14-40114-405, 14-501, 14-502, 14-601, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former chapter 14 pertained to rights-of-way and easement utilization, and derived from Ord. No. 2460, adopted on November 13, 1997; and Ord. No. 2529, adopted November 14, 2002. 
 
ARTICLE I. - USE OF AND/OR CONSTRUCTION IN CITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
 
Sec. 14-101. - Definitions. 
In this section: 
Construction means any activity or installation performed by any entity other than the City within the boundaries of any city right-of-way, including, but not limited to, curb cuts; driveways; excavation activities; installation of pavers, poles, conduits, wires, cables, electrical conductors, fiber optics, digital technology fixtures, manholes, sewer lines, water lines, fencing, signage and sidewalks; structures or other improvements or fixtures; and landscaping activities. 
Rights-of-way means any opened or unopened city street, roadway or alleyway or any easement or any real property owned by the city. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-102. - Activities in city rights-of-way without permits. 
The following construction and/or use activities are prohibited within the boundaries of all city rights-of-way unless permitted in accord with the provisions of this article: 
(1)  Installation of mailboxes other than units prescribed by U.S. Postal Service Standards and Florida Department of Transportation Parking and Traffic Design Standards. 
(2)  Decorative walls. 
(3)  Retaining walls. 
(4)  Buildings or structures of any kind. 
(5)  Barriers or obstructions of any kind. 
(6)  Basketball goals. 
(7)  Skateboard ramps. 
(8)  Recreational structures of any kind, whether temporary or permanent. 
(9)  Fences. 
(10)  Swimming pools. 
(11)  Parking lots. 
(12)  Landscaping of any kind. 
(13)  Any other facility, object or item requiring a permanent foundation or which cannot be removed readily. 
(14)  Any facility, object or item designed and intended for personal or private use and not for public use. 
(15)  Security lights and street lights. 
(16)  Driveways, new, modified or replaced. 
(17)  Any work, construction activity or item which creates an obstruction, whether permanent or temporary, to the free and complete use of the right-of-way. 
(18)  Trenchless construction activities. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-103. - Permits and revocable licenses required. 
(1)  Any person or entity desiring to install, place, construct or replace any improvement in a city public right-of-way shall obtain prior to commencement of any work a permit for such activity issued by the city manager or his or her designee on terms and conditions as defined below and, in certain instances, the issuance of a revocable license approved by the city council. 
(2)  Any such person or entity shall first obtain the written approval of, and all other necessary permits from, all appropriate City agencies, including, but not limited to, the Building Development Division and Public Works Department. Applications for such approval shall be made in the form prescribed by the Building Development Division. 
(3)  Fees for permits and revocable licenses shall be determined by resolution of the city council. 
(4)  No use of or construction in a public right-of-way shall be permitted or licensed if that use or construction creates an obstruction, barrier or safety hazard as defined by generally accepted engineering practices. 
(5)  All requested uses of or construction in a public right-of-way shall be evaluated for the benefit of said use or construction to the general public or for whether the benefit to and convenience gained by a private property owner conflicts with the benefit to the general public for the use of the right-of-way affected. 
(6)  Revocable licenses are required for all improvements in the public right-of-way which are not accepted for maintenance by the city. Such improvements are for the benefit and pleasure of the property owner. License fees shall be adopted by resolution of the city council. 
(7)  All revocable license agreements shall include terms established by the city attorney and shall be approved by the city council upon recommendation of the city manager or his or her designee. 
(8)  The permit applicant shall be the owner or owners of the real property located adjacent to the affected right-of-way or a person designated by affidavit of said owner or owners. 
(9)  Time limitations. 
(a)  In no case shall construction commence on any improvement within any public right-of-way or easement before a permit is issued. A permit issued by the city shall be valid for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of issuance. If a period in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days is required because of the scope of work, approval shall be obtained in advance of the issuance of the permit and the permit validation period shall reflect such extension. A permit shall not be extended more than three (3) times or for more than one (1) year from the date of issuance. 
(b)  After issuance of the permit, the permittee shall notify the city public works department a minimum of two (2) business days prior to commencing construction. This notification will allow for scheduling of inspections. If a road closure is required, the permittee shall submit with the permit application a maintenance of traffic (MOT) plan to include all proposed road closures and an expected time duration for each closing. Road closures shall require separate approval by the public works department and a minimum of three (3) business days prior notification before the commencement or construction. Road closures of fewer than fifteen (15) minutes shall not require notification. 
(10)  It shall be the duty and responsibility of each applicant for a permit under this article to: 
(a)  Make a written application for permit with the public works department on such forms as the city shall prescribe. No work shall commence until the engineer has approved the application and plan and the applicant has paid and provided all fees, deposits and certificates required by this article. The engineer shall review the application and issue a decision or comments for revision and will issue permit providing all conditions of the permit application have been met and all required fees, deposits and certificates from the applicant have been received. 
(b)  Include in the application information stating the kind, character and purpose of the proposed excavation or opening and such other information which may be reasonably required to fulfill the requirements of this article. 
(c)  Furnish in triplicate a detail plan with dimensions showing the location of the work to be performed under such permit. If approved by the engineer, one copy of such plan shall be returned to the applicant at the time the permit is granted. 
(d)  Obtain a permit for each and every project. 
(e)  Agree to save the city, its officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all costs, damages and liabilities which may accrue or be claimed to accrue by reason of any work performed under such permit. The acceptance of any permit under this article shall constitute such an agreement by the applicant whether such acceptance is expressed or not. 
(f)  Pay a permit and engineering review fee and security deposit. Developers of major subdivisions may request to pledge assurances to the city in lieu of cash or check, and the city, in the sole exercise of the city's judgment and discretion, may accept or reject such assurances. 
(g)  Furnish a certificate of insurance. 
(h)  Keep the original copy of the permit and an approved copy of the plan in the possession of the party actually doing the work, and when required, exhibit such copy to the engineer, duly authorized inspectors or, in the instances of county and state roads, to the respective inspectors representing these authorities. 
(i)  Agree to perform the work, in accord with the permit conditions, the regulations established under this article and such further conditions as may be imposed by the engineer. 
(11)  Bond. A performance bond, or other financial security, in form, content and execution approved by the city attorney, may be required to protect the city in the event the specified work is incomplete and certificate of occupancy has been requested or when damages to the right-of-way or any public property have occurred and not repaired in accord with good engineering practices or when the work is nonconforming as determined by the public works department. In addition to paying the permit and inspection fees established by resolution of the city council, a performance bond or other security approved by the city attorney shall be due in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a nonrefundable processing fee plus two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) as a retainer refundable within thirty (30) days after completion of specified work. If the work in question exceeds a value of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), the bond amount shall be increased by the difference plus ten (10) percent of that difference. If said work remains incomplete after thirty (30) days, or otherwise as approved in writing by the City Manager or designee, the bond will be forfeited. Such forms shall prescribe the manner in which noncompliance with the provisions of a permit or this subchapter shall be remedied and shall provide the necessary financial assurances to remedy any noncompliance. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
ARTICLE II. - COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
 
Sec. 14-201. - Short title. 
This Article II shall be known, and may be cited, as the "Pinellas Park Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-202. - Findings, intent and scope. 
(A)  The City hereby makes and declares the following findings and declares its legislative intent as follows: 
(1)  The Public Rights-of-Way within the City of Pinellas Park are a unique and physically limited resource and important amenity that are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the City. 
(2)  The demand for telecommunications services has grown exponentially in recent years, requiring the continual upgrading of telecommunications equipment and services to satisfy such demand. 
(3)  The placement of telecommunications equipment and facilities in the public rights-of-way to satisfy the demand for telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the City's responsibility to manage its public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The Public Rights-of-Way must be managed and controlled in a manner that enhances the health, safety and general welfare of the City and its citizens. 
(5)  The use and occupancy of the Public Rights-of-Way by providers of communications services must be subject to regulation which can ensure minimal inconvenience to the public, coordinate users, maximize available space, reduce maintenance and costs to the public, and facilitate entry of an optimal number of providers of cable, telecommunications, and other services in the public interest. 
(6)  Section 166.041, Florida Statutes, provides for procedures for adoption of an ordinance which is a regulation of general and permanent nature and enforceable as local law. 
(7)  Section 337.401, Florida Statutes, addresses the authority of municipalities to regulate the placement and maintenance of communication facilities, and other utilities, in the public rights-of-way. 
(8)  In 2017, Florida passed Chapter 2017-136, Laws of Florida, which inter alia, amends § 337.401, Florida Statutes, to create the new Subsection (7) knowns as the Advanced Wireless Infrastructure Deployment Act ("Wireless Deployment Act"), effective July 1, 2017, to address municipalities' regulation of access to the public rights-of-way for wireless communications facilities and wireless support structures. 
(9)  The Wireless Deployment Act provides that municipalities may require a registration process in accordance with § 337.401(3), Florida Statutes, may adopt by ordinance provisions for insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties and further provides that, for any applications filed before the effective date of ordinances implementing this subsection, an authority may apply current ordinances relating to the placement of communications facilities in the right-of-way related to registration, permitting, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties. 
(10)  The communication industry is in a constant state of emerging technology that includes the infrastructure required to support the increased demand and capacity to receive and to transmit increased data and voice communications. 
(11)  A new network of wireless communications infrastructure has emerged comprised of a series of small individual antenna ("Small Cells"), or nodes ("Distributed Antenna Systems" or "DAS"), and wireless backhaul networks that are linked to a larger hub site. 
(12)  The City has received requests to place wireless communications facilities and wireless support structures within the public rights-of-way. 
(13)  The current City Code does not contain requirements for registration, insurance, permitting, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties that address sufficiently the placement or maintenance within the public rights-of-way for wireline and wireless communications facilities or wireless support structures. 
(14)  The City finds that, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, it is necessary to (i) provide for the placement or maintenance of Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way within the City limits, (ii) adopt and administer reasonable rules, regulations and general conditions not inconsistent with applicable state and federal law, (iii) manage the placement and maintenance of Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way by all Communications Services Providers, (iv) minimize disruption to the Public Rights-of-Way, and (v) require the restoration of the Public Rights-of-Way to original condition. 
(15)  It is the intent of the City to require that the placement or maintenance of any wireline or wireless communications facility or wireless support structure in the public rights-of-way must have an effective registration which satisfies the requirements set forth herein for such registration, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 
(16)  It is also the City's intent to exercise the City's retained authority to regulate and manage the City's roads and rights-of-way in exercising its police power over Communications Services Providers' placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner. 
(B)  This Article shall apply to any public or private entity who seeks to construct, place, install, maintain or operate a Communications System or Facilities, as such terms are defined herein, in the Public Rights-of-Way, unless otherwise exempt by operation of applicable state or federal law. This Article shall equally apply to a City owned or controlled Communications System except to the extent such Facilities are utilized on an internal, non-commercial basis by the City or any of its agencies, departments or bureaus.

The term does not include a Utility Pole owned by the City, nor does it include any other Utility Pole exempt from such term pursuant to § 337.401, Florida Statutes. A Utility Pole also qualifies as a "communications tower" under §§ 18-1502 and 18-1530.8 if a Wireless Infrastructure Provider proposes to install a new Utility Pole pursuant to § 14-208 (B)(4). 
Wireless Support Structure means a freestanding structure, such as a monopole, a guyed or self-supporting tower, or another existing or proposed structure designed to support or capable of supporting wireless facilities. The term does not include a Utility Pole. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-204. - Registration. 
Every Communications Services Provider that desires to place or maintain a Communications System or any Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, including any Pass Through Facilities, shall first Register with the City in accordance with this Section 14-204. Subject to the provisions prescribed in this Chapter, a Communications Services Provider that has properly Registered may apply for Development Permits to place or maintain a Communications System or Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. 
(A)  Every Communications Services Provider that desires to place or maintain Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, including any Pass Through Facilities, shall Register with the City manager or his designee's Office and shall submit the following information and documentation: 
(1)  the name of the applicant under which it will transact business in the City and, if different, in the State of Florida; and 
(2)  the address and telephone number of the applicant's principal place of business in the State of Florida and any branch office located in the City or, if none, the name, address and telephone number of the applicant's national headquarters and its Registered Agent in Florida; and 
(3)  the name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person and the person to contact in case of an emergency; and 
(4)  the type of Communications Services that the applicant intends to provide within the corporate limits of the City (if more than one, state all that apply), or, if none, state that the applicant is a Pass-through Provider or is intending only to place and maintain Pass Through Facilities, as the case may be; and 
(5)  for Registrations submitted on or after October 1, 2017, a copy of both the applicant's resale certificate and certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Revenue to engage in the business of providing communications services in the State of Florida; and 
(6)  a copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization, public convenience and necessity or other similar certification issued by the Florida Public Service Commission; and 
(7)  the number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide Communications Services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Department, the FCC, or other Federal authority, if any; and 
(8)  for an applicant that is a Pass-through Provider, in lieu of paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) above, the applicant shall provide a certified copy of the certificate or license issued by the Florida Department of State, or other appropriate state agency or department, authorizing the company to do business in the State of Florida; and 
(9)  evidence of the applicant's insurance coverage as required under this Article. 
(B)  The City shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the City manager or his designee or his or her designee. If it is found that the applicant complied with the requirements in subsection (a) above, the Registration shall be effective and the City shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of Registration in writing. If the City determines that the applicant is not in compliance, the City shall notify the applicant in writing of the non-effectiveness and denial of Registration and the reasons therefor. The City shall so reply to an applicant within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Registration and required information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness and denial of Registration shall not preclude an applicant from reapplying or filing subsequent applications for Registration under the provisions of this Section. 
(C)  An effective Registration does not, and shall not be construed to, convey equitable or legal title in the Public Rights-of-Way to any Communications Services Provider. Registration under this Ordinance governs only the placement or maintenance of a Communications System or Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the Public Rights-of-Way of facilities that are not part of a Communications System. Registration does not excuse a Communications Services Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on those facilities or property belonging to the City or another Person. Registration does not excuse a Communications Services Provider from complying with all other applicable City ordinances, codes or regulations, including the rules, regulations and general conditions set forth in this Article. 
(D)  A Communications Services Provider may cancel a Registration upon written notice to the City stating that it will no longer place or maintain a Communications System or any Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way and will no longer have a need to apply for Development Permits to perform construction or other work in the Public Rights-of-Way. A Communications Services Provider cannot cancel a Registration if it intends to continue placing or maintaining a Communications System or any Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. 
(E)  Registration, in and of itself, does not establish a right to place or maintain or a priority for the placement or maintenance of a Communications System or any Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way, but shall establish for the Communications Services Provider a right to apply for an Development Permit from the City. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this Article and further subject to any additional City ordinances, as well as any State or Federal laws that may be enacted. Registration does not excuse or exempt a Communications Services Provider from having to obtain on Occupational License from the City in accordance with the City Code. 
(F)  A Communications Services Provider shall renew its Registration with the City by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the Registration requirements in this Article, except that any Communications Services Provider that initially Registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew its Registration until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (1), a Communications Services Provider shall provide updated information to the City. If no information in the then-existing Registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a Registration may result in the City restricting the issuance of additional Development Permits until the Communications Services Provider has complied with the Registration requirements of this Article. 
(G)  In accordance with applicable City ordinances, codes or regulations, a Development Permit is required for a Communications Services Provider to place or maintain a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way. An effective Registration shall be a condition of obtaining such a permit. Notwithstanding an effective Registration, all permitting requirements shall apply, including the requirement to pay for any such permits unless otherwise provided by resolution or ordinance of the City. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of the Communications Services Provider having an effective Registration if all permitting requirements of the City and other provisions of this Article are met. 
(H)  A Reseller, which by definition does not place or maintain Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, is not required to Register with the City. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-205. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets. 
If a Communications Services Provider transfers, sells or assigns its System or any Facilities located in the Public Rights-of-Way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the Communications Services Provider's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the provisions set forth in this Article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by the Communications Services Provider to the City within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not currently Registered with the City, then the transferee, buyer or assignee must Register as provided in § 14-204 within sixty (60) days of the effective date of such transfer, sale or assignment. If any applications for Development Permits are pending under the Communications Services Provider's name as of the date the City receives written notice of the transfer, sale or assignment, then the City shall consider the transferee, buyer or assignee as the new applicant unless otherwise notified by the Communications Services Provider. 
(Ord. No. 4038, § 2, 9-21-2017, eff. 7-27-2017)  
Sec. 14-206. - Rules, regulations and general conditions to placement of and use of communications systems and facilities in the public right-of-way. 
As a condition of allowing the placement or maintenance of a Communications System or any Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way, and under additional authority granted pursuant to Chapter 337, Florida Statutes, the City hereby imposes the following rules, regulations and general conditions. Unless otherwise provided in this Article II, these rules, regulations and general conditions shall apply to all Communications Services Providers, including those that are Pass-through Providers irrespective of whether they place and maintain only conduit, dark fiber or Pass-Through Facilities. 
(A)  Rules on Utilization of the Public Rights-of-Way. 
(1)  Compliance with Laws. A Communications Services Provider shall at all times be in full compliance with and abide by all applicable Federal, State and local laws, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a Communications System and Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. 
(2)  Due Care. A Communications Services Provider shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the Public Rights-of-Way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(3)  Permits. A Communications Services Provider shall not commence to place or maintain a Communications Facility in Public Rights-of-Way until all applicable permits have been issued by the City and other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or general welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. The Communications Services Provider shall provide prompt notice to the City of the placement or maintenance of a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way in the event of an emergency and shall, after-the-fact, be required to submit plans and Record Drawings and As-Built Surveys, if required by the City manager or his designee, showing the placement or relocation of a Communications Facility undertaken in connection with the emergency. 
(4)  Application for Development Permit. Prior to the issuance of a Development Permit to allow the placement or maintenance of a Communications System or Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way, the City has the right to first review and consider and the Communications Services Provider shall provide all of the following: 
(a)  The expected dates and times when the Facility will be installed and the estimated time needed for construction and placement of the proposed Facility; 
(b)  The location of the proposed Facility, the Public Rights-of-Way affected and a description of the Facility, including the type of Facility (e.g. conduit, fiber, twisted pair, etc.), the number of fibers or other cable being installed, and the approximate size of the Facility (e.g. length, height, width and diameter); and, 
(c)  Plans, drawings, photographs, and schematics (including cross section layout) prepared by a qualified engineer or technician showing where the Facility is proposed to be located in the Public Rights-of-Way and showing any known Communications Facilities or utility facilities in such Public Rights-of-Way. 
(5)  Revised Plans. If the plans or drawings submitted showing the proposed location for installation of the Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way require revision for any reason prior to commencing construction, the Communications Services Provider shall promptly submit revised plans and drawings to the City manager or his designee. 
(6)  Power to Restrict Area. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by State or Federal law, the City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional Communications Facilities within a particular area of the Public Rights-of Way and deny the issuance of a Development Permit. 
(7)  Limited Purpose of Development Permit. A Development Permit issued by the City constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with this Chapter, and does not create any property right or other vested interest, or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the Public Rights-of-Way. Development Permits shall be granted only for specific routes or locations in the Public Rights-of-Way and for such term as described in the permit. The City's issuance of a Development Permit shall not be construed as a warranty that the placement of any Communications Facility is in compliance with applicable codes, regulations or laws. 
(8)  Responsibility for Contractors. Every Communications Services Provider that is Registered with the City shall be liable for the actions of contractor(s) hired by them to perform the placement or maintenance of Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way and shall be responsible for making sure that such contractor meets and complies fully with the rules, regulations and general conditions set forth in this Article. 
(B)  Regulations on the Placement or Maintenance of Communications Facilities. 
(1)  Provision and Form of Record Drawings and As-Built Surveys. Within forty-five (45) days after completion of any placement or maintenance of a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way, the Communications Services Provider shall provide the City with Record Drawings showing the final location of such Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way. Upon request by the City manager or his designee, the Communications Services Provider shall also provide the City with As-Built Surveys within forty-five (45) days after completion of any placement or maintenance of a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way. The Record Drawings and As-Built Surveys shall be provided to the City at no cost. 
(2)  Production and Filing of As-Builts. Every Communications Services Provider that is Registered with the City shall produce and keep on file at its principal place of business an accurate and complete set of As-Builts of all Facilities placed and maintained in the Public Rights-of-Way. The location and identification of Facilities and the production of As-Builts shall be at the sole expense of the Communications Services Provider. Within thirty (30) days of any written request by the City manager or his designee, the Communications Services Provider must provide to the City, at no cost, copies of complete sets of As-Builts for the indicated Public Rights-of-Way. The failure of the Communications Services Provider to produce, keep on file, or provide to the City As-Builts as required under this Chapter is sufficient grounds for the City to deny the issuance of Development Permits in the future. 
(3)  Removal of Facilities Placed Without Permit. Any Communications Facilities placed in the Public Rights-of-Way by the Communications Services Provider without first having obtained the required Development Permits shall be removed within thirty (30) days of written notice by the City to remove the same and in default of compliance with such notice, such Facilities may be removed by order of the City manager or his designee and the cost of removal shall be borne and paid by the Communications Services Provider upon demand. 
(4)  Underground. The placement or maintenance of all Communications Facilities shall be underground unless otherwise approved in writing by the City manager or his designee. Communications Facilities shall be placed between the property line and the curb line of all streets and avenues and shall not be within the roadway or the roadway recovery area unless specifically approved in writing by the City manager or his designee. All Communications Facilities shall have consistent alignment parallel with the edge of pavement, an approximate thirty-six inch (36") depth of cover for and shall have approximately two feet (2') of horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and their appurtenances. Applicants shall provide an engineer's certification that the proposed facilities will not harm existing or planned facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. The City Manager or his designee shall make the final decision on the adequacy of depth and cover based upon the avoidance of interference with existing or planned facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way. Where approved by the City manager or his designee, Facilities to be placed in the street shall be laid according to the permanent grade of the street and at a depth below the surface of the permanent grade as each is determined by the City manager or his designee. 
(5)  Above-Ground Approval. The placement or maintenance of Facilities above-ground, including new Utility Poles and aerial wires, is subject to written approval by the City manager or his designee. Attachment to any pole or other above-ground structure must be pursuant to a valid and effective pole attachment agreement or similar instrument. Location on any Utility Pole or other above-ground structure shall not be considered a vested interest of the Communications Services Provider and such Utility Poles or structures, if owned by the Communications Services Provider, shall be removed or modified by the Communications Services Provider at its own expense whenever the City or other governmental authority determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The Communications Services Provider shall, at such time as the electric utility facilities or other Communications Facilities are placed underground or are required by the City to be placed underground, concurrently place its Communications Facilities underground without cost to the City. 
(6)  New Poles or Above-Ground Structures. The placing of any new Utility Pole or other above-ground structure to support Communications Facilities is subject to the approval of the City manager and shall be done under the supervision of the City manager or his designee. No such Utility Pole or other above-ground structure shall be placed in any gutter or drainage area and must be behind the curb to avoid damage to any sidewalk. In areas of the City where either electric utility wires or other Communications Facilities are above ground and such facilities are moved, either voluntarily or at the direction of the City, to a new Utility Pole or other above-ground structure, the Communications Services Provider or Wireless Infrastructure Provider shall likewise move all its above-ground Facilities on such Utility Poles or structures to such new Utility Pole or structure within thirty (30) days (or a longer period, as agreed by Communications Services Provider or Wireless Infrastructure Provider, and the City Manager or his designee, in writing), after receipt of written notice from either the City or the owner of the new Utility Pole or structure, without cost to the City. New Utility Poles installed by Wireless Infrastructure Providers shall also be subject to and may avail themselves of the requirements and process set forth in §§ 14-208 and 18-1530.8 hereof. 
(7)  Placement and Maintenance Standards. The placement or maintenance of Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way shall be performed in accordance with standards and requirements of the following, as is applicable and as each is in force at the time of the respective placement or maintenance of a Communications System or Facility: 
(a)  the Florida Department of Transportation Utilities Accommodation Guide; 
(b)  the State of Florida Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways; 
(c)  the Trench Safety Act (Chapter 553, Florida Statutes); 
(d)  the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act (Chapter 556, Florida Statutes); 
(e)  the National Electrical Code or the ANSI National Electrical Safety Code; and 
(f)  the "Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electrical Supply and Communication Lines" established by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Standards of the United States. 
(8)  Sunshine State One-Call. Every Communications Services Provider shall utilize, and if permissible, maintain membership in the utility notification one call system administered by Sunshine State One-Call of Florida, Inc. 
(9)  Safety and Minimal Interference. All placement and maintenance of Communication Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way shall be subject to the City Code and other regulations of the City pertaining thereto, and shall be performed with the least possible interference with the use and appearance of the Public Rights-of-Way and the rights and reasonable convenience of the property owners who abut or adjoin the Public Rights-of-Way and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Florida Department of Transportation. The Communications Services Provider shall at all times employ reasonable care and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage or injury or be a nuisance to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. All placement and maintenance shall be done in such a manner as to minimize to the greatest extent any interference with the usual travel on such Public Rights-of-Way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., micro tunneling and horizontal directional drilling techniques) for the installation of Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way as well as joint trenching or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever and whenever feasible. 
(10)  Correction of Harmful Conditions. If, at any time, the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that any Communications Facility is, or has caused a condition that is, harmful to the health, safety or general welfare of any Person, then the Communications Services Provider shall, at its own expense, promptly correct or eliminate all such Facilities and conditions. In an emergency, as determined by the City manager or his designee, when the Communications Services Provider is not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate repairs to any Communications Facility that is damaged or malfunctioning, or has caused a sunken area or other condition and, in the City manager or his designee's sole discretion, is deemed a threat to public safety, then the City, when apprised of such an emergency, shall have the right to remove, make repairs to or eliminate same with the total cost being charged to and paid for by the Communications Services Provider upon demand. 
(11)  Remedy of Hazardous Conditions. If, at any time, a condition exists that the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines is an emergency that is potentially hazardous or life threatening to any person or is a threat to the health or safety of the general public, and to remedy such condition the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that a Communications Services Provider must temporarily relocate or temporarily shut off service or transmissions through a specific Facility, then the City, as an appropriate exercise of its police powers, may order the Communications Services Provider to immediately perform such temporary relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied, and to do so at its own expense and without liability to or recourse against the City. In such an emergency, when the Communications Services Provider is not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate relocation or shut off of the specific Communications Facility, then the City shall have the right to perform, or cause to be performed, such temporary relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied with the total cost being charged to and paid for by the Communications Services Provider upon demand. 
(12)  Interference with Other Facilities. A Communications Services Provider shall not, in violation of any applicable laws or regulatory standards, design, place or maintain its Communications Facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals or facilities of any municipal or county police, fire or rescue department, the facilities of any public utility, or the Communications Facilities of another Communications Service Provider, including any cable service provider. 
(13)  Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Except in cases of emergency, a Communications Services Provider, at its own expense, shall: 
(a)  Upon thirty (30) days written notice, relocate or remove, as specified in said notice, its Communications Facility in the event the City finds that the particular Facility is unreasonably interfering in some way with the convenient, safe or continuous use, or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of any Public Rights-of-Way. If the Communications Service Provider proposes to modify the Facility instead of relocation or removal, the City Manager or his designee may on a case by case basis in his or her sole discretion permit the modification so long as the modified Facility no longer interferes with the Public Rights-of-Way. The City shall provide the Communications Services Provider with a notice and order as provided for in § 337.404 of the Florida Statutes, or any subsequently enacted law of the State of Florida, in the event it charges the Communications Services Provider for the cost and expense of relocating or removing such Facility pursuant to this paragraph. 
(b)  Within a reasonable period of time from the date of written notice from the City, but not more than one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, relocate or remove, as specified in said notice, its Communications Facility in the event the City manager or his designee determines it necessary for the construction, completion, repair, relocation or maintenance of a City project, because the particular Communications Facility is interfering with or adversely affecting the proper operation of street light poles, traffic signals, or any communications system belonging to the City or an agency thereof or because the particular Communications Facility is interfering with the signals or facilities of the Pinellas Park Police Department, Pinellas Park Fire Department, or the City's municipal public utility. In the event the City issues any such written notice to the Communications Services Provider pursuant to this paragraph, and the Communications Services Provider fails to cause the aforementioned relocation or removal as required herein, the City shall be entitled to relocate or remove such Facilities without further notice to the Communications Services Provider and the total cost and expense shall be charged to the Communications Services Provider. 
(14)  Temporary Raising or Lowering of Facilities. A Communications Services Provider, upon request of any Person holding a validly issued building or moving permit from the City to temporarily encroach on or perform moving operations in or across the Public Rights-of-Way, shall temporarily raise or lower its Communications Facilities to accommodate such temporary encroachment or move. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of Facilities shall be paid by the Person requesting the same, and the Communications Services Provider shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The Communications Services Provider shall be given not less than twenty (20) days advance written notice from such Person to arrange for the temporary relocation, which notice must detail the time and location of the permitted activity, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours advance notice from the permit holder advising of the actual operation. The City is not subject to, nor shall it be liable for, any such expense or notice requirement for the moving of houses or structures performed by the City or its contractors. 
(15)  Coordination. In an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the Public Rights-of-Way and other municipal improvements, a Communications Services Provider may be required by the City manager or his designee to coordinate the placement or maintenance of its Facilities with any work, construction, installation in or repairs of the subject Public Rights-of-Way or other Facilities therein that is occurring or is scheduled to occur within a reasonable time from application for a Development Permit as determined by the City manager or his designee. Every Communications Services Providers shall make space in its trench and/or conduit within the Public Rights-of-Way available to other providers consistent with the federal requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 224. Every Communications Services Provider shall utilize existing conduits, pathways and other Facilities whenever possible, and shall not place or maintain any new, different, or additional poles, conduits, pathways or other Facilities, whether in the Public Rights-of-Way or on privately-owned property, until written approval is obtained from the City or other appropriate governmental authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner. 
(16)  Collocation and Joint Use. A Communications Services Provider, in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the useful life of the Public Rights-of-Way, shall, whenever possible, enter into joint use agreements with the City and other parties who have Registered with, or who are expressly authorized by, the City to use its Public Rights-of-Way; provided that the terms of such agreements are satisfactory to the Communications Services Provider. Nothing herein contained shall mandate that the Communications Services Provider enter into joint use agreements with parties other than the City or an agency of the City. However, prior to placement of any new or additional underground conduit in the Public Rights-of-Way, a Communications Services Provider is required to certify in writing to the City manager or his designee that it has made appropriate inquiry to all existing utilities and other entities possessing a right to occupy the Public Rights-of-Way as to the availability of existing or planned conduit that the particular Communications Services Provider could reasonably utilize to meet its needs, and that no such conduit is available or planned at a reasonable cost by any other entity on the time schedule reasonably needed. If available, a Communications Services Provider shall have the opportunity to enter into a use agreement or lease arrangement with the City or an agency of the City at or below reasonable and prevailing market rates for such conduit or fiber or, where owned by another governmental body, shall, in good faith, make reasonable effort to exhaust all means of obtaining use of such conduit or fiber before applying for an Development Permit from the City. 
(17)  Maintenance-of-Traffic. In the event that placement or maintenance of Communications Facilities conducted by the Communications Services Provider requires streets or traffic lanes to be closed or obstructed, the Communications Services Provider must, pursuant to the requirements of existing or subsequently enacted City ordinances, obtain all necessary permits from City, and shall obtain approval of its maintenance-of-traffic plan from the City manager or his designee. 
(18)  Restoration of the Public Rights-of-Way. After completion of any placement or maintenance of a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way or each phase thereof, the Communications Services Provider shall, at its own expense and in a manner reasonably acceptable to the City, restore without delay the Public Rights-of-Way so disturbed to its original condition immediately prior to the placement or maintenance work. If the Communications Services Provider fails to make such restoration within thirty (30) days following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the City may perform such restoration and charge the costs of the restoration to the Communications Services Provider in accordance with Section 337.402, Florida Statutes, as it may be amended. The Communications Services Provider shall, to the satisfaction of the City manager or his designee, maintain and correct any restorations made pursuant hereto for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of its completion. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be deemed sufficient grounds for denial of any future Development Permits for the placement or maintenance of Communications Facilities. 
(C)  General Conditions on the Utilization of the Public Rights-of-Way and the Placement or Maintenance of Communications Facilities. 
(1)  City Not Liable. Except for acts of willful misconduct or gross negligence and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither the City nor its officials, boards, councils, consultants, agents, employees or independent contractors shall have any liability to the Communications Services Provider for any claims for any damages, costs, expenses or losses resulting from the City's breakage, removal, alteration or relocation of any Facilities of any Communications Services Provider which arose out of or in connection with any emergency or disaster situation or was, in the sole discretion of the City manager or his designee, deemed necessary to facilitate any public works project, public improvement, alteration of a City structure, change in the grade or line of any Public Rights-of-Way, or the elimination, abandonment or closure of any Public Rights-of-Way or was found by City Council to be in the best interest of the health, safety or general welfare of the public; nor shall any charge be made by the Communications Services Provider against the City for any damages, costs, expenses or losses related thereto.

Any inconsistency or ambiguity between the provisions of this Chapter 14 and any lawful exercise of the City's police power shall be resolved in favor of the latter. 
(4)  City Inspection. The City shall have the right to make such inspections of a Communications System or Facilities placed or maintained in the Public Rights-of-Way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this Chapter.

It shall be in the sole discretion of the City Attorney whether an easement is compatible with or allows for its use by a Communications System or Facility. It shall be in the sole discretion of the City manager or his designee, based on the nature, design, size, configuration or proposed location of any Communications System or Facility, whether there is sufficient Capacity in a particular section of the Public Rights-of-Way or whether such System or Facility will interfere with the Facilities or equipment of any municipality, county, public utility, cable operator, or other Communications Service Provider. 
(7)  No Warranty of Fitness or Suitability. The City makes no express or implied warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the Public Rights-of-Way for any Communications System or Facility or its right to authorize the placement or maintenance of any Communications System or Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way. Any performance of work, costs incurred or services rendered by a Communications Services Provider shall be at such Provider's sole risk. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the City's authority to acquire or add Public Rights-of-Way, or to vacate or abandon Public Rights-of-Way as provided for in the City Code or applicable law. The City makes no express or implied warranties or representations regarding the availability of any acquired, added, vacated or abandoned Public Rights-of-Way for a Communications System or Facility. 
(8)  Annexations. Upon the annexation of any territory to the City of Pinellas Park, the provisions of this Article II, Chapter 14 and the rules, regulations and general conditions contained herein shall extend to the territories so annexed; and all Facilities placed, maintained, owned or operated by any Communications Services Provider extending into or already located in the Public Rights-of-Way of the territory so annexed, shall thereafter be subject to all terms hereof, as the same may be amended from time to time.

The following words and phrases as used in this Article, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, shall have the meanings hereafter set forth, and the same and similar terms when used in connection with any personnel classification System or any other Ordinance for the City of Pinellas Park shall not necessarily apply to the Members of the Retirement System hereby created except when specifically adopted: 
Accumulated contributions: Means the sum of a Member's contribution, if any, without interest received after the effective date of employment.

Annual compensation: 
(a)  Means the total compensation paid a Member during a year, exclusive of bonuses; a "year" is the calendar year. 
(b)  For all Creditable Service earned on or after October 30, 2013, the definition of annual Compensation for all members who are not then already eligible for Normal Retirement as of that date, is defined to include the following pay: pay for hours worked while rendering services to the city; sick, vacation, and personal hours used; holiday pay; lump sum payout for employees at the top of their pay grade; and incentive payments. the definition of annual Compensation shall exclude the following: pay for overtime hours which are in excess of three hundred (300) hours per calendar year, bonuses, and payouts for any accrued but unused sick or vacation hours regardless of when they were accrued, and all other compensation not specifically included. However, payouts for Pre-87 sick hours shall be included as Annual Compensation. 
(c)  Members who become eligible for Normal Retirement prior to October 30, 2013 shall have their Annual Compensation determined pursuant to subsection (a).

(b)  The average of a Member's calendar years of compensation for the five (5) calendar years (whether or not consecutive) of the last ten (10) calendar years of membership service preceding the date of determination that yields the greatest average. 
In determining the three (3) or five (5) calendar years of compensation that yield the greatest average pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), respectively, the inclusion of partial calendar years of compensation in the determination of Average Final Compensation is as follows: 
(c)  If a Member's final calendar year of membership service is not a complete calendar year, such corresponding final calendar year of compensation will be annualized by dividing the Member's final calendar year of compensation by the number of complete calendar months of membership service completed by the Member during the Member's final calendar year of membership service and multiplying this result by twelve (12). The resulting annualized, partial calendar year of compensation is then compared to the Member's next preceding four (4) or nine (9) calendar years of compensation (pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively) for purposes of identifying the calendar years of compensation that will yield the greatest three- or five-year average. The resulting annualized, partial calendar year of compensation is used only to determine if the Member's final calendar year of compensation is among the Member's greatest three (3) or five (5) years of calendar year compensation. 
(d)  If, after determining the Member's annualized, final calendar year of compensation pursuant to subsection (c), as applicable, such annualized, final calendar year of compensation is among the Member's greatest three (3) or five (5) years of calendar year compensation (pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively) the Member's third or fifth greatest calendar year of compensation (pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), respectively) is then prorated complementarily to the annualized, final calendar year of compensation by dividing such third or fifth greatest calendar year of compensation by twelve (12) and multiplying this result by the difference between twelve (12) and the number of complete calendar months of membership service completed by the Member during the Member's final calendar year of membership service. 
(e)  In annualizing the Member's partial final or prorating the Member's third or fifth calendar year of compensation pursuant to subsection (c) or (d), as applicable, a complete calendar year of membership service is considered membership service from January 1 through December 15 of any calendar year and a complete calendar month of membership service is considered membership service from the first day of any calendar month through the fifteenth day of any calendar month.

In the event a Member has performed services to the City of Pinellas Park under Articles III and/or IV as an Employee other than a general Member for purposes of determining eligibility for any Pension benefit in which length of service is a factor, including entry into the DROP, the entire period of full-time Creditable Service served as an Employee of the City of Pinellas Park shall be included, provided however, that the calculation and payment of the Pension benefits shall be pursuant to the terms of the respective Pension plans in effect at the time the Employee ceased participating in the respective Pension plan. Provided, further, for non-line of duty disability Retirement benefits in which the Member's combined years of service results in a monthly benefit of less than the minimum of twenty-five (25) percent, the Member shall be entitled to only one (1) minimum, the payment of which shall be prorated among the respective Pension plans of which the Member has Creditable Service. 
(Ord. No. 3325, 4-14-2005; Ord. No. 3726, § 5, 10-22-2010)  
Sec. 17-211. - Disability Retirement Benefit. 
(A)  Disability Retirement date: A Member who terminates employment on account of total and permanent disability, as defined in this Subsection after completing five (5) years of Creditable Service from effective date, or a Member of this System who becomes totally and permanently disabled in line of duty regardless of service, shall be entitled to a monthly disability benefit. This disability Retirement date for such Member shall be the first day of the month which coincides with or next follows the date of the final hearing which determines the Member is totally and permanently disabled. 
(B)  Total and permanent disability: A Member shall be considered totally and permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the Trustees, he or she is prevented, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, from rendering useful and efficient service as an officer or Employee. The decision of the Trustees on these questions shall be final and binding. 
(C)  Proof of disability: The Trustees, before approving payment of any disability Retirement benefit, shall require proof that the Member is totally and permanently disabled as provided herein. A Member who believes that he or she is eligible for a disability benefit shall apply therefore to the Board of Trustees on a form provided by the Board. A Member's application for disability benefits must be received by the Board of Trustees no later than one (1) year after the date of which the Member terminated employment. The Member's application must include the certification of the Member's total and permanent disability by a licensed physician of the State. No Member shall be granted disability benefits unless the Trustees receive certification of the Member's total and permanent disability by two (2) licensed physicians of the State, selected by the Trustees, and such other evidence of disability as the Trustees may require. 
(D)  Disability Retirement benefit: A Member upon Retirement on his or her disability Retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit as selected from the available options in Section 17-213 which shall be payable as of the first day of the month of his or her disability Retirement and shall be payable monthly thereafter during his or her lifetime and continued disability. The amount of each monthly payment shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal Retirement benefit, in accordance with Section 17-209, but based on the Member's Average Monthly Compensation and Creditable Service as of his or her disability Retirement date, with Creditable Service subject to the following conditions: 
1.  If the Member's disability occurred in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than forty-two (42) percent of his or her Average Monthly Compensation as of his or her disability Retirement date; or 
2.  If the Member's disability occurred other than in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of his or her Average Monthly Compensation as of his or her disability Retirement date. 
(E)  Recovery from disability: The Trustees may require periodic re-examination at the expense of the Retirement fund, and: 
1.  If the Trustees find that a Member who is receiving disability benefits is, at any time prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date, no longer disabled, the Trustees shall direct that the benefits be discontinued. The decision of the Trustees on this question shall be final and binding. 
2.  If the Member described in Subsection (E)1. (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date), does not re-enter the employ of the City and had not completed ten (10) years of Creditable Service as of his or her disability Retirement date, he or she shall be entitled to receive a return of any Excess Accumulated Contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his or her date of recovery. 
3.  If the Member described in Subsection (E)1. (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date) does not re-enter the employ of the City but had completed ten (10) or more years of Creditable Service as of his or her disability Retirement date, he or she may elect to receive either: 
(a)  Any Excess Accumulated Contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his or her date of recovery; or 
(b)  A deferred retirement benefit commencing on the first day of the month of his or her Normal Retirement Date which shall be payable on the first day of the month thereafter during his or her lifetime. 
4.  If the Member recovers from disability and re-enters employment of the City within six (6) months after his or her recovery, his or her service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability benefit payment and ending with the date he or she re-entered employment will not be considered as Creditable Service for the purpose of computing benefits. 
The amount of monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal Retirement benefit, in accordance with Section 17-209, but based on Average Monthly Compensation and Creditable Service as of the Member's disability Retirement date. 
(F)  Nonadmissible causes of disability: A Member shall not be entitled to receive any disability Retirement benefit if his disability is a result of the following: 
1.  Injury or disease sustained by the Member while willfully participating in riots, civil insurrections or other acts of violence or while committing a felony. 
2.  Injury or disease sustained by the Member after his employment has terminated. 
3.  Intentional, self-inflicted injury.

Sec. 17-212. - Termination benefits. 
(A)  A Member whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement prior to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service shall be entitled to the return of his or her Accumulated Contributions, if any, as of his or her date of termination. 
(B)  A Member whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement after the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service is a Vested Member who may elect to receive a monthly benefit which shall be payable as of the first day of the month following his or her application and eligibility for normal or early Retirement and shall be payable monthly thereafter during his or her lifetime. The amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-209 or early Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-209(F) but based on Average Monthly Compensation and Creditable Service as of his or her date of termination. Benefits deferred to a future date shall be based on the actuarial equivalency factors in effect at the time the benefits are applied for and granted. If a Member who after completing ten (10) years of Creditable Service elects to receive a deferred Retirement benefit dies prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date, the monthly benefit to which the member would have been entitled shall be paid in accordance with Section 17-214(B)1. if the Member is survived by a spouse or other Dependent, or Section 17-214(B)2. if the Member has no spouse or other Dependent. 
(C)  In lieu of the deferred monthly benefit provided in Subsection (B) the terminated Member may elect to receive a lump sum amount equal to his or her Accumulated Contributions, if any, as of his or her date of termination. 
(D)  If any Retired Member dies without having received benefit payments in an amount equal to his or her Accumulated Contributions, if any, and who is not survived by either a Survivor Payee or Joint Annuitant, there shall be payable to his or her designated Beneficiary(ies) an amount equal to the Member's Excess Accumulated Contributions. If no Beneficiary survives the Retiree, or if no Beneficiary has been designated, any such Excess Accumulated Contributions shall be payable to the Member's estate. 
(E)  A Member shall be deemed a terminated Member only at such time as he or she is no longer employed by the City. 
(F)  Any Member who is found guilty in a court of law of competent jurisdiction of committing or aiding and abetting any embezzlement or theft from the City, or bribery in connection with his employment with the City, or any offense specified in F.S. 112.3173 (2)(e), or who is otherwise subject to forfeiture under F.S. 112.3173(3), or any Member whose employment is terminated by reason of his commitment or aiding or abetting an embezzlement or theft from the City, or of bribery in connection with his employment with the City, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this Article, except the return of any Excess Accumulated Contributions, as of the date of termination, conviction, resignation, or Retirement, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 17-213. - Optional forms of Retirement benefits. 
(A)  This Section applies to the payment of Retirement benefits under Section 17-209, Section 17-210 and Section 17-211. Using a form provided by the Board of Trustees, each Member shall elect either Option A, Option B, Option C or Option D as his or her form of payment. Each Member must also designate his or her Beneficiary(ies), Survivor Payees or Joint Annuitant (if any) on the form. The form must be properly completed and returned to the Board of Trustees prior to the receipt of his first monthly Retirement payment. 
OPTION A: Shall be the Normal Form of Benefit. 
OPTION B: A decreased Retirement benefit payable to the Member during his or her lifetime and, in the event of his or her death within a period of ten (10) years after Retirement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such ten-year period to his Survivor Payee(s) or in case the Survivor Payee(s) is deceased, in accordance with Subsection (C) below. 
OPTION C: A decreased Retirement benefit which shall be payable during the joint lifetime of both the Member and his or her Joint Annuitant and which shall continue after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor in the same amount. 
OPTION D: A decreased Retirement benefit shall be payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her Joint Annuitant and which shall continue after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor in an amount of sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent of the amount which was payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her Joint Annuitant. 
(B)  The benefit payable under any option stated above shall be the Actuarial Equivalent, of the Normal Form of Benefit. 
(C)  A Member who elects Option B shall designate Survivor Payee(s) to receive the benefits payable in the event of his or her death. Should no Survivor Payee(s) be alive at the time of the death of the Member, then the estate of the Member shall be the Survivor Payee. 
(D)  A Member who elects Option C or Option D shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate his or her spouse or other Dependent to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of a Member. Such person shall be the Joint Annuitant of the Member. After Benefits have commenced under Option C or Option D, a Retired Member may change his or her designation of a Joint Annuitant only twice. The new Joint Annuitant must be either the spouse or other Dependent. If such a Retired Member desires to change his/her designation of a Joint Annuitant, the Member shall file with the Board of Trustees a notarized "change of Joint Annuitant" form and shall notify the former Joint Annuitant in writing of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of Joint Annuitant form, the Board of Trustees shall adjust the Member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the Member's current benefit. The consent of a Retired Member's first designated Joint Annuitant to any such change shall not be required. In all cases, the Retiree shall pay for costs incurred in recalculating the benefits. 
(E)  The election of an option shall be null and void if either the Member, designated Survivor Payee, or designated Joint Annuitant shall die before benefits commence. No Member may change his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check. 
(F)  Upon the death of a Retired Member, Survivor Payee or Joint Annuitant receiving monthly benefits under this Chapter, the monthly benefits shall be paid through the last day of the month of death and shall terminate, or be adjusted, if applicable, as of that date in accordance with the optional form of benefit at the time of Retirement.

(B)  If the employment of a Member is terminated by reason of his or her death other than in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service but prior to the actual commencement of benefits, it shall be assumed that the Member Retired as of his or her date of death in accordance with Section 17-209 if eligible for normal Retirement benefits or for early Retirement benefits, or Section 17-210 if eligible for benefits payable for dual normal Retirement: 
1.  The death benefit payable under this subsection shall be payable in the form of Option C in accordance with Section 17-213 and paid to the Member's spouse or other Dependent (as documented on a form provided by the Board of Trustees) for his or her lifetime, provided, however, that the value of the benefit determined under this paragraph shall not be less than the value determined under Subsection (A) of this Section. 
2.  If the Member has no spouse or other Dependent, then no death benefit is payable, and the Member's Accumulated Contributions, if any, shall be payable to the Member's designated Beneficiaries, or if there are none, to the Member's estate. 
(C)  Regardless of the Member's length of service, the surviving spouse of any Member killed in the line of duty may receive a monthly Pension equal to one-half (½) of the monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death, plus fifty (50) percent of one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of all other earnings paid during the fifty-two (52) weeks ending with the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, or one-half (½) of the Member's "Average Monthly Compensation", whichever is greater, for the rest of the surviving spouse's lifetime; or in lieu of the above, the surviving spouse may elect to receive the benefit provided in Section 17-214(B) of the Article. For purposes of calculating death benefits pursuant to this subsection, "salary" shall include that gross pay which is paid regularly every pay period; and "monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death" shall be determined by taking the "salary" as defined herein paid during the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, multiplied by twenty-six (26) and then divided by twelve (12). The surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty whose benefit terminated because of remarriage shall have the benefit reinstated as of July 1, 1994, at the amount that would have been payable had such benefit not been terminated. 
(D)  If the surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty dies, the monthly payments which would have been payable to such surviving spouse had such surviving spouse lived shall be paid for use and benefit of such Member's Dependent child or children until age eighteen (18) or as provided in Subsection (F) below. 
(E)  If a Member killed in the line of duty leaves no surviving spouse, the benefits provided by Subsection (C), normally payable to a surviving spouse, shall be paid for the use and benefit of such Member's Dependent child or children until age eighteen (18) or as provided in Subsection (F) below. If the Member killed in the line of duty leaves no surviving spouse, Dependent child or children, then the Member's Accumulated Contribution shall be payable to the Member's Beneficiaries. 
(F)  As used in Subsections 17-214(C), (D) and (E), "child" or "children" shall include any child of the Member who after attaining eighteen (18) years of age is physically or mentally incapable of self-support, provided such child was financially Dependent for no less than one-half (½) of his or her support from the deceased Member at the time of the death of such Member; and provided, however, such benefits shall cease once the child of the Member becomes capable of self-support or dies. Written proof of such incapacity and financial dependency shall be furnished to the Board of Trustees prior to payment of benefits. The Board of Trustees may require proof of continued incapacity whenever it deems necessary. 
(G)  The Board of Trustees shall require proof of the Dependent status of any individual claiming benefits under this Section.

Each Member may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the Trustees, designate a choice of one or more Dependents, named in sequence, to receive the death benefits, if any, which may be payable under Section 17-214. If no Dependent is named in the manner provided above, the Trustees shall direct the payment of such benefits to the spouse of the deceased, if living. If the Member's spouse is not alive at the Member's death, any payments to which he or she was entitled shall be paid to the Dependent children of the Member, or on their behalf if under the age of eighteen (18) years or as otherwise provided in Section 17-214.

(A)  Any Member who has Retired and is receiving Retirement compensation under this Chapter may be re-employed by the City in a position designated as part-time, seasonal or temporary for up to five hundred (500) hours during any one (1) fiscal year, and such employment shall not affect the rights of such Retired Member under this Retirement System, including, without limiting the general terms thereof, his or her right to receive his or her Retirement compensation. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any point in the fiscal year the re-employed Member reaches five hundred (500) hours in any position or positions other than as a School Crossing Guard, he or she will no longer be eligible for employment during that fiscal year except as a School Crossing Guard. Provided, however, that a Member who has Retired and is receiving Retirement compensation under this Chapter may be re-employed by the City as a School Crossing Guard for up to a maximum of one thousand one hundred (1,100) hours in any one (1) fiscal year, and such employment shall not affect the rights of such Retired Member under this Retirement System, including, without limiting the general terms thereof, his or her right to receive his or her Retirement compensation. If at any point in the fiscal year the re-employed Member reaches a total of one thousand one hundred (1,100) hours, he or she will no longer be eligible for employment as a School Crossing Guard during that fiscal year. In no event shall a Member who has Retired and who is receiving Retirement compensation under this Chapter be re-employed by the City as a School Crossing Guard and in one (1) or more other positions for more than a total of one thousand one hundred (1,100) hours in any one (1) fiscal year. 
(B)  The re-employment by the City of any Member who has Retired and is receiving compensation under this Chapter, including elected officials, referred to in Subsection (A) of this Section shall have no effect on the Average Final Compensation or years of Creditable Service of such Retired Member.

(C)  Any Member who has Retired and is receiving Retirement compensation under this Chapter who is re-employed by the City shall monthly report his or her hours in writing to the Human Resources Administrator or designee. In addition, the re-employed Member shall separately report in writing his or her hours to the Human Resources Administrator or designee when the number of hours worked in any fiscal year is one hundred (100) hours less than the applicable limit set forth in Subsection (A) of this Section.

2.  Base benefit means the total monthly benefit payable or accrued to a Retiree, including DROP participant, Survivor Payee(s) or Joint Annuitant, surviving spouse or children of a Member who dies in the line of duty, in accordance with existing laws as of November 13, 1971; or date of Retirement, or entry into DROP, or earlier death, if later than November 13, 1971.

(C)  On January 1, 1973, the Trustees shall adjust the benefit of all Retirees who, as of November 13, 1971, had attained age sixty-five (65) or who had Retired on account of disability and the benefit of all Survivor Payee(s) or Joint Annuitant of deceased Members who would have attained age sixty-five (65) as of November 13, 1971. The amount of benefit payable to such person for the six-month period commencing January 1, 1973, shall be the greater of Subsections (1) and (2) where:

The Board of Trustees shall not be required to advise Members of the federal tax consequences of an election related to the DROP but may advise Members to seek independent advice. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section to the contrary, any provision of this Section shall be construed and administered in such manner that such program will qualify as a qualified governmental Pension plan under existing or hereafter enacted provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States, and City Council may adopt any rule necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Section as is necessary to retain tax qualification.

(Ord. No. 2666, 12-9-1999; Ord. No. 3344, 6-23-2005; Ord. No. 3699, § 5, 9-24-2009)

A Member who terminates employment on account of total and permanent disability, as defined in this Subsection after completing five (5) years of creditable service from effective date, or a Member of this system who becomes totally and permanently disabled in line of duty regardless of service, shall be entitled to a monthly disability benefit. This disability retirement date for such Member shall be the first day of the first month after the Board of Trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. 
(B)  Total and permanent disability. A Member shall be considered totally and permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the Trustees, he or she is prevented, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, from rendering useful and efficient service as a Firefighter and will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, he or she is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than specified in F.S. § 175.191(3). The decision of the Trustees on these questions shall be final and binding. 
(C)  Proof of disability. The Trustees, before approving payment of any disability retirement benefit, shall require proof that the Member is totally and permanently disabled as provided herein. A Member who believes that he or she is eligible for a disability benefit shall apply therefore to the Board of Trustees on a form provide by the Board. A Member's application for disability benefits must be received by the Board of Trustees no later than one (1) year after the date on which the Member terminated employment. The Member's application must include the certification of the Member's total and permanent disability by one (1) of two (2) duly qualified physicians or surgeons, selected by the Trustees, and such other evidence of disability as the Trustees may require. 
(D)  Disability retirement benefit. A Member upon retirement on his or her disability retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit as selected from available options in 17-313 which shall be payable on the first day of the month following his or her disability retirement and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during his or her lifetime and continued disability. The amount of each monthly payment shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, in accordance with Section 17-309, but based on the Member's average monthly compensation and creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, with creditable service subject to the following conditions: 
1.  If the Member's disability occurred in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than forty-two (42) percent of his average monthly compensation as of his or her disability retirement date; or 
2.  If the Member's disability occurred other than in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of his average monthly compensation as of his or her disability retirement date. 
(E)  Recovery from disability. The Trustees may require periodic re-examination at the expense of the Retirement Fund; and 
1.  If the Trustees find that a Member who is receiving disability benefits is, at any time prior to his or her normal retirement date, no longer disabled, the Trustees shall direct that the benefits be discontinued. The decision of the Trustees on this question shall be final and binding. 
2.  If the Member described in Subsection (E)(1) (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her normal retirement date), does not re-enter the employ of the City and had not completed ten (10) years of creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, he or she shall be entitled to the excess, if any, of his or her accumulated contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his date of recovery. 
3.  If the Member described in subparagraph (E)(1) (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her normal retirement date) does not re-enter the employ of the City but had completed ten (10) or more years of creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, he or she may elect to receive: 
(a)  The excess, if any, of his or her accumulated contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his date of recovery. 
(b)  A deferred benefit commencing on the first day of the month of his or her normal retirement date which shall be payable on the first day of the month thereafter during his or her lifetime. 
The amount of monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, in accordance with Section 17-309 but based on average monthly compensation and creditable service as of the Member's disability retirement date. 
4.  If the Member recovers from disability and re-enters employment of the City after his or her recovery, his or her service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability benefit payment and ending with the date he or she re-entered employment will not be considered as creditable service for the purpose of computing benefits. The term "accumulated contributions" for such Members wherever used in the Section after recovery shall mean the excess of a Member's accumulated contributions as of his or her disability retirement date over total disability benefits received under subsection (E)(3) of this Section. 
(F)  Nonadmissible causes of disability. A Member shall not be entitled to receive any disability retirement benefit if his or her disability is a result any cause listed in F.S. § 175.191(3).

The amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a Normal Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-309 or Early Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-309(I) but based on Average Monthly Compensation and Creditable Service as of his or her date of termination. Benefits deferred to a future date shall be based on the actuarial equivalency factors in effect at the time the benefits are applied for and granted. 
(C)  In lieu of the deferred monthly benefit provided in subsection (B) the terminated Member may elect to receive a lump sum amount equal to his or her Accumulated Contributions, if any, as of his or her date of termination. 
(D)  If any Retired Member who has selected Option A dies without having received in benefit payments in an amount equal to his or her Accumulated Contributions, if any, there shall be payable to his or her designated Beneficiary an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Member's Accumulated Contributions over the total monthly payments made to the Member prior to his or her date of death.

On a form provided by the plan, the designated Beneficiary shall elect either Option B or Option C in accordance with Section 17-313. If a Member dies leaving no designated Beneficiary, the benefits due the Member shall be payable to the Member's estate.

Sec. 17-313. - Optional forms of Retirement benefits. 
(A)  This Section applies to the payment of Retirement benefits under Section 17-309, Section 17-310 and Section 17-311. On an approved form, each Member shall elect either Option A, Option B, Option C or Option D as his or her form of payment. Each Member must also designate his or her Beneficiary or joint annuitant(if any) on this form. The form must be properly completed and returned to the Board of Trustees prior to the receipt of his or her first monthly Retirement payment. 
OPTION A: Retirement benefits payable to the Member during his or her lifetime. 
OPTION B: Effective June 30, 2005, Option B shall be the Normal Form of Benefit and shall be a ten (10) year certain and life Annuity payable to the Member during his or her lifetime and, in the event of his or her death within a period of ten (10) years after Retirement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such ten (10) year period to his or her Beneficiary(ies). 
OPTION C: A Retirement benefit which shall be payable during the joint lifetime of both the Member and his or her joint annuitant and which shall continue at one hundred (100) percent after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor. 
OPTION D: A Retirement benefit shall be payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her joint annuitant and which shall continue after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor in an amount of either: (1) seventy-five (75) percent; or (2) sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent; or (3) fifty (50) percent of the amount which was payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her joint annuitant. 
(B)  The benefit payable under any option stated above shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Normal Form of Benefit. 
(C)  A Member who elects Option A or B, shall designate a Beneficiary(ies) on a form provided by the Board of Trustees to receive the benefits payable, if any, in the event of his or her death.

Such person shall be the joint annuitant of the Member.

There shall be no requirement that the joint annuitant being replaced agree to the change, be in good health, or even be alive. If such a Retired Member desires to change his or her designation of a joint annuitant, the Member shall file with the Board of Trustees a notarized "change of joint annuitant," form. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form, the Board of Trustees shall adjust the Member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the Member's current benefit. In all cases, the retiree shall pay for costs incurred in recalculating the benefit. 
(E)  The election of an option shall be null and void if either the Member, designated Beneficiary, or designated joint annuitant shall die before benefits commence. No Member may change his or her Retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first Retirement check. 
(F)  The Board of Trustees shall adopt appropriate tables and calculations necessary to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit to which the Member is otherwise entitled under Option B.

(H)  This Section shall be administered pursuant to F.S. § 175.171(2).

(A)  If the employment of a Member is terminated by reason of his or her death other than in the line of duty prior to the completion of ten (10) years of creditable service, there shall be payable to his or her designated Beneficiary the Member's accumulated contributions, without interest. If no Beneficiary is designated or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the accumulated contributions shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(B)  If the employment of a Member is terminated by reason of his or her death other than in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of creditable service but prior to the actual commencement of benefits, it shall be assumed that the Member retired as of his or her date of death in accordance with Section 17-309 if eligible for normal retirement benefits or for early Retirement benefits, or Section 17-310 if eligible for benefits payable for dual normal Retirement, having elected Option B in accordance with Section 17-313(A). Alternately, upon providing a written election, the designated Beneficiary may choose to receive benefits payable under Option C for his or her lifetime. If no Beneficiary is named or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the benefits due the Member shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(C)  Regardless of the Member's length of service, the surviving spouse, who is also the designated Beneficiary, of any Member who dies in the line of duty may receive a monthly pension equal to one-half (½) of the monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death, plus fifty (50) percent of one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of all other earnings paid during the fifty-two (52) weeks ending with the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, or one-half (½) of the Member's "average monthly compensation," whichever is greater, for the rest of the surviving spouse's lifetime; or in lieu of the above, the surviving spouse may elect to receive the benefit provided in Section 17-314(B) of this Article. For purposes of calculating death benefits pursuant to this subsection, "salary" shall include that gross pay which is paid regularly every pay period; and "monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death" shall be determined by taking the "salary" as defined herein paid during the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, multiplied by twenty-six (26) and then divided by twelve (12). The surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty whose benefit terminated because of remarriage shall have the benefit reinstated as of July 1, 1994, at the amount that would have been payable had such benefit not been terminated. 
(D)  If the surviving spouse receiving benefits under paragraph (C) above dies, the monthly payments which would have been payable to such surviving spouse had such surviving spouse lived shall be paid for use and benefit of such Member's child or children until age eighteen (18) or as provided in subsection (F) below. However, the minimum benefit payable by the fund under this paragraph, to all Beneficiaries combined, shall be actuarially equivalent to the Option B benefit. 
(E)  If a Member who dies in the line of duty leaves no surviving spouse, and the children are named as the designated Beneficiary, the benefits provided by subsection (C), normally payable to a surviving spouse, shall be paid for the use and benefit of such Member's child or children until age eighteen (18) or as provided in subsection (F) below. However, the minimum benefit payable by the fund under this paragraph, to all Beneficiaries combined, shall be actuarially equivalent to the Option B benefit. 
(F)  As used in subsections 17-314(D), (E) and (G), "child" or "children" shall include any child of the Member who after attaining eighteen (18) years of age is physically or mentally incapable of self-support, provided such child was financially dependent for no less than one-half (½) of his/her support from the deceased Member at the time of the death of such Member; and provided, however, such benefits shall cease once the child of the Member becomes capable of self-support or dies. Written proof of such incapacity and financial dependency shall be furnished to the Board of Trustees prior to payment of benefits. The Board of Trustees may require proof of continued incapacity whenever it deems necessary. 
(G)  If a Member dies in the line of duty prior to completing ten (10) years of service and does not designate the spouse or "child" or "children" as defined in subsection (F) as the beneficiary, then the Member's accumulated contribution without interest shall be payable to the Member's designated Beneficiary. If no Beneficiary is designated or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the accumulated contributions shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(H)  If a Member dies in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service and leaves no designated Beneficiary or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the Option B benefits due the member shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(I)  If a Member dies in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service and is survived by designated Beneficiary who is not the surviving spouse, the Option B benefits due the member shall be payable to the Member's beneficiary.

Within ninety (90) days after the end of a calendar quarter following the separation of a Member as a Firefighter, the balance in the Member's DROP account payable at the option of the terminated DROP participant, or if deceased, such participant's designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, shall be distributed, to the extent allowed by law, by rollover to another qualified plan, as a lump sum payment, or as a combination of both, as provided by rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees, provided that such distribution may be adjusted by City Council to maintain Internal Revenue Code qualification of the Pinellas Park Firefighters' Pension Fund. 
2.  If a DROP participant dies during the DROP calculation period, or on or before the DROP participants' full DROP accumulation is distributed, any remaining DROP accumulation shall be distributed to the DROP participant's designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, or, if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, to the participant's spouse, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary and no surviving spouse, to the participant's estate.

(F)  The Pension benefits of a DROP participant as calculated in accordance with Sections 17-309, 17-313 and 17-318 are to be maintained in the Pinellas Park Firefighters' Pension Fund for investment. The DROP account will be an account in a bookkeeping sense only until separation from employment as a Firefighter and payout of the account. 
(G)  Administration of program. The Board of Trustees shall make such rules as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this Section, provided that such rules are not inconsistent with the terms of any collective bargaining agreement entered into by the City and the certified bargaining agents for Firefighters concerning the DROP. The Board of Trustees shall not be required to advise Members of the Federal tax consequences of an election related to the DROP, but may advise Members to seek independent advice. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section to the contrary, any provision of this Section shall be construed and administered in such manner that such program will qualify as a qualified governmental Pension plan under existing or hereafter enacted provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States, and City Council may adopt any rule necessary to accomplish the purpose of this Section as is necessary to retain tax qualification.

The share account balances of such non-vested terminated Members shall be redistributed into the allocation for the next fiscal year. 
(H)  Death or disability. The designated Beneficiary of a Member who dies shall receive the accumulated total of the Member's share account. A Member awarded a disability Pension from the Pinellas Park Firefighters' Pension Fund shall receive the accumulated total of his or her share account.

(Ord. No. 2667, 12-9-1999; Ord. No. 3671, § 4, 2-27-2009)  
Sec. 17-411. - Disability retirement benefit. 
(A)  Disability retirement date. A Member who terminates employment on account of total and permanent disability, as defined in this subsection after completing five (5) years of creditable service from effective date, or a Member of this system who becomes totally and permanently disabled in line of duty regardless of service, shall be entitled to a monthly disability benefit. This disability retirement date for such Member shall be the first day of the first month after the Board of Trustees determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determines such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. 
(B)  Total and permanent disability. A Member shall be considered totally and permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the Trustees, he or she is prevented, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, from rendering useful and efficient service as a Police Officer and will be considered permanently disabled if, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, he or she is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other than specified in F.S. § 185.18(3). The decision of the Trustees on these questions shall be final and binding. 
(C)  Proof of disability. The Trustees, before approving payment of any disability retirement benefit, shall require proof that the Member is totally and permanently disabled as provided herein. A Member who believes that he or she is eligible for a disability benefit shall apply therefore to the Board of Trustees on a form provided by the Board. A Member's application for disability benefits must be received by the Board of Trustees no later than one (1) year after the date on which the Member terminated employment. The Member's application must include the certification of the Member's total and permanent disability by one (1) of two (2) duly qualified physicians or surgeons, selected by the Trustees, and such other evidence of disability as the Trustees may require. 
(D)  Disability retirement benefit. A Member upon retirement on his or her disability retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit as selected from available options in Section 17-413 which shall be payable on the first day of the month following his or her disability retirement and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during his or her lifetime and continued disability. The amount of each monthly payment shall be computed in the same manner as for a Normal Retirement Benefit, in accordance with Section 17-409, but based on the Member's average monthly compensation and creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, with creditable service subject to the following conditions: 
1.  If the Member's disability occurred in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than forty-two (42) percent of his or her average monthly compensation as of his or her disability retirement date; or 
2.  If the Member's disability occurred other than in the line of duty, his or her monthly benefit shall not be less than twenty-five (25) percent of his or her average monthly compensation as of his or her disability retirement date. 
(E)  Recovery from disability. The Trustees may require periodic re-examination at the expense of the retirement fund; and 
1.  If the Trustees find that a Member who is receiving disability benefits is, at any time prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date, no longer disabled, the Trustees shall direct that the benefits be discontinued. The decision of the Trustees on this question shall be final and binding. 
2.  If the Member described in subsection (E)(1) (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date), does not re-enter the employ of the City and had not completed ten (10) years of creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, he or she shall be entitled to the excess, if any, of his or her accumulated contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his or her date of recovery. 
3.  If the Member described in subsection (E)(1) (who recovers from such disability prior to his or her Normal Retirement Date) does not re-enter the employ of the City but had completed ten (10) or more years of creditable service as of his or her disability retirement date, he or she may elect to receive: 
(a)  The excess, if any, of his or her accumulated contributions over the total disability benefits received up to his or her date of recovery. 
(b)  A deferred benefit commencing on the first day of the month of his or her normal retirement date which shall be payable on the first day of the month thereafter during his or her lifetime. 
The amount of monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, in accordance with Section 17-409 but based on average monthly compensation and creditable service as of the Member's disability retirement date. 
4.  If the Member recovers from disability and re-enters employment of the City after his or her recovery, his or her service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he or she received a disability benefit payment and ending with the date he or she re-entered employment will not be considered as creditable service for the purpose of computing benefits. The term "accumulated contributions" for such Members wherever used in the Section after recovery shall mean the excess of a member's accumulated contributions as of his or her disability retirement date over total disability benefits received under subsection (E)(3) of this Section. 
(F)  Nonadmissible causes of disability. A Member shall not be entitled to receive any disability retirement benefit if his or her disability is a result of any cause listed in F.S. 185.18(3). 
(G)  Diseases of Police Officers in line of duty; presumption. The provisions of F.S. § 185.34, are incorporated herein by reference.

Sec. 17-412. - Termination benefits. 
(A)  A Member whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement prior to the completion of ten (10) years of creditable service shall be entitled to the return of his or her accumulated contributions, if any, as of his or her date of termination. 
(B)  A Member whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement after the completion of ten (10) years of creditable service is a vested employee who may elect to receive a deferred monthly benefit which shall be payable on the first day of the month following his or her application and eligibility for normal or early Retirement and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during his or her lifetime. The amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-409 or early Retirement benefit in accordance with Section 17-409(G) but based on average monthly compensation and creditable service as of his or her date of termination. Benefits deferred to a future date shall be based on the actuarial equivalency factors in effect at the time the benefits are applied for and granted. 
(C)  In lieu of the deferred monthly benefit provided in subsection (B) the terminated Member may elect to receive a lump sum amount equal to his or her accumulated contributions, if any, as of his or her date of termination. 
(D)  If any Retired Member who has selected Option A dies without having received in benefit payments in an amount equal to his or her accumulated contributions, if any, there shall be payable to his or her designated Beneficiary an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Member's accumulated contributions over the total monthly payments made to the Member prior to his or her date of death. If the Member's Beneficiary predeceases him or her or if no beneficiary has been designated, the excess accumulated contribution, shall be payable to the Member's estate. 
(E)  A Member shall be deemed a terminated Member only at such time as he or she is no longer employed by the City. If a vested and terminated Member dies prior to receiving retirement benefits, the designated Beneficiary shall be entitled to the benefits otherwise payable to the Member at early or normal retirement age. On a form provided by the plan, the designated Beneficiary shall elect either Option B or Option C in accordance with Section 17-413. If Member dies leaving no designated Beneficiary, the benefits due the member shall be payable to the Member's estate. 
(F)  Any Member who is found guilty in a court of law of committing an offense specified in F.S. 112.3173 (2)(e), or who is otherwise subject to forfeiture under F.S. 112.3173(3), shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this Article except the return of his or her accumulated contributions, if any, as of the date of termination, conviction, resignation, or Retirement, whichever occurs first. 
(G)  Pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 185.185, upon conviction of a violation described therein, a Member or Beneficiary may, in the discretion of the Board of Trustees, be required to forfeit the right to receive any or all benefits to which the person would otherwise be entitled herein. 
(Ord. No. 2633, 9-9-1999; Ord. No. 2667, 12-9-1999; Ord. No. 3345, 6-23-2005; Ord. No. 3671, § 6, 2-27-2009; Ord. No. 3711, § 4, 12-10-2009)  
Sec. 17-413. - Optional forms of retirement benefits. 
(A)  This Section applies to the payment of Retirement benefits under Section 17-409, Section 17-410, and Section 17-411. On an approved form, each Member shall elect either Option A, Option B, Option C or Option D as his or her form of payment. Each Member must also designate his or her Beneficiary or joint annuitant (if any) on this form. The form must be properly completed and returned to the Board of Trustees, prior to the receipt of his or her first monthly Retirement payment. 
OPTION A: Retirement benefits payable to the Member during his or her lifetime. 
OPTION B: Effective December 5, 2007, Option B shall be the Normal form of retirement benefit and shall be a ten (10) year certain and life annuity payable to the member during his or her lifetime and, in the event of his or her death within a period of ten (10) years after retirement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such ten (10) year period to his or her beneficiary(ies). Actuarial equivalent optional forms of benefit are available pursuant to this section. 
OPTION C: A Retirement benefit which shall be payable during the joint lifetime of both the Member and his or her joint annuitant and which shall continue at one hundred (100) percent after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor. 
OPTION D: A Retirement benefit shall be payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her joint annuitant and which shall continue after the death of either during the lifetime of the survivor in an amount of either (1) seventy-five (75) percent; or (2) sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent; or (3) fifty (50) percent of the amount which was payable during the joint lifetime of the Member and his or her joint annuitant. 
(B)  The benefit payable under any option stated above shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Normal Form of Benefit. (Ord. 2633 - 09.09.99; Ord. 3345 - 06.23.05) 
(C)  A Member who elects Option A or B, shall designate a Beneficiary(ies) on a form provided by the Board of Trustees to receive the benefits payable, if any, in the event of his or her death. Such person shall be the Beneficiary(ies) of the member. If the Beneficiary(ies) is not alive or is not in existence at the time of the death of the Member, then the estate of the Member shall be the Beneficiary. 
(D)  A Member who elects Option C or Option D shall, on a form provided by the Board of Trustees for that purpose, designate his or her joint annuitant to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the Member. Such person shall be the joint annuitant of the Member. After benefits have commenced under Option C or Option D, a Retired Member may change his or her designation of a joint annuitant twice without the approval of the Board of Trustees. There shall be no requirement that the joint annuitant being replaced agree to the change, be in good health, or even be alive. If such a Retired Member desires to change his or her designation of a joint annuitant, the Member shall file with the Board of Trustees a notarized "change of joint annuitant" form. Upon receipt of a completed change of joint annuitant form, the Board of Trustees shall adjust the Member's monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the Member's current benefit. In all cases, the Retiree shall pay for costs incurred in recalculating the benefits. 
(E)  The election of an option shall be null and void if either the Member, designated Beneficiary, or designated joint annuitant shall die before benefits commence. No Member may change his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check. 
(F)  The Board of Trustees shall adopt appropriate actuarial tables and calculations necessary to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the Member is otherwise entitled under Option B. 
(G)  Upon the death of a Retired Member or Beneficiary or joint annuitant receiving monthly benefits under this Chapter, the monthly benefits shall be paid through the last day of the month of death and shall terminate, or be adjusted, if applicable, as of that date in accordance with the optional form of benefit at the time of retirement. 
(H)  This Section shall be administered pursuant to F.S. 185.161(2).

(A)  If the employment of a Member is terminated by reason of his or her death other than in the line of duty prior to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service, there shall be payable to his designated Beneficiary the member's accumulated contributions without interest. If no Beneficiary is designated or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the accumulated contributions shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(B)  If the employment of a Member is terminated by reason of his or her death other than in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service but prior to the actual commencement of benefits, it shall be assumed that the Member retired as of his date of death in accordance with Section 17-409 if eligible for normal retirement benefits or for early Retirement benefits, or Section 17-410 if eligible for benefits payable for dual normal Retirement, having elected Option B in accordance with Section 17-413 (A). Alternately, upon providing a written election, the designated Beneficiary may choose to receive benefits payable under Option C for his or her lifetime. If no Beneficiary is named or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the benefits due the Member shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(C)  Regardless of the Member's length of service, the surviving spouse who is also the designated Beneficiary of any Member who dies in the line of duty, may receive a monthly pension equal to one-half (½) of the monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death, plus fifty (50) percent of one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of all other earnings paid during the fifty-two (52) weeks ending with the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, or one-half (½) of the Member's "average monthly compensation", whichever is greater, for the rest of the surviving spouse's lifetime; or in lieu of the above, the surviving spouse may elect to receive the benefit provided in Section 17-414(B) of this Article. For purposes of calculating death benefits pursuant to this subsection, "salary" shall include that gross pay which is paid regularly every pay period; and "monthly salary being received by the Member at the time of the Member's death" shall be determined by taking the "salary" as defined herein paid during the last full pay period immediately prior to the Member's death, multiplied by twenty-six (26) and then divided by twelve (12). The surviving spouse of a Member killed in the line of duty whose benefit terminated because of remarriage shall have the benefit reinstated as of July 1, 1994, at the amount that would have been payable had such benefit not been terminated. 
(D)  If the surviving spouse receiving benefits under paragraph (C) above dies, the monthly payments which would have been payable to such surviving spouse had such surviving spouse lived, shall be paid for use and benefit of such member's child or children until age eighteen (18) or as provided in subsection (F) below. However, the minimum benefit payable by the fund under this paragraph, to all beneficiaries combined, shall be actuarially equivalent to the Option B benefit. 
(E)  If a Member who dies in the line of duty leaves no surviving spouse, and the children are named as the designated beneficiary, the benefits provided by subsection (C), normally payable to a surviving spouse, shall be paid for the use and benefit of such Member's child or children until age eighteen (18) years or as provided in subsection (F) below. However, the minimum benefit payable by the fund under this paragraph, to all beneficiaries combined, shall be actuarially equivalent to the Option B benefit. 
(F)  As used in subsections 17-414(D), (E), and (G) "child" or "children" shall include any child of the Member who after attaining eighteen (18) years of age is physically or mentally incapable of self-support, provided such child was financially dependent for no less than one-half (½) of his/her support from the deceased Member at the time of the death of such Member; and provided, however, such benefits shall cease once the child of the Member becomes capable of self-support or dies. Written proof of such incapacity and financial dependency shall be furnished to the Board of Trustees prior to payment of benefits. The Board of Trustees may require proof of continued incapacity whenever it deems necessary. 
(G)  If a member dies in the line of duty prior to completing ten (10) years of service and does not designate the spouse or "child" or "children" as defined in subsection (F) as the beneficiary, then the Member's accumulated contribution without interest shall be payable to the Member's designated Beneficiary. If no Beneficiary is designated or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the accumulated contributions shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(H)  If a Member dies in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service and leaves no designated Beneficiary or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, the Option B benefits due the Member shall be made payable to the Member's estate. 
(I)  If a member dies in the line of duty subsequent to the completion of ten (10) years of Creditable Service and is survived by a designated Beneficiary who is not the surviving spouse, the Option B benefits due the Member shall be payable to the Member's designated Beneficiary.

Within ninety (90) days after the end of a calendar quarter following the separation of a Member as a Police Officer, the balance in the Member's DROP account payable at the option of the terminated DROP participant, or if deceased, such participant's designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, shall be distributed, to the extent allowed by law, by rollover to another qualified plan, as a lump sum payment, or as a combination of both, as provided by rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees; provided that such distribution may be adjusted by City Council to maintain Internal Revenue Code qualification of the Fund. 
2.  If a DROP participant dies during the DROP calculation period, or on or before the DROP participant's full DROP accumulation is distributed, any remaining DROP accumulation shall be distributed to the DROP participant's designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, or, if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary, to the participant's spouse, or if there is no surviving designated Beneficiary and no surviving spouse, to the participant's estate. Any such payment shall be made in a lump sum payment, unless the participant had already commenced benefit payment of their DROP accumulation in an optional plan.

(G)  Administration of program. The Board of Trustees shall make such rules as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this Section, provided that such rules are not inconsistent with the terms of any collective bargaining agreement entered into by the City and the certified bargaining agents for Police Officers concerning the DROP. The Board of Trustees shall not be required to advise Members of the Federal tax consequences of an election related to the DROP but may advise Members to seek independent advice.

The Share Program is a program within the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund. Accordingly, the definitions, conditions, limitations, forfeiture for cause, non-alienation, and all other provisions of Article IV shall be considered applicable unless superseded by more specific language contained in this Section. 
(A)  Shares to be credited annually. Credits and allocations to the share accounts shall be determined annually based upon the receipt by the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund of any "additional premium tax revenues" as defined in F.S. § 185.35(1)(b). By December 1 of each year (or, if the premium tax revenues are received after December 2, within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the premium tax revenues from the state), the share account of each active Police Officer or DROP participant shall be credited with the supplemental retirement benefit.

Each active Police Officer or DROP participant who was employed during the preceding calendar year or who was serving in the Armed Forces of the United States as defined in subsection (d) of the definition of "Creditable service" under Section 17-403 shall receive one share for each full calendar month of Creditable service, as defined in Section 17-403, accrued as of December 31 of said preceding year. 
2.  The total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the additional premium tax revenues received during said year to determine the value of each share to be credited to the share account of each eligible Member. 
3.  Should the payment of additional premium tax revenues be delayed until the following calendar year, the calculation and crediting of shares shall be based upon the year in which the revenues were originally payable. 
(D)  Investment return on share accounts.

The investment returns, net of the costs, expenses and fees associated with the implementation, operation and administration of the Share Program shall be allocated to the share accounts annually.

Any allocation to a share participant's account shall be net of the participant's allocable portion of the Share Program's costs, expenses and fees of implementing, operating and administrating the Share Program based upon the participant's accrued Creditable service during the relevant period. If the cost, expenses and fees of implementing, operating or administering the Share Program exceed the assets of the Share Program, Members of the Share Program shall pay their prorata share of such costs, expenses and fees. 
(F)  Payment of costs, expenses and fees. All costs, expenses and fees of implementing, operating and administering the Share Program, shall be paid solely from the assets of the Share Program.

(G)  Vesting of share accounts. A Member with ten (10) years of Creditable service with the City, upon termination of employment as an active Police Officer or DROP participant shall be eligible to receive one hundred (100) percent of the balance in his or her share account. No benefit shall be payable to a Member who terminates employment with the City having less than ten (10) years of City Creditable service, except as specified in paragraphs (H) and (I) below. The share account balances of such non-vested, terminated Members shall be redistributed into the allocation for the next fiscal year. 
(H)  Death or disability. The designated Beneficiary of a Member who dies shall receive the accumulated total of the Member's share account. A Member awarded a disability Pension from the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund shall receive the accumulated total of his or her share account. There shall be no forfeiture of a Member's share account prior to the completion ten (10) years of Creditable service if the Member terminates employment due to death or disability. 
(I)  Layoff. The accumulated share account of a Member who is laid off with recall rights prior to completing ten (10) years of Creditable service shall be held in escrow for the period during which the Member is entitled to be recalled to City employment. Should such laid off Member return to City service in a position covered by the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund during such recall period, his or her share account balance will begin to accrue once again, but without any credit for the period of layoff. 
(J)  Payout of share account balances. Payment of share account benefits shall be by lump sum and shall occur as soon as possible following the annual valuation date which next follows the Member's termination from active employment as an active Police Officer, DROP participant or the award of disability Retirement benefits. Such payment shall consist of the accumulated total of the Member's share account or rollover in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, or a combination thereof, with an additional distribution made for any amount credited likewise in the year following termination of employment.

The costs incurred by the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund for any actuarial, administrative, or attorney services required to respond to attempted qualified domestic relations orders, income deduction orders, or other matters involving the calculation or division of a Member's share account due to a dissolution of marriage, shall be deducted from the Member's share account. No payouts of a share account shall be made on account of dissolution of marriage. Payouts can only be made after termination of employment. 
(L)  No City liability. The City shall incur no liability or responsibility for the payment of share accounts or for the investment return accrued to share accounts. Any additional costs of additional minimum or mandated Pension benefits required by changes to federal or state law that take effect after the date of this ordinance shall be paid from the additional premium tax revenues, exclusive of any amounts required to meet the minimum requirements of Florida Statutes Chapter 185, and/or other previously granted extra benefits, before any remaining additional premium tax revenues are allocated to the share accounts hereunder. 
(M)  City responsibilities. The City shall have no responsibility for the operation or administration of, or provision of customer service for, the Share Program. The City shall not be required to levy any additional taxes on its residents or to make any contributions to the Share Program.

2.  Upon termination of this Share Program, the Share Program assets shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with the accrual formula set forth herein. 
(O)  Compliance with Internal Revenue Code. If it is determined by the Internal Revenue Service Code that any provision of the Share Program which cannot be corrected, or the operation or administration of the Share Program that cannot be corrected, such as to disqualify the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund from being tax exempt under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, then all assets of the Share Program shall be used to provide "extra benefits" in such a manner as to not disqualify the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund. 
(P)  Cost of claims to the City. The Board of Trustees of the Pinellas Park Police Officers' Pension Fund, solely out of the assets of the Share Program, shall reimburse the City of Pinellas Park and its officers, agents, staff, and employees for all of its financial losses due to any claims, demands, damages, fines, expenses, fees, suits, proceedings, actions and costs of actions, including appeals, and including attorneys' fees of any kind or nature arising from the creation, implementation, operation, and administration of the Share Program.

Article 3. Parkland Dedication 

Sec. 18-301. - FINDINGS. 
    WHEREAS, the City of Pinellas Park has experienced a rapid population increase due to new residential development resulting from the expansion of commercial and industrial properties, and the general growth of Pinellas County; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, continued population growth will result in a reduction in the amount of land suitable for parkland and recreational purposes and consequently place an undue burden on those parklands and recreational facilities currently available for each resident of the City; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, it has been found that a healthy and productive community depends, in part, on the availability of parkland and recreational facilities; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, it is recognized that the provision of adequate parklands and recreational facilities to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of each new residential development within the City of Pinellas Park is just as important to proper land development as are streets, water, sewer, and sidewalks; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, because of such new population growth, the City will be required to obtain additional parklands and recreational facilities; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, new residential developments should share in the cost of providing those additional parklands and recreational facilities which will be necessitated by their construction; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, requiring the dedication of land and facilities for parklands and recreational facilities or payment in lieu thereof by each residential developer or builder is a fair and equitable method of providing such additional parklands and recreational facilities; and (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
    WHEREAS, in some instances, the developer or builder of a residential development will provide private parkland and recreational facilities for the residents of such development and that consequently, the provision for such facilities will result in a reduced need for and impact on municipal parklands and recreational facilities. Thus, a method should be established whereby the developer or builder may be issued a credit for such private parklands and recreational facilities in proportion to that which would have been required based on the provisions contained within this Article 3 of the Land Development Code. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-302. - PURPOSE. 
    The purpose of Article 3 "Parkland Dedication", is to identify those minimum standards for parkland and recreational facilities which have been found to be necessary and proper for the public interest, convenience, health, safety, and welfare, and to develop guidelines and establish a mechanism which will ensure that adequate parklands and recreational facilities are available to current and future residents of the City of Pinellas Park. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-303. - DEFINITIONS.

(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-305. - STANDARDS. 
(A)  RESIDENT POPULATION FACTORS. It is recognized that the ultimate density of a proposed residential development bears directly on the amount of parkland and recreational facilities required to serve the residents of such development. In light of this fact, the following is a listing of those persons per unit factors which are indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new residential construction: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
TYPE OF UNIT TOTAL PERSONS PER UNIT One bedroom (e.g. efficiencies) 1.25 Two bedrooms 2.5 Three or more bedrooms 3.5 Institutions: (e.g. nursing homes ACLF's, and facilities for the elderly) (excluding hospitals and incarceration centers.) 1/person/bed or unit NOTE: If an institution with group facilities is a conditional use, then the resident population factor shall be calculated upon the basis of the maximum permitted density.  
(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(B)  RESIDENT POPULATION FORMULA. Employing the persons per unit standard set forth above, the resident population of the land to be developed shall be determined by multiplying the number of units proposed on a site plan or building permit application by the standards of persons per unit. This formula is expressed as follows: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986)

2.  EASEMENTS, RESTRICTIONS, RESERVATIONS, OR ENCUMBRANCES. 
(a)  The land deeded or designated for parkland and recreational purposes shall not be subject to any easements, restrictions, reservations, or encumbrances of any kind, which, in the opinion of the City Attorney, will unreasonably interfere with the use of such land for parkland and recreational purposes. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(b)  Where any such easements, restrictions, reservations, or encumbrances exist, the City shall require the payment in lieu of dedication of the lands unless City Council chooses to accept the land subject thereto. Such acceptance shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate documents by the City Attorney. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
3.  STATUS OF TITLE. The developer or builder shall, in all instances, provide to the City an ownership and encumbrance report prepared by an acceptable title insurance company or a title opinion from an attorney admitted to the Florida Bar showing the state of the title of the property to be deeded or designated.

(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-307. - STANDARDS FOR ACCEPTANCE OF LAND AND FACILITIES.

(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-308. - PARKLAND DEDICATION FEE. 
(A)  Should the developer or builder decide not to dedicate parkland and recreational facilities to the City of Pinellas Park or City Council decline to accept such dedication, then the developer or builder shall pay a parkland dedication fee in lieu thereof. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(B)  The amount of such parkland dedication fee shall be calculated as follows: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
1.  The resident population figure for each type of residential unit multiplied by the Recreation Impact Fee/Person. This formula is expressed as follows: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Resident Population x Recreation Impact Fee/Person = Total Parkland Dedication Fee. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
2.  This procedure is repeated for each residential unit type; the individual totals are then added together in order to ascertain the total amount of parkland dedication fee due. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
3.  The following is an example of this calculation, using a residential development of one hundred (100) homes, twenty-five (25) one-bedroom and seventy-five (75) two-bedroom: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(25 units x 1.25 factor) x $261.84 = $8,182.50 (75 units x 2.50 factor) x $261.84 = $49,095.00 Total Parkland Dedication Fee $57,277.50

Sec. 18-309. - APPLICATION FOR CREDIT FOR PRIVATE PARKLANDS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES. 
    Where a parkland dedication fee has been paid and the developer or builder provides private parklands and/or private recreational facilities, a credit may be given against the amount of parkland dedication fee required by this Article 3 of the Land Development Code. The following requirements are to be complied with before any such credit may be allowed: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986)

(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(B)  The application for a parkland dedication fee credit shall include a site plan identifying the private parklands and private recreational facilities for which the credit is requested and specifications of those recreational facilities (e.g. square footage). The site plan shall contain such additional information deemed necessary by the Zoning Director. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Sec. 18-310. - CALCULATION OF CREDIT. 
    Upon submission of the above information, the Zoning Division shall calculate the amount of the credit. This calculation shall be based on the following: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986)

(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(B)  Whether any proposed usable open space is in fact usable, as defined in this Article 3 of the Land Development Code. (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
(C)  USABLE OPEN SPACE. The method for calculating any credit for usable open space shall be as follows: (Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986) 
Resident Population of Development × .003 = Required Usable Open Space 
Usable Open Space Provided - Required Usable Open Space = Usable Open Space Available for Credit 
Usable Open Space Available for Credit × $65,400/acre = Credit 
(Ord. No. 1601, 4-10-1986)

(D)  WETLAND REPLACEMENT. The replacement requirements for legally removed wetlands shall be defined on a square footage basis and shall use a minimum, one (1) acre (or portion thereof) created for each acre (or portion thereof) adversely impacted. Each acre composed of a naturally occurring diversity of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation, to reestablish the wetland habitat with eighty-five (85) percent coverage within three (3) years. Replanted areas shall be planted with a minimum of one (1) replant tree per two hundred (200) square feet, and naturally occurring shrub and ground cover shall be replanted on three-foot centers. Where suitable habitat for said wetlands no longer exists the replacement requirements shall be based on other tree species with comparable canopy. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990; Ord. No. 2310, 2-23-1995) 
(E)  UPLAND BUFFERS ADJACENT TO WETLANDS. 
1.  PURPOSE. It is the purpose of an upland buffer to further protect wetlands, their associated wildlife and water quality and quantity attributes from adjacent development impacts. Such impacts include siltation, eutrophication, noise, artificial light intrusion and human and domestic animal intrusion. Upland buffers will also provide preservation of upland wildlife habitat. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
2.  UPLAND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS. Upland buffers shall be required immediately adjacent to a wetland in accordance with Table I, Standard Upland Buffer Width, or as otherwise specified in this Section. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
The upland buffers must be shown on a site plan and must be preserved during site development. Platted single-family lots and sites with development approved through previous Site Plan Review procedures of the City of Pinellas Park, which received approval prior to adoption of Ordinance No. 2039 shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section, unless they fall within the redevelopment criteria specified in Section 18-1512.6(E) "Landscape Standards for Sites Proposing Building and/or Vehicular Use Area Expansion" of the Land Development Code. The upland buffer shall be recorded as a conservation easement on the recorded plat for the development. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990; Ord. No. 2310, 2-23-1995) 
TABLE 1 
Standard Upland Buffer Width (feet) (a) Isolated wetlands 15 (b) Natural creeks or other waterways which are designated as Preservation Land Use Areas which are connected with waters of the State as defined in the Florida Administrative Code 15 outside the top bank or contiguous wetlands whichever is greater (c) All significant wetlands which meet the definition of waters of the State 50  
3.  ALTERNATIVE UPLAND BUFFER PLAN. Upon approval of the City Manager, or his designee, an applicant may reduce the buffer width up to one-third ( 1/3 ) the values in Table I, Standard Upland Buffer Width (e.g. fifteen (15) feet reduced to ten (10) feet or fifty (50) feet reduced to thirty-three (33) feet) by providing additional width in one (1) section of the buffer and correspondingly reduce the buffer width in another section to result in an equivalent or greater square footage. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
An applicant may choose to enhance a buffer utilizing additional plant material, topographic changes or other measures in order to reduce the buffer requirement. An enhanced upland buffer area shall be planted with one (1) replant tree per four hundred (400) square feet, and naturally occurring shrub and ground cover shall be replanted on three-foot centers. Such an Upland Buffer Enhancement Plan shall be presented to the City Manager, or his designee, for approval and if approved shall permit the applicant to reduce the buffer width up to one-third ( 1/3 ) of the values of Table I, Standard Upland Buffer Widths. (e.g. fifteen (15) feet reduced to ten (10) feet or fifty (50) feet reduced to thirty-three (33) feet). (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
(F)  UPLAND PRESERVATION AREAS. 
1.  PURPOSE. It is the purpose of an upland preservation area to provide for the preservation of viable upland wildlife habitats and representative native vegetative plant communities. The protection of these areas will help to ensure that adequate feeding, nesting and cover necessary for the continued survival of native wildlife species is available while protecting naturally occurring vegetative plant communities. (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
2.  UPLAND PRESERVATION AREA REQUIREMENTS. Any site with five (5) acres or greater of contiguous ownership shall be required to preserve a minimum of three (3) percent of the upland portion of a parcel as an upland preservation area. The upland preservation area must be shown on the site plan and must be preserved during site development. The upland preservation area for one (1) or more parcels may be provided on one (1) or more other parcels if all parcels are contiguous and are considered as a single development under unified control. All land area contained within and as part of upland preservation areas shall be credited one hundred (100) percent toward the open space requirements. Furthermore, if the required establishment of an upland preservation area leads to unusual hardship in the development of the site, the City Manager, or his designee may allow for reduction in green space buffer requirements. The request for a reduction in green space buffer requirements will be evaluated on a site-by-site basis and in accordance with the following criteria: (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990) 
(a)  The unique characteristics of the site, including but not limited to, location, size, dimensional configuration, type of soil, the existence of nuisance exotic vegetation, the existence of nuisance trees or shrubs, etc.; (Ord. No. 2039, 8-23-1990)

(a)  Tree Replacement. The replacement of a tree or trees on the parcel in violation shall be in sufficient number so that the sum of the DBH of the replacement trees complies to part (a) of the Sliding Scale. The number and size of trees violated may be determined by surveys, field inspection, aerial interpretation, or statistical analysis of trees on adjacent properties. If the number of required replacement trees, as derived from this method, exceeds the holding capacity of the parcel in violation, the required replacement trees which do not fit on the parcel in violation may be placed in the City's Tree Bank for later planting on public school and/or on City owned properties; or (Ord. No. 2146, 4-23-1992; Ord. No. 3605, § 3, 1-24-2008) 
(b)  If the holding capacity of the parcel in violation does not permit tree replacement on the parcel in violation, a cash penalty totalling the value of the tree(s) violated, as derived by the cash value of the ISA Formula of part (b) of the Sliding Scale, will be calculated. This cash penalty shall be paid by the violator to the City's Tree Bank for the purchase of tree(s) to be planted on property as described in Subsection 18-402 "DEFINITIONS"/TREE BANK above; or (Ord. No. 2146, 4-23-1992; Ord. No. 3605, § 3, 1-24-2008)

The replacement of a tree or trees on the parcel in violation in sufficient number so that the sum of the DBH of the replacement trees equals or exceeds the DBH of the tree(s) that were cut down, damaged, hatracked, poisoned or in any other manner destroyed without a permit. The number and size of trees violated may be determined by surveys, field inspection, aerial interpretation, or statistical analysis of trees on adjacent properties. If the number of required replacement trees, as derived from this method, exceeds the holding capacity of the parcel in violation, the required replacement trees which do not fit on the parcel in violation may be placed in the City's Tree Bank for later planting on public school and/or City owned properties; or (Ord. No. 2146, 4-23-1992; Ord. No. 3605, § 3, 1-24-2008) 
(b)  If the holding capacity of the parcel in violation does not permit tree replacement on the parcel in violation, a cash penalty totalling the value of the tree(s) violated, as derived by the International Society of Arboriculture Shade Tree Value Formula, will be calculated. This cash penalty shall be paid by the violator to the City's Tree Bank for the purchase of tree(s) to be planted on property as described in Subsection 18-402 "DEFINITIONS"/TREE BANK above. (Ord. No. 2146, 4-23-1992; Ord. No. 3605, § 3, 1-24-2008)

Sec. 18-602. - PURPOSE, INTENT AND SCOPE. 
    It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this Article are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects of speech and especially insofar as those secondary effects may adversely affect aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety, and are narrowly drawn and tailored to achieve those goals. In order to preserve and enhance Pinellas Park as a desirable community in which to live and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the City of Pinellas Park is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. These sign regulations have been prepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the City of Pinellas Park and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended to: 
(a)  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communications in the City; 
(b)  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
(c)  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(d)  Minimize the possible adverse affect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
(e)  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
(f)  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(g)  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
(h)  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use, activity and function to which they pertain; 
(i)  Curtail the size and number of signs and sign messages to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business; 
(j)  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
(k)  Categorize signs based upon the function that they serve and tailor the regulation of signs based upon their function; 
(l)  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining sites; 
(m)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(n)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(o)  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all districts of the City; 
(p)  Allow for traffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream; 
(q)  Protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign-types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(r)  Protect property values by ensuring that sign-types, as well as the number of signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area; 
(s)  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the City and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of this City's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for the community; and 
(t)  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these Sign Regulations.

(Ord. No. 3948, § 1, 6-25-2015) 
Sec. 18-1-801.2. - SCOPE. 
    The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 3948, § 1, 6-25-2015) 
Sec. 18-1-801.3. - INTENT. 
    The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

Sec. 18-1503.4. - LOTS, YARDS AND OPEN SPACE, GENERALLY. 
    No lot area or dimension shall be reduced or diminished so that the lot, yards, open spaces or other dimensional requirement shall be smaller than prescribed by this Article, nor shall the density of population, impervious area, building coverage or bulk be increased in any manner, except in conformity with the regulations established herein. No space which has been counted or calculated as part of a lot, yard or other open space required by this Article for any building may be counted or calculated to satisfy or comply with a lot, yard or other open space requirement of, or for, any other building. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.5. - DIVISION OF LOTS/UNITY OF TITLE DOCUMENTS. 
(A)  No lot improved with a building or buildings shall hereafter be divided into two (2) or more lots, and no portion of any lot shall be divided or sold separately from the entirety of the lot, unless all lots and improvements thereon, following any division or sale, shall conform with all the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(B)  The City may require owners of developed lots comprising: 1) more than one (1) lot of record; or 2) one (1) lot of record large enough to be subdivided in compliance with minimum required lot area and dimensions of this Article, to execute a "Lot Line Adjustment" or "Unity of Title" document pursuant to Section 18-101.5 of the Land Development Code, , which shall be recorded through the City Clerk's Office. This shall be required when the City Manager determines it to be necessary in order to ensure that the lot(s) shall not subsequently be subdivided, transferred, conveyed or sold in any manner that creates or exacerbates a violation of the provisions of this Article. 
(C)  The recorded document required above shall stipulate that a lot or lots shall be held under single ownership, shall not be eligible for further subdivision and shall not be transferred, conveyed, sold or divided in any unit other than in its entirety. If a lot or lots are controlled by a Unity of Title, the City Manager may release the Unity of Title for justified cause. In any case where a waiver or variance, other than an administrative variance, of any provision of Chapter 18 would be necessary prior to release of the Unity of Title, then City Council shall approve or deny the release of the recorded Unity of Title. Lot(s) that are controlled by a Unity of Title document may be subdivided if the Unity of title is released and all requirements of this Article are met.

Sec. 18-1503.8. - MEASUREMENTS OF YARD SETBACKS ON LOTS ADJACENT TO RIGHTS-OF-WAY OF INSUFFICIENT WIDTH. 
(A)  In any case where a proposed or existing lot abuts a planned or existing right-of-way which does not yet have the full dedicated right-of-way width as presented in Article 1, Subdivision Code, the Comprehensive Plan, a City Thoroughfare Plan, or as required by another governmental agency having jurisdiction over the right-of-way, the yard setbacks for such properties for all improvements, including but not limited to buildings, structures, signs, landscaping, drainage ponds, and buffers, shall be measured from the ultimate right-of-way lines. This requirement shall not apply to developed parcels on existing local streets where the Future Traffic Circulation Plan does not indicate a change of functional classification to a higher classification that also requires a greater right-of-way width and the requirements of Section 18-105.5(A), (C) and (D) do not apply. 
(B)  An applicant may request a waiver of a City right-of-way width requirement by making written application for a waiver to the City Council. The City Council shall grant or deny the application based on the following factors: 
1.  The impact that the applicant's proposal would have on the existing and proposed right-of-way in the area; 
2.  The location of the applicant's property; 
3.  Traffic patterns in the area; 
4.  The character and age of the neighborhood; and 
5.  Any other factor that is relevant and material to the waiver request. 
In granting such waivers, the City Council shall find that such waiver will not be contrary to the public interest and may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards. A violation of such conditions and safeguards shall be deemed a violation of this Article.

(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.12. - TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. 
(A)  PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this Section to establish a procedure and guidelines by which the Community Redevelopment Agency may authorize the transfer of development rights consistent with the public health, safety and welfare within the Community Redevelopment District (CRD) Land Use Plan Map category. 
(B)  APPLICABILITY. This Section shall apply only to properties within the Community Redevelopment District (CRD) Land Use Plan Map category which are to be developed utilizing a transfer of development right. The "Transfer of Development Rights" shall only apply to density, residential equivalency, floor area ratio and maximum lot coverage. The total development rights of parcels shall be limited to expressions of density or intensity available to the area of the parcel consistent with the Community Redevelopment Plan. The use of property developed with transferable development rights shall be controlled by the underlying zoning district, Comprehensive Plan and/or Special Area Plan applicable to the parcel. The merit of any proposed "Transfer of Development Rights" as provided in this Section shall be decided by the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
(C)  ELIGIBILITY. Owners of real property located within the Community Redevelopment District. 
1.  Owners of undeveloped real property located within the community redevelopment district shall be eligible to apply for the "Transfer of Development Rights" from such property (sending parcel) to other property located within the community redevelopment district (receiving parcel). There shall be no transfer of development rights from existing developed properties irrespective of whether or not that property has been developed to the maximum density/intensity permitted. Existing, developed lots shall be presumed to have exhausted all unit development rights and shall not claim additional unit rights on the basis of the density or intensity assignment relative to the Official Land Use Map classification. This shall not preclude the right of that owner to expand an existing home's living area, expand a business or to add accessory uses consistent with the Land Development Code. 
2.  Density/intensity of receiving parcels may exceed by no more than twenty-five (25) percent the density/intensity assigned or achievable by the Community Redevelopment Plan. 
3.  The density/intensity of the transferring (sending) parcel shall thereafter be limited to the remnant use if all development rights are transferred. Prior to transferring any density/intensity, the Zoning Division shall quantify the total and/or remaining development rights associated with the sending parcel. 
(D)  PROCEDURE. Any proposed transfer of development rights, as identified in Subsection (B) above, shall be processed as follows: 
1.  Only the Community Redevelopment Agency may authorize the transfer of development rights consistent with the guidelines of this Section. 
2.  A request for a transfer of development rights shall be submitted to the Zoning Division on a form provided by the City with such information as may be determined by the Zoning Director to be necessary to evaluate the request and a review and advertising fee. A request shall not be considered until public notice has been given of the public hearings by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Community Redevelopment Agency. The provisions of Section 18-1534, Public Notice Requirements" shall apply. The Community Redevelopment Agency, after review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the transfer consistent with the review guidelines of this Section. 
3.  Any action by the Community Redevelopment Agency to approve the requested transfer shall be so noted on the approved site plan and building permit, as applicable, together with any conditions. 
4.  Any property owner(s) who has had such transfer authorized by the Community Redevelopment Agency shall record a covenant or other appropriate legal instrument, as devised by the County, with the Clerk of the Circuit Court so as to constitute a public record setting forth the details and the conditions of any "Transfer of Development Rights." The instrument shall stipulate any remaining development right for the sending parcel as determined by the Zoning Division. Prior to recording, the completed instrument shall be reviewed by the Zoning Director for consistency with this section. Upon written notification from the Director that the instrument meets the requirements of this section, the applicant shall record the instrument and direct the Clerk of Court to transmit four (4) certified copies thereof to the Director for distribution to the file, City Clerk and Building Official. Additionally, a record copy shall be transmitted to the Pinellas Planning Council for acceptance and filing. 
(E)  GUIDELINES FOR REVIEW. In reviewing any request for transfer of development rights, the Community Redevelopment Agency shall be guided by the following criteria: 
1.  The unique limitations and conditions characterizing and affecting the property from which and to which the development rights are proposed to be transferred. Such unique limitations and conditions may include, but are not limited to, characteristics of the property such as: Lot size, location, configuration and access; physical characteristics such as topography, soils, vegetative cover, environmental sensitivity, wildlife habitat and water bodies; and regulatory measures and restraints as they relate to the characteristics of the property and its ability to be used in a reasonable manner. 
2.  The ramifications to the receiving site as a result of the transfer relative to open space, building bulk, height and setbacks, as well as related site improvements, such as parking, recreation and service areas. The Community Redevelopment Agency shall evaluate and make findings of fact as to the extent of any variances and/or waivers from any applicable standard that is necessitated by such transfer, the acceptability or unacceptability of such variance and/or waiver as it relates to the site plan in question and the reasons therefore. 
3.  The public interest and benefit, if any, as such interest and benefit may be affected by the proposed transfer. Such public interest and benefit may include, but is not limited to: preservation or enhancement of significant environmental features, floodplain management, open space, recreational opportunities, community appearance, aesthetics, views, traffic flow or control; beneficial relationship to adjoining uses, specific target neighborhood or redevelopment objectives, resource and energy conservation; and requirements for public services and utilities. 
4.  The Community Redevelopment Agency shall not approve any transfer of development rights where a finding has been made by the Agency that such transfer would be detrimental to the public interest based on safety, economic, environmental, recreational or community appearance considerations, and the Community Redevelopment Agency shall not approve any transfer of development rights to a property which would establish a use that is not consistent with the applicable zoning district or Land Use Plan Map category or adopted special area plan (Community Redevelopment Plan).

Sec. 18-1503.13. - EXCLUSION FROM HEIGHT LIMITS. 
(A)  Rooftop projections such as, but not limited to, penthouses containing mechanical equipment, parapet walls not to exceed five (5) feet in height to conceal mechanical equipment or to add architectural features to a façade, spires, steeples, domes and other decorative projections, tanks, chimneys, stacks, and flagpoles may exceed the stated height limit for a given zoning district, provided that such projections shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the total roof area of the building or structure and that no such projection shall exceed the stated height limit by more than twenty-five (25) percent or thirty (30) feet, whichever is less. 
(B)  Antennae may exceed the stated height limit as provided in the antenna and telecommunication tower provisions of Section 18-1530.7, Section 1530.8 and Section 18-1530.9. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.14. - MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT. 
(A)  Nonresidential Zoning Districts. All mechanical equipment other than accessory equipment for residential uses, and all refrigeration units, shall be placed in a location as far as possible from any abutting and functionally abutting residential zoning district so that noise and exhaust is kept away from any abutting or functionally abutting residential zoning district. If structurally buffered with a solid masonry wall, such equipment may be placed on the sides of the building. However, mechanical equipment must meet the required setbacks. 
(B)  Residential Zoning Districts. Mechanical equipment or appurtenances, such as air conditioning compressors; pumps and fans; pool pumps and filtration systems; propane or other fuel tanks; generators or other electrical power generating devices; when attached to a dwelling or other accessory structure on a residential lot are regarded as structures and are required to meet structure setback requirements for the zoning district in which they are located. The City recognizes that nuisances related to noise and aesthetics can be abated through architectural design, placement, visual screening, acoustical enclosure or other methods that, when properly designed and executed, can ameliorate and/or eliminate nuisance impacts to adjacent properties and the street. In furtherance of this concept, when a property and/or structure can demonstrate that any one of the following site conditions can be met when attaching noise producing or other mechanical equipment as listed above, a variance to setbacks for mechanical equipment will not be required: 
1.  Twenty (20) feet or greater distance between structures and equipment is screened with a six (6) solid fence or wall with hedge plants on the outside face of the screen. 
2.  At least ten (10) feet distance between residences and no wall openings (windows/doors) exist on the adjacent residence unless the opening is into a garage. 
3.  Fifteen (15) feet distance between residences and one (1) non-garage wall opening on the adjacent residence that is at least twenty (20) feet away from the equipment pad as measured along the side yard property line and screened by a six (6) feet high solid fence buffered with hedge plants on the outside face of the screen. 
4.  Ten (10) feet between residences and motorized equipment (pump/compressor) is enclosed with an acoustical enclosure certified by an acoustical engineer to reduce sound as measured one (1) foot inside the adjacent residence's side yard to a minimum of fifty-five (55) decibels. 
    Furthermore, screening should be established at a minimum of eighteen (18) inches or manufacturer's recommendation away from motorized equipment to insure proper function of the equipment. Residents are encouraged to inspect their systems regularly to insure that housing screws are properly tightened to reduce rattle and that fans are adequately lubricated. A well maintained system helps to not only extend the functional life of a system, it helps to reduce noises that can negatively impact neighbors and your own indoor and outdoor living spaces as well. 
    All quiescent mechanical equipment such as, but not limited to, propane or other fuel tanks, pool filtration systems, solar panels or other equipment, that does not generate noise, when visually screened from abutting residential properties and streets with vegetation, fences or walls to the satisfaction of the Zoning Director, shall not require a setback variance. If vegetative screening is used then the vegetation must be kept alive and in good condition. If the screen is allowed to deteriorate to a condition that allows view from abutting lots or the street, or the screen itself becomes a visually blighting appurtenance, the property owner will be subject to the issuance of a compliance citation requiring reestablishment of the screen or be directed through the variance process. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.15. - ILLUMINATION. 
    All outdoor lighting shall be designed and situated so as to maximize containment of the emitted illumination on the subject lot. No spill-over lighting shall be directed onto any abutting lot. The provisions of this paragraph shall be achieved, insofar as possible, through the use of cut-off fixtures so that the line of illumination does not intrude onto an abutting lot. Further, no outdoor lighting shall be directed at angles that interfere with driver vision on adjacent roadways. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.16. - DETERMINING ALLOWABLE DENSITY FOR CERTAIN LAND USES THAT PROVIDE FOR OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS. 
    Allowable density for land uses such as, but not limited to, hospitals, nursing homes, congregate living facilities, personal care homes, bed and breakfast establishments and similar uses shall be based upon an equivalent residential unit (ERU) of 3.0 beds per dwelling unit allowed by the particular zoning district in which such use is proposed. Density/intensity for hotels/motels shall be determined consistently with applicable zoning district regulations and Future Land Use Classification. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1503.17. - ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOTELS AND MOTELS. 
    Higher densities (units per acre of land) for temporary lodging facilities can be achieved by following the guidelines, standards and review processes established in the Countywide Plan Rules, Pinellas County Ordinance 2007-50 modified herein as follows: 
(A)  Eligible Areas for Establishment. Hotels/Motels may be established at densities determined by the Future Land Use Category of the site as follows:

(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
SECTION 18-1504. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 18-1504.1. - STATEMENT OF INTENT. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this Section to permit any lawfully established lot, building and other structures (all deemed "buildings" hereunder), or use, existing as of the effective date of this Article, or of amendments thereto, which do not conform to the adopted regulations of the district in which it is located, to continue as a nonconformity, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1504.2. - NONCONFORMING USES. 
(A)  VESTED RIGHTS. Any building designed for a nonconforming use for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this Article, or of amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within one hundred and eighty-two (182) days of the date of issue of the building permit and the permit remains valid. Necessary changes during the construction period of the permit will be permitted; such changes need not conform to the newly adopted Article or amendments thereto but must meet the regulations that were in force at the time of issuance of the building permit. Such building designed for a nonconforming use, shall thereafter be deemed a lawfully established building. Any nonconforming use of the building shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. This Subsection is not intended to extend the effective time of any building permit granted pursuant to this Article, or any ordinance, rule, or regulation of the City. 
(B)  DISCONTINUANCE OF USE. Nonconforming uses shall not be permitted to continue if said use becomes subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Period of Discontinuance. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, except as provided under (I), "Damage - Destruction" such use shall not be re-established. This condition shall not apply to residential uses, which may continue to exist until the nonconforming residential use is converted to a conforming use. 
2.  Discontinuance of Use on Undeveloped Land. Undeveloped land, used in this context, shall refer to land that does not contain any enclosed building. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use on undeveloped land for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) consecutive days constitutes abandonment, after which use of said undeveloped land shall conform with the regulations of the applicable zoning district, except when the nonconforming use is either farming, agriculture or animal husbandry, such use may be re-established, if done so within a period of twelve (12) months from the date of discontinuance. 
(C)  CONVERSION TO NONCONFORMING USE NOT PERMITTED. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to, or replaced by, a use conforming to the provisions of this Article, such nonconforming use shall not be re-established. 
(D)  CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE. The nonconforming use of any building, or portion thereof may be changed to another nonconforming use of equal or lesser intensity, if the City Council, or Community Redevelopment Agency if located within the Community Redevelopment Area, determines after the conclusion of a public hearing, that the building is structurally and uniquely designed for a nonconforming use, and/or the site is also designed for a nonconforming use, and that the proposed change in use is of equal or lesser intensity. Notice for the public hearing shall be as prescribed for waivers under Section 18-1534, Public Notice Requirements. 
In determining whether a change in nonconforming use is of equal or lesser intensity, the appropriate board shall consider parking requirements and traffic generation, the characteristics of the use itself, infrastructure demand, and compatibility with neighboring uses. 
In determining whether a building is structurally and uniquely designed for a nonconforming use, the appropriate reviewing board shall consider the adaptability of the structural building design and site layout for conforming uses, but without consideration of interior partition wall layout, portable furnishings or portable equipment. An example of a building structurally designed for a unique use is an auditorium with sloped floor, fixed seating, balconies, orchestra pit and elevated stage. Other examples of both buildings and their sites designed uniquely for specific uses include some very small fast-food restaurants as characterized by their small shell, small site and drive-thru lanes; marinas; dead/long-term storage warehouses with remote location and insufficient parking area to accommodate other uses; service stations with motor fuel pumps; and, buildings structurally designed for a specific heavy-industrial use, which buildings are not adaptable to other use types. 
When reviewing an application for a change of nonconforming use, the appropriate reviewing board may approve, approve with conditions or safeguards, or deny the proposed change of nonconforming use. The approval of the change of nonconforming use shall not become effective except by a majority vote of the City Council or, if applicable, by the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the change of nonconforming use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Article and punishable as such. 
(E)  ADDITIONS-EXPANSIONS. Buildings containing nonconforming uses may make such additions, or expand the space occupied by a nonconforming use located within a building, in order to provide for the natural expansion of the nonconforming use, as determined by City Council, or if appropriate, by the Community Redevelopment Agency, should the use be located within the Community Redevelopment District. Refer to Subsection (D), above, for public hearing procedures and criteria to be considered by the reviewing agency. 
In granting approval of any addition or expansion, the City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Article. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the addition or expansion of a building containing a nonconforming use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Article and punishable as such. 
Exception: Nonconforming single-family detached dwellings shall not be required to meet the public hearing requirement noted in (D) above when the proposed expansion involves the following accessory uses customarily found in residential developments: screen rooms, carports, utility sheds, swimming pools, pool cages, decks, and patios. All other expansions to a nonconforming single-family detached dwelling must meet applicable Code requirements, including but not limited to, review and approval at a public hearing by the appropriate reviewing agency. 
(F)  MOVING. A nonconforming use can be moved within the lot of record upon which situated, as it existed on the effective date of this Article, provided the relocation of the use complies with all property development standards and requirements of this Article, other than those pertaining to lot size and dimensions 
(G)  ENCROACHMENT NOT PERMITTED. Nonconforming uses may not be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any land beyond the boundaries of the lot upon which it is situated, as it existed on the effective date of this Article. 
(H)  REPAIR-ALTERATIONS. Normal maintenance of a building containing a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary structural repairs and interior or exterior alterations which do not increase the exterior size of the building. This provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the exterior repair or alteration of a building by means of the use of aluminum siding or similar material or where the installation meets energy efficiency codes. 
(I)  DAMAGE-DESTRUCTION. If a building containing a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means beyond the control of the owner, such damaged building can be rebuilt as originally constructed. The building may be restored to its original configuration and the occupancy or use of such building which existed at the time of such destruction may be continued. However, said building must meet current Code requirements of Florida Building Code, as it may be amended from time to time, as well as the requirements of Article 8, Flood Damage Control, Land Development Code. In any event, restoration or repair of the building must have commenced within a period of twelve (12) months from the date of damage or destruction, and diligently pursued to completion, provided that in the event of a natural disaster, the City Manager may extend this timeframe for all buildings within the City as needed to accommodate recovery on a large-scale. 
(J)  REPLACEMENT OF NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOME DWELLINGS. The replacement of mobile home dwellings, and accessory uses normally associated with said use such as screen rooms or carports, located within an established mobile home park that is nonconforming to the zoning district, shall not be required to meet the public hearing requirement of (D) above. Setbacks for said replacement mobile home dwelling or accessory use shall follow the requirements established within the "T-2" Mobile Home Park zoning district. However, sheds with a dimension of less than ten (10) feet by ten (10) feet may be established on the property line pursuant to Section 18-1530.2, "Accessory Buildings Not Permitted In Required Setbacks or Yards." 
(K)  NONCONFORMING NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS. In any zoning district, where a dwelling is nonconforming only as to the number of dwelling units it contains, said building may be altered or enlarged, provided the number of dwelling units are not increased, subject to the provisions of (E) above. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1504.3. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS. 
(A)  VESTED RIGHTS. Any building for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this Article, or of amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within one hundred eighty-two (182) days of the date of issue of the building permit and remains valid. Necessary changes during the construction period of the permit will be permitted; such changes need not conform to the newly adopted Article or amendments thereto but must meet the regulations that were in force at the time of issuance of the building permit. Such building shall thereafter be deemed a lawfully established building. This Subsection is not intended to extend the effective time of any building permit granted pursuant to this Article, or any ordinance, rule, or regulation of the City. 
(B)  REPAIR-ALTERATIONS. Normal maintenance of a nonconforming building is permitted, including necessary structural repairs and interior or exterior alterations which do not increase the nonconformity of the building. 
(C)  DAMAGE-DESTRUCTION. If a nonconforming building is damaged or destroyed by any means, such damaged building may be rebuilt. The building may be restored to its original configuration. However, said building must meet current Code requirements for building and fire, as well as the requirements of Article 8 Flood Damage Control, Land Development Code. In any event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure must have begun construction within a period of twelve (12) months from the date of damage or destruction and diligently pursued to completion, provided that in the event of a natural disaster, the City Manager may extend this timeframe for all buildings within the City as needed to accommodate recovery on a large-scale. 
(D)  DISTANCE FROM RESIDENTIAL USES. In any commercial or industrial district, where a building is located closer to a residential or mixed use zoning district than permitted in the regulations for the district, such building may be increased in size, but not in the direction of the subject residential or mixed use district. 
(E)  NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY STRUCTURES. Accessory structures, limited to equipment such as air-conditioners, heat pumps, pool pumps, and fuel oil or propane gas tanks, nonconforming as to required setbacks, may be replaced with like equipment in the same location at the existing nonconforming setback. 
(F)  NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOME STRUCTURES. Mobile home structures, including accessory carports and/or screen rooms, nonconforming as to required setback, may be replaced with another like structure in the same location at the existing nonconforming setback. 
(G)  EXPANSION. A nonconforming building may be increased in size, but not in such a manner as to increase the dimensional nonconformity, except as hereinafter provided: 
1.  Floor Area Ratio: See Section 18-1503.10 "Transfer of Development Rights" for lots located within the Community Redevelopment District (CRD) Land Use Plan Map category. 
2.  Any additions directly connected and being made a part of a nonconforming building existing as of August 14, 1997, may be constructed in a manner that will maintain the yard setback requirements in effect at the time such building was originally constructed and as evident at the time of application for such addition, except that no such additions shall encroach upon the "visibility triangle" as defined by Sec. 18-1502.2, "Definitions." 
3.  Lot Coverage: When lot coverage is nonconforming, the lot coverage of any building or improvement shall not be increased unless there is a proportionate reduction on another portion of the site. Should the principal building be removed from the site, the site shall be made to conform with the maximum lot coverage allowance. See also Sec. 18-1530.18 "Master Stormwater Retention/Detention Ponds, Crediting Against Maximum Lot Coverage (Industrial Zoning Districts)" and Section 18-1503.1 "Transfer of Development Rights" for sites located within the Community Redevelopment District (CRD) Land Use Plan Map category. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1504.4. - NONCONFORMING LOTS. 
(A)  SINGLE LOT. Any single lot which fails to meet the applicable district requirements for area, width, depth or other dimension, and where said lot was of record prior to the date of adoption of the current size and dimensional requirements for the subject district, (see the "Dimensional Regulations" section of the applicable zoning districts for applicable dates), and complied with all subdivision, platting and zoning regulations at the time of recordation, such lot shall be deemed nonconforming, and may be used for permitted use in the subject districts subject to applicable regulations of the district other than said lot area and dimensional requirements. 
Any lot not in compliance with the minimum lot area and dimensional regulations at the time of its establishment on record, and any lot not in compliance with the platting or subdivision regulations at the time of its establishment on record shall be deemed an illegally created and substandard lot that cannot be developed unless combined with other lots to create one (1) conforming lot. 
A nonconforming lot shall not be reduced in size or dimension such that the extent of any nonconformity is increased, or any new nonconformity is created. 
(B)  MULTIPLE LOTS IN THE "R-1", "R-2", AND "R-3" DISTRICTS. 
1.  Combination of Lots. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the "R-1", "R-2", and "R-3" Districts, any of two (2) or more undeveloped nonconforming lots of record with continuous frontage on a street, under common ownership as of the date the lots became nonconforming, shall be considered as a single lot that shall not be utilized, developed, or transferred, by sale or otherwise, except as a single lot, except as provided below. As used in this Section, the term "undeveloped lot" shall mean any lot which is not improved with a permanent principal building suitable for human habitation or other intended use and shall include developed lots from which such permanent principal building is hereafter removed for any reason, including damage or destruction and not replaced in accordance with this Division. 
Any such lots may be replatted, or undergo lot line adjustment pursuant to Section 18-101.5 of the Land Development Code into lots which meet or exceed all of the current minimum applicable dimensional regulations of that zoning district. The lot line adjustment procedure shall not be utilized if any new or additional right-of-way or access easement is created or if any extension of a City utility system is required. 
2.  Appeal Procedures. In any case where the strict application of Subparagraph 1, above, would result in an undue hardship, City Council may waive said provisions, in whole or in part, provided that such waiver is not contrary to the public interest. The intent of the waiver process is to allow for consideration of the prevailing development pattern and potential of an area, including the extent of applicability of Subsection (B) to other properties in the area in order to determine whether requiring the combination of nonconforming lots serves a public purpose. The public purpose determination also includes consideration of the adequacy of infrastructure to serve the additional development that would be authorized by a waiver, and the economic impact to the City of granting the waiver. In determining whether such provisions should be wholly or partially waived, City Council shall consider the following criteria 
(a)  Character, existing aesthetic conditions, zoning, lot size, lot configuration, and use of the property in question and of other property in the vicinity. The existence of unimproved nonconforming lots in the vicinity shall not constitute grounds for the approval of a waiver. 
(b)  Natural features of the property in question and of other property in the vicinity. 
(c)  Adequacy of off-site infrastructure improvements. 
(d)  Traffic impacts. 
(e)  Economic impact to the City. 
(f)  Ability to provide municipal services, including emergency services to the property in question and to other property in the vicinity. 
(g)  Whether the hardship resulted in whole or in part from the actions of the applicant. 
Further, before a waiver may be granted, City Council shall make a finding that based upon the foregoing factors, an undue hardship would result, and that the waiver is the minimum waiver that will alleviate such undue hardship. In addition, City Council must make a finding that the granting of the waiver will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
In granting any waiver, the City Council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards as conditions thereof. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which waiver is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Article and punishable as provided therein. 
No petition for a waiver may be considered by the City Council until public notice has been given of a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be as required by Section 18-1534, "Public Notice Requirements." 
All applications for waivers to the provisions of this Section shall adhere to the administrative procedures as may be established from time to time by the City Manager.

SECTION 18-1520. - "B-1" GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 18-1520.1. - Statement Of Intent. 
    The "B-1" General Commercial District is established in order to identify and provide those geographic areas within the City of Pinellas Park that are appropriate for the development and maintenance of a general commercial environment with supportive medium density residential. This district is intended for a wide variety of consumer-oriented commercial uses and activities located in proximity to major thoroughfares and to residential concentrations, together with accessory uses and public facilities customary to or required for such an environment. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010; Ord. No. 3840, § 1, 5-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-1520.2. - DENSITY REGULATIONS. 
    Areas of the City for which this zoning district is appropriate are designated on the Land Use Plan Map as either Residential Medium (RM), Residential/Office/Retail (R/O/R), Residential/Office General (R/OG), Commercial General (CG), Commercial Recreation (CR), Resort Facilities High (RFH) or Community Redevelopment District (CRD). Parcels of land in the "B-1" General Commercial District that are classified RM Residential Medium Future Land Use shall only be developed with multi-family residential use. Single-family detached dwellings are permitted in the "B-1" District when assigned a Future Land Use Map classification of R/OG, R/O/R or CRD. Multi-family dwellings are permitted at a maximum density of fifteen (15.0) units per net acre when assigned a Future Land Use Map classification of RM (multi-family dwellings only), R/OG, CG or CRD. Multi-family dwellings are permitted at a maximum density of 18 units per net acre when assigned a Future Land Use Map classification of R/O/R. As an incentive to develop mixed use developments or affordable housing on parcels assigned a Future Land Use Map classification of CG or CRD, City Council may, in its sole discretion and if it determines that additional density will help promote mixed use developments or affordable housing on such parcels, approve up to twenty-four (24) dwelling units per net acre subject to the following location criteria and development approval requirements. 
1.  Approval by City Council of a "PUD" overlay. (see Section 18-1529). 
2.  The parcel must be located with frontage on an arterial street as defined in the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
3.  The developer shall coordinate site development with the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA) for the provision of transit supportive infrastructure such as, but not limited to, transit shelters, bike racks or bus pull off bays. Residential parking requirements may be reduced to one (1) off-street parking space per unit when transit supportive infrastructure is provided to the extent that City Council determines is appropriate given the subject's location relative to locations with high employment opportunity or job/career training facilities. 
4.  Mixed use development rights for parcels assigned CG future land use shall be determined by applying a F.A.R. of .45 for nonresidential uses and a lot size of one thousand eight hundred fifteen (1,815) square feet of land area per dwelling unit, exclusive of the land area assigned to the nonresidential development. Parcels assigned the CRD future land use are not subject to the above land area apportionment formula when being developed with mixed uses consistently with the Community Redevelopment Plan. 
5.  Developers that choose the higher density option shall provide affordable housing equal to fifty (50) percent of the units above the base density as follows: Proposed density = 24 units per acre minus fifteen (15) units per acre base density = 9 units per acre density bonus x .5 =4.5 or 4 units per acre to be provided as affordable units. 
6.  Affordable housing means the same as that provided by the Pinellas County Housing Authority, as the same may change from time to time, for low income categories and workforce housing. 
    For lots located within the Residential Medium (RM), Residential/Office General (R/OG), Residential/Office/Retail (R/O/R), Commercial Recreation (CR) and Resort Facilities High (RFH) Land Use Plan Map categories, public/semi-public (institutional) uses (except Public Educational Facilities) shall not exceed a maximum area of five (5) gross acres. Ancillary nonresidential or Transportation/Utility uses shall not exceed three (3) acres. For lots located in the Commercial General (CG) Land Use Map category, public/semi-public or Transportation/Utility uses shall not exceed a maximum of five (5) acres. Any such use, alone or when added to existing abutting or functionally abutting like uses which exceeds the thresholds stated above shall require a Land Use Plan Map amendment to Institutional (I), Transportation/Utility (T/U) or other Land Use Map category (as appropriate), which shall include such use and all abutting or functionally abutting like uses.

SECTION 18-1521. - "MXD" MIXED USE DISTRICT 

Sec. 18-1521.1. - STATEMENT OF INTENT. 
    The "MXD" Mixed Use District is established in order to guide and encourage the development of a mixture of residential, office, and commercial land uses along the Park Boulevard corridor and periphery, characterized by a variety of housing types, office and commercial development, including vertical mixed-use and the integrated mixing of uses horizontally within single developments. The "MXD" District implements the adopted Community Redevelopment Plan, which encourages mixed-use development at moderate intensity in order that the various uses compliment and support one another, share parking infrastructure, reduce traffic congestion through internal trip capture, and as a whole, become a center of pedestrian activity that beckons additional private investment in the corridor, and further supports the Town Center. This Section is further intended: to attract a diversity of uses with an emphasis on street activities such as outdoor cafes and evening activities such as entertainment and civic functions; to encourage development of public open space which in turn encourages a pedestrian environment, thereby enhancing the overall character of the Downtown Community Redevelopment Area; and to encourage use of the local and regional bus system as an alternative to private passenger vehicles. 
    Allowable uses are based upon the Community Redevelopment Plan. The intent of this District is to encourage the development of mixed uses in one unified project. 
    Light repair, assembly and manufacturing activity on a scale associated with artisans and crafters is permitted in combination with retail and/or residential uses provided that the area devoted to these activities shall not occur in the front one-fourth of the structure and the activities do not result in impacts related to prohibitions outlined in Section 18-1524.5(E) of this Code. Furthermore, no outdoor storage shall be permitted with this activity. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1521.2. - DENSITY REGULATIONS. 
    Areas of the City for which this zoning district is appropriate are designated on the Land Use Plan Map as Community Redevelopment District (CRD). A maximum density of fifteen (15) dwelling units per net acre shall be permitted; however, a maximum of twenty-five (25) dwelling units per net acre is permissible through bonuses. The maximum intensity for nonresidential development is a FAR of forty-five hundredths (0.45); however, a maximum FAR of one (1.0) is permissible through bonuses. It is intended that development standards and performance standards bonuses control the permissible density or intensity, design and development criteria. 
    For calculating allowable density and intensity of development, the maximum allowable FAR shall be applied to the total net acreage to determine nonresidential development yield exclusive of allowable residential development potential. The Community Redevelopment Agency is not obligated to approve site plans based on total potential yield if the site plan is not compatible with abutting development. The following example illustrates this calculation: 
Site = 1 acre = 43,560 square feet 
.45 F.A.R. × 43,560 SF = 19,602 square feet of nonresidential development, plus 15 du/ac × 1 acre = 15 dwelling units 
    Thus a mixed use development on a one (1) net acre site may develop nineteen thousand six hundred two (19,602) square feet of retail, office or personal services or combinations of such along with fifteen (15) dwelling units on a one (1) net acre site (exclusive of bonus potential). 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010)

SECTION 18-1522. - "TC" TOWN CENTER DISTRICT 

Sec. 18-1522.1. - STATEMENT OF INTENT. 
    The "TC" Town Center District is established in order to encourage a mix of residential, commercial, institutional, office and professional uses, located adjacent to major transportation facilities. The development standards are intended to promote developments of an urban scale, and high quality urban design, including significant public space areas. Allowable uses are based upon the Community Redevelopment Plan. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1522.2. - DENSITY REGULATIONS. 
    Areas of the City for which this zoning category is appropriate are designated on the Land Use Plan Map as Community Redevelopment District (CRD). A maximum density of fifteen (15) dwelling units per net gross shall be permitted; however, a maximum of twenty-five (25) dwelling units per net acre is permissible through bonuses. The maximum intensity for nonresidential development is a FAR of seventy-five hundredths (0.75), increasable to a maximum FAR of two and seventy-five hundredths (2.75) through bonuses. It is intended that development standards and performance standards bonuses control the permissible density or intensity, design, and development criteria. 
    For calculating allowable density and intensity of development, the maximum allowable FAR shall be applied to the total net acreage to determine nonresidential development yield exclusive of allowable residential development potential. The Community Redevelopment Agency is not obligated to approve site plans based on total potential yield if the site plan is not compatible with abutting development. The following example illustrates this calculation: 
Site = 1 acre = 43,560 square feet 
.45 F.A.R. × 43,560 SF = 19,602 square feet of nonresidential development yield, plus 15 du/ac × 1 acre = 15 dwelling units yield (exclusive of bonus potential.). 
    Thus a mixed use development on a one (1) net acre site may develop nineteen thousand, six hundred two (19,602) square feet of retail, office or personal services or combinations of such along with fifteen (15) dwelling units on a one (1) acre site. 
    Light repair, assembly and manufacturing activity on a scale associated with artisans and crafters is permitted in combination with retail and/or residential uses provided that the area devoted to these activities shall not occur in the front one-fourth of the structure and the activities do not result in impacts related to prohibitions outlined in Section 18-1524.5(E) of this Code. Furthermore, no outdoor storage shall be permitted with this activity.

Section 18-1523. - "CH" HEAVY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 18-1523.1. - STATEMENT OF INTENT. 
    The "CH" Heavy Commercial District is established in order to identify and provide those geographic areas within the City of Pinellas Park that are appropriate for the development and maintenance of a heavy commercial/light manufacturing and warehousing environment. This district is intended primarily for compatible retail, wholesale, distribution and light manufacturing operations, none of which require large areas for outdoor storage or display, and that do not involve the use of materials, processes, or machinery likely to cause undesirable effects upon neighboring properties, together with accessory uses and public facilities, customary to or required for such an environment. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1523.2. - DENSITY REGULATIONS. 
    Areas of the City for which this zoning category is appropriate are indicated on the Land Use Plan Map as either Commercial General (CG), Industrial Limited (IL), or Community Redevelopment District (CRD). No residential development is permitted in the "CH" Heavy Commercial District.

SECTION 18-1524. - "M-1" LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 18-1524.1. - STATEMENT OF INTENT. 
    The "M-1" Light Industrial District is established in order to identify and provide those geographic areas within the City of Pinellas Park that are appropriate for the development and maintenance of a light industrial environment, which does not create hazardous or other serious detrimental effects upon the public health in the surrounding areas. This district is intended primarily for a wide variety of industrial uses and compatible retail, wholesale, distributing operations, and in limited situations as provided in (B) below, single and multi-family dwellings, together with accessory uses and public facilities customary to or required for such an environment. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1524.2. - DENSITY/INTENSITY REGULATIONS. 
    Areas of the City for which this zoning category is appropriate are designated on the Land Use Plan Map as Industrial Limited (IL) or Community Redevelopment District (CRD) Future Land Use Categories. 
(A)  For lots located within the Industrial Limited (IL) Land Use Plan Map category, public/semi-public, commercial recreation, retail commercial, personal/business services, commercial/business services, and temporary lodging uses shall not exceed maximum area of five (5) gross acres. Any such use, alone or when added to existing abutting or functionally abutting like uses in the same category, shall require a Land Use Plan Map amendment which shall include such use and all contiguous like uses. Secondary residential uses are only permitted pursuant to the requirements set forth in (C) below. 
(B)  A planned industrial/mixed use project that exceeds fifty (50) gross acres in area may include secondary public/semi-public, retail commercial, personal/business service, commercial recreation, and Temporary Lodging uses subject to the following: 
1.  Secondary nonresidential uses, alone or in combination, shall not comprise more than twenty five (25) percent of the area of the project which shall be governed by a MUPUD master development plan. (see Sec. 18-1529.11) Where the property included in the master development plan is adjacent to or within five hundred (500) feet of another municipal or unincorporated county jurisdiction, the master development plan shall be submitted to that adjoining jurisdiction for review and comment. 
2.  The secondary non-industrial uses shall be integral to, oriented within, and function as part of, the mixed use project as distinct from freestanding unrelated out-parcel type uses. 
(C)  An industrial/mixed use project which comprises not less than one hundred (100) gross acres under common control through a DRI development order or MUPUD master conceptual plan may include secondary residential uses subject to the following: 
1.  Such residential component shall not: 
(a)  Comprise more than twenty-five (25) percent of the area of the DRI or MUPUD master conceptual plan within the jurisdiction of the City of Pinellas Park. 
(b)  Be located within the Coastal High Hazard Area. 
(c)  Be located within the sixty-five (65) decibel Day-Night Sound Level area as identified on the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport Noise Contours map, April 1996 by Greiner, Inc. and as adopted by Pinellas County in Ordinance Number 97-58. 
(d)  Be permitted to transfer density to other Land Use Plan Map categories outside of the approved master development plan area. 
(e)  Be permitted to use density averaging outside the master development plan area. 
2.  The secondary residential use that is part of a planned industrial/mixed use project shall be subject to a MUPUD master development plan and DRI development order providing unified control of the entire project. 
3.  The master development plan required for industrial/ mixed use projects that includes residential use shall, upon Planning and Zoning Commission review and preliminary approval by City Council, be submitted to the Pinellas Planning Council (PPC) for review and recommendation to the County-wide Planning Authority (CPA). The CPA may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the master development plan; which action shall require a majority plus one vote of the entire CPA if such action is contrary to the PPC recommendation. City Council shall not approve a final site plan or issue a development order other than as is consistent with the action of the CPA. 
4.  Where the property included in the master development plan is adjacent to or within five hundred (500) feet of an adjacent municipal or county jurisdiction, the master development plan shall be submitted to that adjoining jurisdiction at the same time that it is submitted to the PPC/CPA for review and comment by that adjoining jurisdiction. 
5.  The master development plan shall include sufficient information to demonstrate that the secondary use components are integrated with the other uses in the project. The master development plan shall also include sufficient information to demonstrate to the PPC and CPA the relationships between, and compatibility of the industrial, secondary non-industrial and residential uses within and adjacent to the project. Criteria used to determine an acceptable, integrated industrial/mixed use project that includes residential use shall include: 
(a)  An appropriate justification for the residential component, including consideration of the following: 
(1)  Functional relationship between the residential component and anticipated demand for housing created by the remainder of the development proposal; 
(2)  Phasing or sequencing of the project to coordinate residential construction with the anticipated demand for and timing of the nonresidential portion of the project; 
(3)  Contributory nature of the employment created and the percentage of the wages paid over and above the average Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) wage; 
(4)  Adequacy of infrastructure in relationship to the phasing and scale of the project. 
(b)  An appropriate buffer in and between the residential component of the master planned industrial/mixed use project and adjoining plan categories or uses in those categories. This buffer requirement will consider the following: 
(1)  The nature and characteristics of the adjoining nonresidential use(s), including noise, air, odor, and visual operating characteristics. 
(2)  The distance from and elevation of the adjoining nonresidential use, including the intervening land form, building or structural opaque barrier, and type and dimensions of landscape buffer. 
(3)  Any county ordinance that regulates the setback of residential uses from a county-owned solid waste disposal facility. 
(c)  Development of the project shall proceed in a manner that is substantially consistent with the CPA approved master development plan. Any amendment required to maintain that consistency shall all be reviewed by the PPC and approved by the CPA.

However, in reviewing the proposed Master Plan, City Council shall consider the following criteria: Character of the immediately surrounding development; size of the parcel, configuration and natural features of the land to be developed, traffic impacts, configuration and natural features of the land to be developed, and nature of the proposed development. 
(b)  Height. Flexibility in building height will be allowed provided that the proposed height is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Increased setbacks and buffering to compensate for added building height may be considered to reduce the impact on abutting properties. 
(E)  OUTDOOR STORAGE. Outdoor storage facilities are prohibited in a CPUD. This provision shall not be construed to exclude the outdoor display and sale of new or used automotive vehicles for sale or rent, or the incidental display of goods or chattels for sale or rent by an establishment having activities that occur principally within a building. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1529.10. - INDUSTRIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (IPUD). 
(A)  LOCATION. The Industrial PUD (IPUD) overlay shall only be assigned to those areas zoned either "M-1" or "IH" on the official Zoning Map. 
(B)  USES. 
1.  "Permitted" and "Conditional Uses" within an IPUD shall be limited to those uses allowed in the "M-1" Light Industrial and/or the "IH" Heavy Industrial District as underlying thereon. Conditional uses shall adhere to the applicable provisions of Section 18-1534 of this Article except public hearing requirements of the PUD District shall apply. If a mix of residential and commercial uses are anticipated then the developer shall apply for the MUPUD overlay assignment. 
2.  Dependent upon the location of the IPUD and its relationship to abutting or functionally abutting residentially zoned property, a further limitation on the specific uses permitted within the IPUD may be required. Such limitations shall be adopted as part of the assignment of the IPUD overlay. 
(C)  DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS. 
1.  Lot Area, Lot Depth and Width, Setback Regulations, Height Requirements. See underlying Zoning District for dimensional regulations. 
2.  Should the established regulations be inappropriate for non-traditional lot layout or site design, the following guidelines are established. 
(a)  No minimum lot size or structural setbacks except as may be required by City Council to establish compatibility between proposed and existing abutting or functionally abutting land uses. However, any industrial IPUD site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without undue hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract from the probability of flooding, wind and water erosion, subsidence, or slipping of the soil. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall all be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. The site shall also contain sufficient width and depth to adequately accommodate its proposed use and design. 
(b)  Structural setbacks. In determining flexible setbacks, a variety of criteria will be considered, including, but not limited to, the character of the surrounding area, size, configuration and natural features of the land to be developed, and the nature of the proposed development. However, when abutting or functionally abutting any residentially zoned property, a minimum building setback of thirty (30) feet shall be maintained. 
(c)  Height. Flexibility in building height will be allowed provided that the proposed height is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Increased setbacks and buffering to compensate for added building height may be considered to reduce the impact on abutting properties. 
(D)  RIGHT-OF-WAY REQUIREMENTS. 
1.  All IPUDs having interior public streets shall dedicate eighty (80) feet wide rights-of-way and construct a minimum of forty (40) feet wide pavements. All corners are to have forty (40) feet radius and cul-de-sacs are to have seventy-two (72) feet diameter of paving. 
2.  Ingress and egress to industrial IPUDs shall not be through a residential district. 
(E)  LOADING DOCKS. 
1.  No loading docks shall be permitted to be located along the front facade of any building which faces a street. 
2.  No loading docks shall be permitted along any side which abuts or functionally abuts residentially zoned property. 
3.  Loading docks shall be located a minimum of sixty (60) feet from any adjacent right-of-way or a distance required such that delivery and transport vehicles are not required to block at any time adjacent rights of way, driveways or parking spaces. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1529.11. - MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. 
(A)  LOCATION. The Mixed Use Planned Unit Development (MUPUD) overlay shall be appropriate in all Mixed Use, Commercial, and Industrial future land use designations where more than one development type is planned. 
(B)  USES. 
1.  "Permitted and Conditional Uses" within a MUPUD shall be limited to those uses allowed by the underlying zoning district of the subject property. Conditional uses shall adhere to the applicable provisions of Section 18-1531 of this Article except public hearing requirements that are supplanted by this PUD Article. 
2.  Dependent upon the location of the MUPUD and its relationship to abutting or functionally abutting residentially zoned property, a further limitation on the specific uses permitted within the MUPUD may be required. Such limitations shall be adopted as part of the assignment of the MUPUD overlay. 
(C)  DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS. 
1.  Lot Area, Lot Depth and Width, Setback Regulations, Height Requirements. See underlying Zoning district for dimensional regulations. 
2.  Should the established dimensional regulations be inappropriate for non-traditional lot layout or site design, the following guidelines are established. 
(a)  No minimum lot size. However, any MUPUD site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without undue hazards to persons or property on or off the tract from the probability of flooding, wind and water erosion, subsidence, or slipping of the soil. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall all be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. The site shall also contain sufficient width and depth to adequately accommodate its proposed use and design. 
(b)  Structural setbacks. In determining flexible setbacks, a variety of criteria will be considered, including, but not limited to, the character of the surrounding area, size, configuration and natural features of the land to be developed, and the nature of the proposed development. Where a proposed MUPUD boundary abuts or functionally abuts a single-family zoning district or single-family development, regardless of zoning district designation, City Council shall require adequate setbacks, buffers and screens to the extent necessary to establish compatibility with the single-family development. Due to the wide range of potential land uses in the MUPUD District, setbacks, buffers and screens shall be proportionate to the proposed use therein. Buffer landscaping standards, Section 18-1533, Table 1 shall serve as a guide to establish compatibility, however, City Council may exceed these recommended standards to the extent necessary based upon the degree of potential incompatibility between abutting or functionally abutting land uses both within and outside of MUPUD boundaries. Where a proposed MUPUD is separated from an adjacent existing land use by a one hundred (100) feet wide right-of-way or easement such adjacent land shall not be considered to functionally abut. 
(c)  Height. Flexibility in building height will be allowed provided that the proposed height is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Increased setbacks and buffering to compensate for added building height may be considered to reduce the impact on abutting properties. 
(d)  Master Plan Review-Alternative Review Procedure. Projects that do not require Development of Regional Impact Review (F.S. ch. 380.06) shall have approved by City Council a Master Plan consistent with the requirements of Section 18-1540.3 for each phase being considered for specific approval by City Council. Remaining phases can be conceptually approved by review of a Conceptual Master Plan as discussed below. Projects that do require a Development of Regional Impact (DRI) development order or prospective sites of twenty-five (25) acres or more may elect the following Conceptual Master Plan Approval Process. 
(e)  For projects described in Subsection (d) above a Conceptual Master Development Plan may be approved by City Council, however, for each increment of development proposed a Master Plan consistent with Section 18-1540.3 shall be approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Preliminary Site Plans for parcels that do not abut or functionally abut a residential district may be approved by the City Manager upon the recommendation of the Community Development Administrator if said plans are consistent with the Conceptual Master Plan approved by City Council at a public hearing. Development increments that do abut or functionally abut a residential district must be approved by City Council but without the necessity of a public hearing. At a minimum, the Conceptual Master Development Plan shall include the following and shall not be considered complete unless all are submitted and approved together: 
(1)  General information as enumerated in Section 18-1529.3(D). 
(2)  Proposed densities and intensities of development for each increment expressed as dwelling units per acre, type of dwelling unit (single-family detached, single-family attached, multi-family) for residential development and floor area ratio, building height and total gross square footage of nonresidential development. 
(3)  Existing conditions as enumerated in Section 18-1529.3(D)2. 
(4)  Master Right-of-Way Plan including typical sections for each street type proposed, internal vehicle and pedestrian circulation and provisions for mass transit. 
(5)  Master Buffer Plan including typical sections for each buffer, i.e. perimeter, streetscape. 
(6)  Master Drainage Plan. 
(7)  Master Utilities Plan. 
(8)  Master Signage Plan. 
(9)  Geographic and Chronologic Phasing Plan. Where streets and utilities are existing at the time of Conceptual Master Plan consideration a geographic phasing plan shall not be required. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1529.12. - CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS. 
(A)  The City Manager may approve minor changes in the location, size or height of structures, single-family detached residential setbacks, signage and other improvements authorized by the adopted Master Plan provided that the intent of the plan is not changed and provided the proposed change is not in conflict with paragraphs (B) and (C) below. 
(B)  The following changes may be approved by City Council as an amendment to the plan without a public hearing or public notification:

6.  Significantly change the location or amounts of land devoted to specified land uses on the adopted Master Plan. 
7.  Change the intent of the Master Plan as adopted by City Council. 
8.  Change any boundary of the planned unit development. 
9.  Transfer and/or amend the densities among the undeveloped phases of the PUD. 
(D)  PUD INSPECTIONS TO ASSURE CONFORMANCE. If the site is found to be in violation of the Master Plan, the City shall have the authority to withhold building permits and/or certificates of occupancy until the site is brought into conformance with the adopted Master Plan. 
(E)  VARIANCES. 
1.  In any case where the strict application of the requirements of this Article present an undue hardship, City Council may waive in whole or in part, one (1) or more of the requirements imposed under said Article. In no case shall any required landscaped area or strip be eliminated in its entirety. 
2.  In determining whether such requirements shall be wholly or partially waived, City Council shall consider the following criteria: Character of the immediately surrounding development; size of parcel; configuration and natural features of the land to be developed; adequacy of off-site improvements; traffic impacts; and nature of the proposed development. 
3.  All variances approved by City Council shall be delineated on the Master Plan.

Sec. 18-1530.1. - ACCESSORY USE REGULATIONS. 
    The following regulations shall apply to all accessory uses and buildings incidental to any permitted or conditional use. Pursuant to Section 18-1502.1, "Interpretation of Words," the term "building" includes the term "structure" unless otherwise specified. 
(A)  ZONING OF ACCESSORY BUILDINGS. In the event that a development project crosses zoning district boundaries, no accessory use shall be located within a different zoning district than the principal use to which it is accessory, unless said other zoning district also permits the same principal use. 
(B)  TIMING OF CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY. 
1.  No accessory building shall be constructed upon a lot until construction of the principal building has commenced. 
2.  No accessory building shall be occupied until the principal building is legally occupied. 
3.  No accessory use shall be established until the principal use is legally established and operating. 
(C)  LOCATION OF ACCESSORY USES AND BUILDINGS. Accessory uses, to include accessory buildings for the purpose of this subparagraph, shall be located on the same lot as the principal use and/or building to which it is accessory. If an accessory use is located upon a different lot of record than the principal use, the Zoning Director may require recordation of a Unity of Title covenant if the Director determines that such a covenant is necessary to prevent the sale, lease, rental, or use of the accessory use independent from the principal use. 
(D)  ATTACHED ACCESSORY BUILDINGS. When an accessory building or roofed structure is attached to the principal building by a breezeway, passageway or similar means, it shall comply with the setback requirements of the principal building to which it is attached. 
(E)  LIMITATION ON USE. Nonresidential accessory buildings shall be used by only the employees, patrons, owners, lessees, or tenants of the premises. 
(F)  ACCESSORY BUILDINGS NOT TO BE RENTED OR INHABITED. Residential accessory buildings such as garages, greenhouses, guest houses, and workshops shall not be rented. No such building shall be inhabited, except as provided for guest houses in Section 18-1502.2. 
(G)  ACCESSORY TENTS, AWNINGS, AND CABANAS. Accessory tents, awnings, and cabanas, including all canvas and similar coverings, painted surfaces, and their support or anchoring systems, must be well maintained in good repair consistent with the manufacturer's product design specifications at all times. 
(H)  Accessory structures shall be clearly subordinate to the principal structure on a lot. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1530.2. - ACCESSORY BUILDINGS NOT PERMITTED IN REQUIRED YARDS.

1.  Utility/storage sheds shall be no larger than ten (10) feet by ten (10) feet, and shall be no more than ten (10) feet in height. (Note: When making the determination regarding size of the unit, only the dimensions of the accessory structure are to be considered, not the square footage of the overall unit.) 
2.  No more than two (2) utility/storage sheds shall be permitted on any residential lot. 
3.  For the purposes of this Section, two (2) utility/storage sheds shall be considered one (1) utility/storage shed if the two (2) utility/storage sheds are placed abutting each other and the combined dimensions do not exceed the dimensions set forth in Subsection 1 above. 
4.  The utility/storage shed(s) shall not be located upon any easement, unless the applicant can establish, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and all potentially impacted, public and private utility agencies, that the placement thereof within such easement will not interfere with the utilization and maintenance of the easement. 
5.  Utility/storage sheds that exceed the dimensions set forth in Subsection 1 above may be placed in the rear yard provided that the pertinent Zoning District required setbacks for structures are maintained. 
6.  Wherever an eligible utility/storage shed is placed upon a concrete or other type slab of impervious material within a required side or rear yard, a setback of five (5) feet is required. The required five (5) feet setback shall be measured from the edge of the slab nearest the property line. 
(C)  Within the "ROR", "GO", "B-1" and "MXD" Zoning Districts, utility/storage sheds are permitted subject to the same regulations outlined in Section (B) above, provided the principal use of the property is residential in nature. Should the use be nonresidential in nature, then required zoning district setbacks shall be maintained. 
(D)  In addition, the utility/storage shed shall maintain a separation distance of ten (10) feet away from the principal dwelling. A relaxation of the separation requirement may be applied upon written authorization of the Fire Department attesting to its compliance with Fire Code and a finding that the desired separation distance is a minimum safe distance given the types of material or substances that will be stored therein.

(E)  EXCEPTIONS. In the event that all of the location or height restrictions in this Section prevent the user of a dish antenna from obtaining proper reception, the City Manager or his designee shall approve the minimum deviation from such restrictions that is determined necessary to allow line-of-sight contact with the satellite or transmitter for reasonable reception, and which does not impose an unreasonable expense or delay, provided that the antenna will be placed upon premises under the control or exclusive use of the user. No fee is required for such determination and approval. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1530.8. - COMMUNICATION TOWER. 
(A)  PURPOSE AND INTENT. The regulations and requirements of this Section are intended to: 
1.  Promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens by regulating the location of communications towers within the City. 
2.  Provide for the appropriate location and development of communications towers within the City; 
3.  Minimize adverse visual effects of communications towers through careful design, siting, landscaping screening, flush mounted antennas mounted within six (6) horizontal inches of the tower, and innovative camouflaging techniques 
4.  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; and 
5.  Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of communication towers by maximizing use of any new or existing communications towers or structures through shared use or co-location, i.e., combining to reduce the number of towers needed. 
(B)  NEW COMMUNICATION TOWER. Applicants proposing to locate a new communication tower shall comply with the following: 
1.  All applicants for new towers shall investigate the possibility of co-locating or sharing use of available space on existing towers or structures prior to requesting conditional use approval for a new tower. The availability of co-location facilities or shared space, as demonstrated by the applicant, will be considered by the City in the evaluation of any application. The applicant is to provide, at minimum, the following information to demonstrate if an existing structure or tower can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna: 
(a)  Whether there are existing towers or structures located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's coverage requirements. 
(b)  Whether there are existing towers or structures that have sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.

The purpose of allowing outdoor display and sales is to allow a business additional merchandise exposure to passersby, to allow for the sale of special stock or temporary overstock, and to enhance pedestrian activity in front of businesses. Outdoor display and sales is subject to the following conditions in order to limit outdoor sales and display to a function and scale that are accessory and complimentary in nature to indoor display and sales, and to ensure that outdoor display and sales does not interfere with normal site functions, and does not aesthetically detract from the neat and orderly appearance of the City's business districts. This Section shall not apply to outdoor display in conjunction with the sales or rental of new and used cars, motorcycles, trucks, utility trailers, recreational vehicles or mobile homes where permitted by this Article, nor outdoor display in conjunction with the sales of pools, and landscape materials at retail plant nurseries or garden centers accessory to enclosed retail businesses. 
(A)  The outdoor display and sale of goods and merchandise for retail businesses displaying merchandise that is for sale also within the building shall be conducted on the same lot as the retail business and proximate to the building. The outdoor display and sales area shall not exceed an area equivalent to fifteen (15) percent of the gross floor area of the business. A waiver to this square footage limitation shall, upon written request from an authorized representative of the business, be considered by City Council for locations outside of the City's Redevelopment Area or by the Community Redevelopment Agency for locations within the City's Redevelopment Area. In determining whether or not to grant a larger outdoor display and sales area, City Council or the Community Redevelopment Agency shall consider the following criteria relative to the intent of this Section: Use of abutting properties, location of the outdoor display and sales area, configuration of the lot and the outdoor display and sales area and items to be generally displayed. In granting approval of a larger outdoor display and sales area, City Council or the Community Redevelopment Agency may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the waiver is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Article and punishable as provided by this Article. 
(B)  The applicant shall submit to the Building Development Division a detailed plot plan for review of the proposed outdoor display and sales area. The applicant shall pay a review fee as established by resolution of the City Council. The plan shall show the location and size of the outdoor display and sales area, any temporary structures which may be proposed, parking areas, existing building(s) (including location of egress doors and sidewalks to and around the building), the gross floor area of the building or unit of the retail business, drainage system, and landscaped areas. 
(C)  No portion of the outdoor display and sales area shall be on publicly owned property or rights-of-way. 
(D)  No required off-street parking space, driveway, drive aisle, loading space, streetscape or perimeter landscape buffer, or interior greenspace shall be utilized for such outdoor display and sales area, nor shall any portion encroach into the visibility triangles, as defined in Section 18-1502.2. 
(E)  No portion of the outdoor display and sales area shall block any required means of egress, nor shall it block any access route on any sidewalk.

Sec. 18-1530.17. - MINIMUM BUILDING SEPARATION. 
(A)  In order to ensure adequate light, air and privacy, and in order to prevent the perception of crowding, when a lot is developed with multifamily dwellings or multiple buildings on a lot, as determined by the City Manager, or with a mixed-use development, principal buildings shall be separated as required below, based upon building height. If adjacent principal buildings on the same lot are not the same height, the height of the tallest building shall be used to determine the minimum required building separation. This distance shall be measured at the shortest distance between any two (2) buildings. 
1.  Fifteen (15) feet of separation for buildings up to and including fifteen (15) feet in height. 
2.  Twenty (20) feet of separation for buildings greater than fifteen (15) feet in height and up to and including twenty-five (25) feet in height. 
3.  Twenty-five (25) feet of separation for buildings greater than twenty-five (25) feet in height and up to and including thirty-five (35) feet in height.

Sec. 18-1530.18. - MASTER STORMWATER RETENTION/DETENTION PONDS, CREDITING AGAINST MAXIMUM LOT COVERAGE (INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS). 
    In order to encourage master stormwater retention/detention ponds which provide stormwater management for public streets, in areas zoned and properly utilized for industrial purposes, the maximum lot coverage of a lot in an industrial subdivision may be increased to eighty-five (85) percent, subject to the following restrictions: 
(A)  When calculating the increase in lot coverage over the maximum lot coverage of seventy-five (75) percent, the total amount of existing impervious surfaces of the other lots within such subdivision must be considered. This aggregate total cannot exceed the maximum impervious area used in the original design of the retention/detention pond. 
(B)  When the master stormwater retention/detention pond traverses individual lots under different ownerships, the applicant requesting the increase in maximum lot coverage must enter into an agreement in a form acceptable to the City Attorney with one (1) or more of the lot owners to allow the applicant to use a percentage of the other lot owner's open space. The agreement shall be submitted to the City Zoning Division to be recorded in the Public Records of Pinellas County, Florida. 
(C)  When a master stormwater retention/detention pond is credited against maximum lot coverage, the pond shall be landscaped with canopy or intermediate trees, one (1) per seventy-five (75) feet of shoreline, based on the applicant's proportionate share of the pond. Existing approved trees will be credited to meet the intent of this Section. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1530.19. - COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL HOMES. 
(A)  Homes of six (6) or fewer residents which meet the definition of a Community Residential Home, in Section 18-1502.2, shall be deemed a single-family unit and a non-commercial, residential use. Homes of six (6) or fewer residents which meet the definition of a Community Residential Home shall be permitted uses in all zoning districts permitting single-family, duplex or multi-family uses, provided that such homes shall not be located within a radius of one thousand (1,000) feet of another existing such home with six (6) or fewer residents. The "sponsoring agency," as defined in F.S. ch. 419, as may be amended from time to time, shall notify the Zoning Division of the existence of such licensed home at the time that each home is occupied, as required by said F.S. ch. 419. 
(B)  When a site for a Community Residential Home for seven (7) to fourteen (14) residents has been selected by a sponsoring agency in an area zoned for multi-family residential uses, the sponsoring agency shall notify the City Manager in writing and include in such notice the specific address of the site, the residential licensing category, the number of residents, and the community support requirements of the program. Such notice shall also contain a statement from the applicable state licensing entity indicating the licensing status of the proposed Community Residential Home, and specifying how the home meets applicable licensing criteria for the safe care and supervision of the residents in the home, as required by F.S. ch. 419, as may be amended from time to time. The applicable state licensing entity shall also provide to the City Manager the most recently published data compiled that identifies all Community Residential Homes licensed by said agency in the City. The City Manager shall review the notification of the sponsoring agency in accordance with this Article. 
1.  Pursuant to such review, the City Manager may: 
(a)  Determine that the establishment of the Community Residential Home is in accordance with this Article and approve the location. If the location is approved, the sponsoring agency may establish the home at the site selected. 
(b)  If the City Manager fails to respond to the request within sixty (60) days, the sponsoring agency may establish the home at the site selected. 
(c)  Deny the establishment of the home. 
2.  The City Manager may deny the establishment of a Community Residential Home if the location of the home at the site selected: 
(a)  Does not otherwise conform to existing zoning regulations applicable to other multi-family uses in the area. 
(b)  Does not meet applicable licensing criteria established and determined by the state licensing agency, including requirements that the home be located to assure the safe care and supervision of all residents in the home. 
(c)  Would result in such concentration of Community Residential Homes in the area proximate to the site selected, or would result in a combination of such homes with other residences in the community, such that the nature and character of the area would be substantially altered. A home that is located within a radius of twelve hundred (1,200) feet of another existing Community Residential Home in a zoning district allowing multifamily zoning uses shall be an over concentration of such homes that substantially alters the nature and character of the area. A home that is located within five hundred (500) feet of a single-family zoning district alters the nature and character of the area. 
(C)  When a site for a Community Residential Home for more than fourteen (14) residents has been selected by a sponsoring agency in an area zoned for multi-family residential uses, such use shall require Conditional Use review and approval and shall meet the special requirements specified in Section 18-1531. 10. 
(D)  All distance requirements in this Section shall be measured from the nearest point of the existing Community Residential Home or area of single-family zoning to the nearest point of the proposed home. 
(E)  Pursuant to F.S. ch. 419, as may be amended from time to time, the state licensing agency shall not issue a license to a sponsoring agency for operating of a Community Residential Home if the sponsoring agency does not notify the City Manager of its intention to establish a program, as required by Subsection (B) above. A license issued in non-compliance with the provisions of this Section shall be considered null and void, and continued operation of the home may be enjoined. 
(F)  A dwelling unit housing a Community Residential Home of fourteen (14) or fewer residents established pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the same local laws and ordinances applicable to other non-commercial residential multi-family units in the zoning district in which it is established. 
(G)  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to affect the authority of any Community Residential Home lawfully established prior to the effective date of this section to continue to operate. 
(H)  Nothing in this Section shall permit persons to occupy a Community Residential Home who would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of other persons or whose residency would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
(I)  Adult Congregate Living Facilities, Group Homes, Family Group Homes and Foster Homes (for adults), all as defined by state law, legally approved prior to October 1, 1989, which do not meet the requirements of Community Residential Homes, shall be considered nonconforming Community Residential Homes, and shall be subject to all applicable regulations for nonconforming uses pursuant to Section 18-1504. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1530.20. - DUMPSTERS. 
    The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe standards for dumpsters for the enhancement and improvement of the visual environment. All new site development shall provide facilities for dumpsters, provided this Section shall not apply to single-family detached and duplex dwellings, except at the owner's/developer's option to provide such dumpsters, wherein the following regulations shall apply. These provisions shall also apply to sites under redevelopment. 
(A)  LOCATION. 
1.  All dumpsters shall be located on the lot that the dumpster(s) serves. 
2.  No dumpster shall be located within any public or private right-of-way, or visibility triangle, as defined in Section 18-1502.2. 
3.  All dumpsters and their enclosures shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet from any property or street line, unless a buffer of greater dimension is required elsewhere in this Code, in which case the dumpsters shall not encroach into the buffer. 
4.  All dumpsters shall be located for ease of direct pickup by the collection vehicle, as determined by the City Manager or his designee. The factors to be used in this determination shall include, but not be limited to: Abutting uses; direction of traffic flow; width of drive aisles; location of dumpsters in relation to driveway(s); size of collection vehicle; size of dumpsters; physical constraints of the site; and the existence of overhead electric or communication lines, or overhead tree limbs. 
5.  The City Manager may allow the use of dumpsters on rollers. In such case, the rolling dumpster does not have to comply with Subsection (A)4. above, but shall be located so as to have clear, unobstructed access from its enclosure to the collection vehicle. 
6.  When abutting a residential zoning district, no dumpster or trash enclosure shall be located within ten (10) feet of such abutting residential zoning district. 
(B)  STANDARDS. 
1.  All dumpsters shall be located on a concrete pad of adequate thickness and size. 
2.  All dumpsters shall be screened from view from public rights-of-way and from abutting or functionally abutting residential or mixed-use zoning districts by a six (6) feet high opaque enclosure of wood, masonry or other suitable materials. 
The use of chain link fencing with any form of shielding inserts (plastic, wood, fiberglass metal, etc.) shall not be allowed. 
The City Manager or his designee may waive this screening requirement when there is an intervening building or structure that provides an equal or greater measure of screening or when buffering requirements of this Code require a solid, six (6) feet high wall or fence along a property line. 
3.  Gates shall be required for the dumpster enclosure and shall be solid. The City Manager or his designee may waive the requirement for solid gates if, by the direction or angle of the dumpster enclosure, the dumpster will not be viewed from any public right-of-way or from any abutting or functionally abutting residential or mixed-use zoning district. Gates shall have a minimum opening width of ten (10) feet, unless a rolling dumpster has been approved in Subsection (A)5. above. 
4.  It shall be the property owner's responsibility to repair and maintain dumpster enclosures in accordance with the requirements of this Section. 
5.  Dumpsters and their enclosures shall be situated on a lot for ease of pickup by sanitation collection vehicles. 
6.  Dumpster enclosures on lots abutting a residentially zoned lot shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the residentially zoned lot line(s). 
(C)  SITES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT. 
1.  Any lot that has a dumpster(s) that does not meet the standards of this Section shall be brought into compliance with all requirements of this Section with the issuance of a building permit for any non-maintenance construction, excluding interior construction, or the issuance of an engineering permit, when the construction exceeds either of: 
(a)  Twenty (20) percent of the total square footage of the existing gross floor area and/or vehicular use area (or combination thereof); or 
(b)  Thirty (30) percent of the total square footage of the existing gross floor area and/or vehicular use area (or combination thereof), when the lot upon which the construction is proposed does not meet minimum lot requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. 
In meeting this requirement, a violation of another Code requirement cannot be created. 
(D)  ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE. 
1.  The use of individual garbage cans may be allowed by the City Manager when it can be demonstrated there is no need for a dumpster. This shall be handled and approved on a case-by-case basis. Should individual garbage cans be allowed, the cans shall be kept in a location approved by the City Manager. The can location shall be screened by a minimum forty-two (42) inches high solid fence or wall when the approved location will be visible from a public right-of-way or from an abutting or functionally abutting residential or mixed-use zoning district. 
2.  Any change from individual garbage cans to a dumpster shall be submitted and reviewed as an amendment to the approved site plan and the dumpster shall meet the requirements of this Section. 
(E)  WAIVERS. 
1.  In any case where the strict application of the requirements of this Section present an undue hardship, the City Manager may waive one (1) or more of the requirements. The City Manager may, in his discretion, refer an application for waiver of dumpster requirements to the City Council, or if a subject parcel is located in the Community Redevelopment District, the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
2.  In determining whether to waive any requirements, the deciding authority shall consider the following criteria: character of the immediately surrounding development; size, configuration, and natural features of the land to be developed; adequacy of off-site improvements; traffic impacts; and nature of the proposed development.

4.  On single-family lots in connection with permitted construction activity, the PSU may remain on the lot for the duration of the Building Permit, but shall be removed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or if the construction activity ceases. In such cases, a PSU may be placed in the rear or side yards, but not in front of the dwelling, and the allowable location of the PSU shall be determined during single-family permit review. 
5.  All PSU shall have the name, current phone number and address of the provider of the PSU with the date the PSU was placed on the site clearly posted on the exterior and facing the street. 
6.  PSU shall be locked and secured by the owner or tenant of the unit or property at all times when loading or unloading is not taking place. Storage of hazardous materials is prohibited.

Sec. 18-1531.1. - PURPOSE. 
    It is the purpose of this Division to provide procedures, regulations, and evaluation criteria for conditional uses, which, because of certain characteristics and potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, may not be appropriate at particular locations within a zoning district, and/or may be appropriate only when subject to additional regulations set forth herein, and individual review of their location, design, scale, configuration, operation, and other characteristics necessary to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular location. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1531.2. - APPLICABILITY. 
    In addition to any other requirements of this Article, all uses listed as a conditional use for a specific zoning district shall be subject to the special requirements for that use as provided for in this Section, and shall not be established or expanded until the use has received approval under the provisions of this Article. 
    Any lawful use, whether permitted or nonconforming, in existence on the effective date of this Code or amendment hereto, and subsequently classified as a "conditional use" in the zoning district in which it is located by virtue of such adoption or amendment, shall be hereby deemed a lawful conditional use for the purpose of this Section. No expansion, alteration, relocation, or change in any characteristic of use shall occur, except in conformance with the requirements of this Section.

(C)  COMPATIBILITY REVIEW CRITERIA. 
1.  Whether the use and its proposed scale will be inconsistent with the established character of the immediate neighborhood, to the extent that such character is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the provisions of the applicable zoning district(s). 
2.  Whether the use will diminish the use or enjoyment of other properties and living or working conditions in the neighborhood. 
3.  Whether the use will impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties for uses permitted in their respective zoning districts and in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
4.  Whether the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use will be detrimental to, or endanger, the public health, safety, comfort, or general welfare as a result of hours of operation, arrangement of uses on the site, noise, vibration, emission or pollutant, glare, odor, dust, traffic congestion, attractive nuisance, or other condition; 
5.  Whether the land area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for the use and reasonably anticipated operations and expansion thereof. 
6.  Whether the use and associated improvements will adversely affect a known archaeological, historical, cultural, or landscape resource 
7.  Whether the particular traffic generation characteristics of the proposed use, including the type of vehicular traffic associated with such uses is compatible with the traffic generation characteristics of other uses permitted in the zoning district(s) applicable to the neighborhood.

Sec. 18-1531.7. - WAIVERS, VARIANCES, MODIFICATIONS. 
(A)  WAIVERS. The City may waive one (1) or more of the requirements of Section 18-1531.10, "List of Conditional Uses and Requirements", that are specific to any given conditional use application, or application to modify an existing conditional use approval, upon finding that the requirement(s) are not necessary to ensure the compatibility and appropriateness of the use at the given location, and upon making the findings listed below. Where City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency has established compatibility with the neighborhood and appropriateness of the use at a public hearing, amendments to the Conditional Use site plan may be made administratively provided conditions and safeguards provided by Council are not proposed to be altered or otherwise compromised in the opinion of the City Manager or his designee, Administrative waivers of conditional use special requirements by City staff are not authorized. Any waiver request for administrative conditional use applications shall trigger City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency review of the conditional use application and waiver request. 
The public notice requirements of Section 18-1534 shall apply to waivers, variances and modifications subject to City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency review and approval. In determining whether such special requirements should be wholly or partially waived, the City shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  The purpose of the requirement is otherwise fully achieved, or more important purposes of this Article or the Comprehensive Plan will be served thereby, or the requirement serves no valid public purpose in the particular case; 
2.  The waiver is consistent with the statement of intent of the applicable zoning district and this Section; 
3.  The waiver will not adversely impact the public interest or adjacent property, and the applicant has demonstrated that all necessary alternative measures shall be taken to prevent any such impact; 
4.  The waiver is not discriminatory, considering similar situations in the general area and in past decisions under this Article. 
(B)  VARIANCES. In conjunction with the consideration of any conditional use, City Council and the Community Redevelopment Agency are empowered to hear and decide those variances the Board of Adjustment is authorized to hear and decide, thus avoiding a duplicate process before City Council, the Community Redevelopment Agency and the Board of Adjustment. In exercising this power and duty, the City Council and Community Redevelopment Agency shall perform within the same standards and procedures as the Board of Adjustment in Section 18-1537, including public notice. 
(C)  PRELIMINARY SITE PLAN AMENDMENTS. The City Manager or his designee may review and approve minor changes to Conditional Use Preliminary Site Plans or Final Site Plans, previously approved in the manner provided by this Article, as follows:

(A)  Requests for extension must be submitted to the Zoning Division no later than thirty-five (35) days prior to the expiration date of the conditional use approval. 
(B)  Staff may approve or deny the request, or may attach conditions to any approved extension, when deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the intent and provisions of this Section, including but not limited to, an extension duration of less than one (1) year. Advisory board review is not required. 
(C)  The conditional use shall comply with all applicable provisions of Chapter 18, Land Development Code, in effect at the time of consideration of the request for extension. This requirement does not override any vesting that may have been established under the Building Code. 
(D)  The Zoning Director may forward a request for extension to the City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency should the Director consider the situation appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1531.9. - APPLICATION MATERIALS FOR CONDITIONAL USES. 
    All applications for conditional use approval requiring site plan approval under Section 18-1541, "Final Site Plan", shall be in accordance with Section 18-1540, "Preliminary Site Plan Requirements", provided that the conditional use approval does not take effect until a final site plan has been approved pursuant to Section 18-1541. Nothing herein shall preclude an applicant from submitting for final site plan approval concurrent with application for conditional use.

SECTION 18-1532. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 18-1532.1. - PURPOSE, INTENT AND APPLICABILITY. 
    It is necessary to establish minimum requirements for facilities and space for the off-street parking of vehicles and loading and unloading of goods in the City, in order to promote the safety of pedestrians and motorists, the orderly movement of people, vehicles and goods, and maintaining the public ways, recognizing that different land uses have varying requirements for off-street parking. 
    All use of land shall provide off-street parking in accordance with the standards and requirements of this Section. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1532.2. - GENERAL REGULATIONS. 
    The following shall apply to the development of all off-street parking within the City of Pinellas Park: 
(A)  All parking lot development shall be designed in accordance with Section 18-1532.6 and the City's engineering specifications on file with the Engineering Services Department. The number, dimensions and marking of handicapped accessible parking spaces shall be designed in accordance with Florida Building Code requirements. 
(B)  This Section establishes the minimum required number of off-street parking and loading spaces for each of the listed land uses. Actual parking and loading demand tends to vary for any one given use from site to site, sometimes significantly. The intent of the minimum standards established in this Section is to accommodate typical weekly peak parking demand for a given use, which may occur on a weekday, weekend, morning, afternoon or evening, depending upon the characteristics of the particular use. Given the variation in parking demand among identical land uses in different locations, Section 18-1532.5 provides for an applicant to submit data supporting alternate parking, loading or stacking requirements, and authorizes the City to approve same. This same process is available for uses that are not listed, but that are similar to a listed use. 
(C)  When a developed property complies with the minimum off-street parking requirements hereunder, but consistently lacks sufficient parking to accommodate actual demand for same, any application for expansion of the use, or for site modification, shall be evaluated as if the existing supply of off-street parking spaces is inadequate and does not conform to the requirements of this Section. The actual parking requirement, in such cases, shall be based upon the demonstrated demand during typical weekly peak parking periods unless the applicant proposes mitigation acceptable to the City. 
(D)  The Zoning Director may require an applicant to perform a study or provide professionally acceptable data demonstrating that the minimum standards set forth in this Section for number of parking, loading, and/or stacking spaces is adequate for the proposed use, when the Zoning Director determines that the characteristics of a proposed use may require additional spaces. 
(E)  For those uses not specifically assigned minimum parking requirements herein, off-street parking shall be provided on the basis of the parking requirements of comparable uses, in the judgment of the Zoning Director. The Zoning Director may also require a study or documentation pursuant to paragraph (D), above, for a use that is not specifically listed in this Section, when in the judgment of the Zoning Director, the parking, stacking and/or loading characteristics of the proposed use are not substantially similar to a listed use. 
(F)  Where parking requirements are linked to the seating capacity of certain occupancies (i.e., auditoriums, stadiums, churches, lodge rooms, etc.) the seating capacities for such occupancies shall, in the absence of fixed-seating, be computed based upon the maximum occupancy of persons allowed under the Florida Building Code, as may be amended from time to time, for the purpose of determining the required number of off-street parking spaces. 
(G)  Fixed bench seating shall be calculated as one (1) seat per each twenty-four (24) linear inches, excluding any fractions thereof. 
(H)  The parking required herein is in addition to space for storage of trucks or other vehicles used in connection with a business, commercial or industrial use. 
(I)  Where fractional spaces result from a required parking calculation the result shall be rounded up, such that the parking, stacking or loading spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. For example, if a parking calculation requires 1.99 spaces, this number shall be rounded up to two (2) spaces. 
(J)  Designated parking spaces and associated vehicular use areas shall be used for vehicular parking only. No sales, rental, storage, repair, servicing of vehicles, equipment or materials, dismantling, or other activities shall be conducted or located in such areas. 
(K)  All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served, except as provided under Section 18-1532.4, "Shared and Off-Site Parking". 
(L)  Parking areas shall be located so as to minimize conflicting movements between vehicles maneuvering in parking aisles and those vehicles traveling into, out of, or through the site. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1532.3. - NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES. 
    Whenever vehicular use areas (VUAs), including required off-street parking or loading facilities, are nonconforming as to any requirements of this Section, the nonconformities may continue subject to the following conditions. 
(A)  SUBSTANDARD VUA SURFACE. As a result of a change or expansion of use, when an existing VUA is unpaved or otherwise has a substandard surface, and such VUA is: 1) increased in size by at least fifty (50) percent; or 2) the number of required parking spaces is increased by at least twenty-five (25) percent, both the new portion and remaining substandard portion shall be improved to the paving and marking standards required herein. 
(B)  NONCONFORMING PARKING OR LOADING FACILITIES. 
1.  When a new use is established, and the required parking is at a higher ratio than the ratio of the use it replaces, parking must be provided based on the new use and current Code requirements. 
2.  Should a building be expanded for an existing use within the building, and the overall existing parking supply for the building or complex does not meet the current requirement, parking must be provided for the expanded use at the current requirement for the new addition. However, parking provided for the existing building area, although nonconforming, does not have to be brought up to current requirements, unless the existing parking surface is substandard, and the percentage thresholds of (A) above have been reached. 
3.  Should State or Federal Disability Accessibility Codes require additional or upgraded disabled-accessible parking spaces, the existing nonconforming parking lot may be upgraded to meet said Code, without penalty to the property owner, even if one (1) or more existing parking spaces are being removed to provide for disabled-accessible spaces. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1532.4. - SHARED AND OFF-SITE PARKING. 
(A)  OFF-SITE PARKING. Required parking for certain nonresidential uses may be provided off-site, within a distance not to exceed four hundred (400) feet measured as the shortest distance between the two (2) properties, along the most direct route of sidewalk access between the properties, provided that: 
1.  The two (2) properties are completely connected by sidewalks and are not separated by a collector or arterial roadway; and 
2.  Appropriate directional signage is provided to advise patrons of the off-site parking and to reserve the off-site parking for the building or use it serves; and 
3.  The use is characterized by relatively infrequent utilization of its full parking facilities and/or a low turnover of parking spaces, such as a theatre, auditorium, arena, auction house, place of worship (excluding parking for day care, administrative offices and elementary school), faculty and student parking for colleges and universities, and employee parking for uses such as hospitals, government buildings, office buildings, banks and other places of substantial employment, or uses with similar parking characteristics. 
(B)  JOINT PARKING FACILITIES. 
1.  The required off-street parking may be collectively provided by two (2) or more uses, however, the number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses if computed separately, except as provided below. 
2.  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Zoning Director that the peak hours of use for two (2) or more establishments on the same lot will not coincide, or a parking demand study certified by a registered engineer determines on the basis of current peak usage that an existing use that is to be the subject of a shared parking agreement has surplus parking spaces, the sum of the parking requirements for said establishments may be reduced; however, said reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of required off-street parking spaces. 
(C)  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT. 
1.  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide the documentation necessary to determine whether the provisions of this section are applicable. 
2.  In any case, where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be recorded and shall be filed with the application for a building permit. A covenant running with the lands shall be recorded noting that the properties have a shared parking arrangement or offsetting peak hour parking arrangement. 
3.  If it is found that the peak hours of operation for establishments utilizing shared parking have become the same or overlap, then all required parking shall be provided if, in the opinion of the Zoning Director, a lack of parking is expressed by "spillover" whereby the lack of parking on site impacts adjacent or other nearby uses. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1532.5. - ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS. 
(A)  The City may approve a parking, loading and/or stacking space needs analysis justifying an alternative parking, loading or stacking generation rate(s) provided by a petitioner for development approval or change of use, if: 
1.  Such alternate rate or requirement is the result of unique operating characteristics of the proposed use or mix of uses; 
2.  If there are distinctions between the demand generated by the proposed use(s) and the standard(s) set forth herein for the most similar use(s) contained in this Section; 
3.  Or, where the petitioner produces recent, professionally acceptable data and analysis demonstrating that an alternate generation rate(s) is more appropriate for a class of use than that contained in this Section. 
(B)  A parking, loading and/or stacking space needs analysis shall include one (1) or more of the following, as applicable, to support the needs analysis: 
1.  Estimates of parking, loading and/or stacking space needs based on recommendations in studies such as those from the Urban Land Institute, Institute of Traffic Engineers, or industry standards based on data collected from geographic areas and uses or combinations of uses that are similar to the proposed uses(s). The analysis shall document the source of the data used to develop particular recommendations. 
2.  Actual parking, loading and/or stacking space counts for a similar development indicating that the full complement of spaces is not required. Such counts shall be taken during peak demand parking and drive-thru hours. 
3.  An analysis of the extent to which other options exist that would lessen on-site parking requirements. 
4.  An operational procedure indicating that the full complement of spaces is not required and a guarantee of continuity of such operational procedure. 
(C)  The needs analysis shall include a statement of remedies in the event the City makes a future determination that the full complement of spaces is required. In the event that the City makes a future determination that insufficient spaces exist, the property owner shall be notified by certified mail that a remedy shall be implemented within sixty (60) days, as may be extended by the City Manager for just cause. A determination of insufficiency shall be made using one (1) or more of the following methods: monitoring of the parking, loading or stacking as applicable; parking, loading or stacking in the rights-of-way caused by insufficient off-street facilities; or, verified complaints of parking, stacking or loading on neighboring properties in connection with the property in question. 
(D)  The City, when reviewing such data, should consider the future adaptability of the site, given the reduced parking, loading or stacking spaces, for the same use with more typical operational characteristics, as well as other land uses. 
(E)  The petitioner shall execute an agreement with the City, setting forth the terms of the alternative generation standard, which may require recalculation based upon changes to the business operation, and/or other terms and conditions the City deems necessary to ensure the alternative calculation will remain appropriate. 
(F)  In order for any development to qualify for an alternative standard, the development must comply with all applicable architectural and urban design guidelines, and shall provide an additional twenty (20) percent landscaping material on site. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1532.6. - SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS FOR PARKING LOT DEVELOPMENT. 
(A)  CIRCULATION. 
1.  Off-street parking areas shall be designed to ensure safe and efficient traffic circulation, with consideration given to the surrounding street plan, traffic volumes, proposed street improvements, vehicular street capacities, and pedestrian movements and safety. The parking facilities shall be of sufficient size and configuration to allow necessary functions for loading, unloading and parking maneuvers to be carried out on private property, and completely off the street right-of-way, unless otherwise specifically permitted. 
2.  Parking facility design shall provide for a clearly defined vehicular circulation system, which allows free movement within the proposed site while discouraging excessive speed, and allows efficient and orderly circulation that minimizes congestion. 
3.  Pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems shall be adequately separated for pedestrian safety. 
4.  All off-street parking areas, with the exception of those required for attached or detached single-family homes, shall be designed so that no vehicle is required to back directly into a public street right-of-way (exclusive of alleys) to obtain egress, and so that no vehicle shall be required to use a public street right-of-way (exclusive of alleys) for direct movement into or out of individual parking spaces. The establishment of new back-out parking for single-family homes is prohibited along collector and arterial roadways. Furthermore, no required parking spaces may be located directly in front of vehicular access openings to buildings; all such access bays must remain accessible. 
5.  Lighting shall be consistent with the latest recommendations of the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) document RP-20-98, Lighting for Parking Facilities, as may be amended from time to time. 
(B)  SURFACE. All off-street parking and access ways shall be paved with pervious or impervious surfaces as approved by the City Engineer and marked in accordance with the standard specifications of the City of Pinellas Park, except as provided below. 
1.  Pervious material may be substituted where approved by the City Engineer based on sound engineering and traffic principles and consistency with an approved drainage plan. 
2.  Where it can be shown that the use of all spaces of a parking lot or portion thereof is equal to or less than an average of six (6) vehicular parking events (i.e., one (1) vehicle parking in and leaving a space) per space per week, such parking areas need not be paved to City Standards and may utilize an unpaved surface for parking and circulation, provided the surface is stabilized to professionally accepted standards. Such parking areas shall be clearly delineated with wheel stops, border chain, shrubs or other suitable materials to clearly show the general parking scheme intended. In addition, that portion of the access to the lot lying within City right-of-way shall be paved and improved to City Standards as required by the City Engineer. 
(C)  PARKING SPACE DIMENSIONS. Unless otherwise specified herein, each off-street parking space shall have a minimum net area of one-hundred sixty-two (162) square feet, and minimum dimensions of nine (9) feet by eighteen (18) feet exclusive of access drives or aisles that provide access thereto, without requiring another automobile to be moved or otherwise requiring access over or through any other parking space, except as provided herein for valet parking and/or funeral homes/chapels. 
1.  A driveway, as well as a carport, that meets the dimensional requirements of this provision, may be counted as off-street parking spaces for single-family homes, regardless of the need to move one (1) automobile in order to afford ingress and egress for another automobile. 
2.  A garage or carport, and a driveway servicing a garage or carport, that meets the dimensional requirements of this provision, may be counted as off-street parking spaces for attached single-family homes, duplex and townhome units to which the garage or carport is attached, regardless of the need to move one (1) automobile in order to afford ingress and egress for another automobile, subject to Subsection (A)4., above. If a homeowner subsequently encumbers garage or carport space in a manner that eliminates its functional use as a parking space, then that space shall be replaced in another acceptable manner and location within a timeframe to be determined by the Zoning Director. 
3.  No parking space shall be designed or constructed so as to encroach on any sidewalk, pedestrian way or required landscape area. The use of wheelstops and or grass strips two (2) feet in width between the curb and pedestrian way shall be installed where conflicts arise. Such a two (2) feet wide grass strip shall not qualify as interior green (VUA landscape) as described in Section 18-1533, Landscaping. 
4.  A standard off-street parallel parking space shall measure nine (9) feet by twenty-three (23) feet. 
5.  The width of a parking space shall be increased by two (2) feet where adjacent to fences, walls or curbs above six (6) inches in height. 
(D)  ACCESS AISLES. 
1.  Dimensions. Ingress and/or egress aisles shall be properly marked and designated and shall have the following width dimensions, provided that the Florida Fire Prevention Code requires at least one means of ingress into a site at a minimum of twenty (20) feet (where feasible the required width can be assumed from an adjacent aisle) in width: 
One Way: Minimum - twelve (12) feet 
maximum sixteen (16) feet (except fire lanes which shall be 20 feet of unrestricted access width.) Two Way: Minimum - twenty-four (24) feet 
Maximum - forty (40) feet Right turn radius (ingress and egress): Minimum: fifteen (15) feet Maximum: twenty-five (25) feet  
2.  Two-way directional movement requires a minimum aisle of twenty-four (24) feet regardless of parking angle. 
3.  If a parking aisle requires access for emergency vehicles, garbage trucks or trucks moving to or from a loading area, that parking aisle shall be at least twenty-four (24) feet wide. 
4.  Parking stalls abutting the same continuous parking aisle shall have the same angle and orientation. Parking aisles less than twenty-four (24) feet wide and aisles abutting parking stalls with angles of less than ninety (90) degrees, shall be one-way only. Parking stall angles and parking aisle direction of flow may change only when the parking aisle is interrupted by a circulation drive, structure, or landscape median or similar feature. 
5.  All required parking stalls shall have direct and unobstructed access from a parking aisle. 
6.  When a row of parking stalls is immediately adjacent to a right-of-way, a minimum stacking area of twenty-five (25) feet is required between the property line and the entrance to the first stall. See Figure 18-1532-1, below. 
FIGURE 18-1532-1 MINIMUM STACKING AREA ADJACENT TO RIGHT-OF-WAY 

7.  Dead-end parking aisles are prohibited, except where a double-loaded dead-end aisle serves fewer than twenty-one (21) parking spaces and a turnaround area is provided that will accommodate a three (3) point turnaround, or where the number of parking spaces in the double-loaded dead-end aisle is ten (10) or fewer (AASHTO "P" Design Vehicle). 
(E)  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANGLED PARKING SCHEMES. The following dimensions shall be utilized for the development of angled (less than ninety (90) degrees) spaces. Other layout arrangements (herringbone, hybrids) may be approved provided they meet common industry standards. 
FIGURE 18-1532-2 TYPICAL ANGLED PARKING LAYOUT 

(F)  SIGNAGE AND MARKINGS. Traffic control signs and delineation and other pavement markings shall be used as necessary to ensure safe and efficient traffic operation of parking areas. All parking spaces shall be delineated by painted lines, curbs, and/or other means to indicate individual spaces. Please reference the MUTCD (Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices) for guidance. 
1.  Emergency vehicle access requirements. When necessary for adequate accessibility for fire protection purposes, emergency access for fire rescue apparatus, equipment and operations shall conform to the requirements of the Florida Fire Prevention Code. 
(G)  ATTENDANT PARKING. In the case of buildings wherein the owner supplies and maintains the services of attendants to receive, park and deliver the automobile of occupants, tenants, customers and visitors, with or without charge, the required minimum width of each parking space shall be eight and one-half (81/2) feet. All spaces need not be directly accessible provided for any parking space to be accessible, no more than two (2) spaces may be crossed into when parking a motor vehicle. Such reductions in parking space width and change in accessibility shall be authorized under the following conditions: 
1.  Permission for such attendant parking shall be evidenced by the recordation of an attendant off-street parking agreement, showing the required attendant parking spaces to be maintained, which restriction shall be deemed a covenant running with the land. 
2.  After completed construction based upon approved plans and specifications providing for such attendant parking, areas designated for attendant parking shall not be used without providing the service of attendants. 
(H)  LIGHTING. Lighting shall be provided and maintained in accordance with Section 18-1503.15, "Illumination".

SECTION 18-1533. - LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 18-1533.1. - PURPOSE AND INTENT. 
    The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum standards for the development, installation, and maintenance of landscaped pervious areas within the City. The problems associated with intense urban development have become of increasing concern to the residents of the City. It is recognized that the proper management and use of trees, plants and other types of vegetation will reduce the impact of this rapid growth and improve the appearance, value, character, and quality of the urban environment. It is the intent of this Section, therefore, that the establishment of these minimum requirements and encouragement of resourceful planning and creative design promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. This Section is further intended to fulfill objectives as contained within the City's Comprehensive Plan, and the Community Redevelopment Plan by providing for: The conservation of potable and non-potable water; the implementation of Xeriscape landscaping principles; maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge; encouraging the preservation of existing plant communities; encouraging the planting of site specific, native and drought tolerant plant materials; establishing guidelines for the installation and maintenance of landscape materials and irrigation systems; reducing air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees; reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process of evapotranspiration; and promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade.

2.  Turf or Sod. Portions of landscaped areas that have been customarily designed as lawns shall be planted in traditional mixes of trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Lawn grass shall be planted in specific zones, and adhere to the irrigation requirements found in Section 18-1533.20, "Installation and Maintenance Requirements". Lawn grass is specifically required between the property line and edge of pavement within the street right-of-way. 
3.  Acceptable varieties of grass are St. Augustine, Bahia and their cultivars. When used, lawn grass shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests and diseases. For new developments when grass areas are to be seeded, sprigged, or plugged, specifications must be approved by the City Manager. Seeded areas shall be covered with one-quarter (1/4) inch of topsoil, and a thin layer of hay/straw. One hundred (100) percent coverage must be achieved within thirty (30) days, for all pervious area not treated with other approved ground cover, including the right-of-way swale. Nurse grass must be sown for immediate effect and protection against soil erosion until coverage is otherwise achieved. To the maximum extent feasible, and as required in (C) below, drought tolerant lawn grass species must be utilized. Solid sod only shall be required on lots located within the Community Redevelopment Area, except where hedges or ground cover, as defined in (A) and (B) above, are utilized. 
(C)  DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANTS. For increased water conservation, the applicant shall utilize no less than fifty (50) percent drought tolerant shrubs, ground cover, and lawn grasses, as specified on lists obtainable from City and County/State agencies. 
(D)  HARDSCAPE MATERIALS. Non-living durable materials may be used as part of an overall landscape program, but shall not be credited as landscaping.

Sec. 18-1533.16. - REQUIRED PERIMETER LANDSCAPE BUFFERS. 
(A)  APPLICABILITY. All development shall provide buffer landscaping along the non-street perimeters of the lot according to Table 18-1533-2, below. For purposes of this Section, buffer landscaping shall consist of a combination of trees; shrubs; ground cover, and/or lawn grass. Additional landscaping materials may be incorporated provided these basic components are included. 
(B)  GUIDE TO USE OF THE TABLE. To use the table, locate the appropriate zoning district on the left side of the table of the property to be developed. Next, identify the zoning of the abutting property to each side of the subject property. The number or letter located at the intersection of the corresponding row and column indicates the required landscaping standard applicable for the abutting property (see the notes to the table). Depending upon the zoning of the adjacent property, the buffering may be different along each property line. In any case where this Section conflicts with the standard landscaping requirements, the requirements of this Section shall govern. In addition, buffer landscaping required in this Section may be utilized to fulfill the requirements of the landscaping requirements in Sections 18-1533.15 and 18-1533.17. 
(C)  If the abutting property is zoned PUD, the buffer landscaping standards to be applied shall be the same standards applied to that zoning district in Table 18-1533-2 that is the most similar in development to the subject PUD parcel.

NOTES/LEGEND: 
1.  Refer to Table 18-1533-3 VUA Buffer Requirements for specific buffering requirements. 
2.  Buffering/landscaping requirements in the "P" Public District shall be established on a case-by-case basis. In determining which standard to use, the City Council shall consider the following criteria: 
(a)  If the proposed use will cause adverse impacts (e.g. visual, noise, odor) to the abutting property. 
(b)  If the proposed use will cause adverse impacts (e.g. sedimentation, pollution, erosion) to the natural environment of the abutting property. 
(c)  If the proposed use will cause a potential safety hazard to abutting property, making a buffer area necessary. The buffering/landscaping requirements shall, however, at a minimum, meet the requirements of Standard "A". 
3.  Refer to Section 18-408, "Environmental Habitat Preservation and Enhancement, "(E)" Upland Buffers Adjacent To Wetlands," and Table 18-1533-3, Perimeter Buffer Specifications. 
A - Refer to Table 18-1533-3, Buffer Type A 
B - Refer to Table 18-1533-3, Buffer Type B 
C- Refer to Table 18-1533-3, Buffer Type C 
D- Refer to Table 18-1533-3, Buffer Type D (Where an M-1 parcel is being developed in a location that abuts or functionally abuts residential districts, City Council, in the review of the required site plan, may require additional buffering to ameliorate impacts.)

General Table Notes: 
1.  All measurements include fractions thereof. 
2.  All tree planting areas must have minimum dimensions pursuant to Table 18-1533-1. 
3.  Perimeter buffer requirements are not intended to result in duplicate or double buffers. Therefore, when any two (2) or more buffers are required based upon streetscaping, VUA and perimeter buffer standards, the stricter standard shall apply. 
4.  The remainder of required landscape buffers shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other acceptable vegetation. Paving, sand, pebbles, or rocks are not acceptable materials. 
5.  Where canopy trees are to be used in borders and in conjunction with hedges, hedge areas are to be consolidated elsewhere on the property. 
Specific Footnotes: 
*In groupings of four (4) or more (intended to maximize the physical effectiveness and soften the visual impact of the buffer.) 
1.  Not required for: 
(a)  any portion of a vehicular use area that is entirely screened from an abutting property, right-of-way, or residential or mixed use zoning district by an intervening building. 
(b)  a vehicular use area that is accessory to single-family, duplex or mobile home (T-1) residential uses. 
(c)  lot perimeters that have a stricter buffer requirement based upon Tables 1 and 2. 
(d)  the portion of a vehicular use area that abuts an alley. 
2.  Table 18-1533-1 specifies the minimum dimensions of pervious area needed for intermediate and canopy trees in order to accommodate their root systems. 
3.  Where such dimension exceeds the minimum required buffer width, either the buffer shall be of the minimum width specified in said table in the locations that such trees are planted, or abutting private property or right-of-way pervious areas can be counted towards the extra required width. 
(D)  NON-DUPLICATION OF BUFFERS. Where a portion of a proposed vehicular use area would abut an existing hedge or wall on an abutting property, the City Manager may waive the shrub and tree requirements; however, the required landscaped strip, planted with grass, ground cover or other acceptable vegetative materials shall be maintained in all cases. Additionally, a covenant running with the land shall be recorded requiring the installation of the waived buffer content in the event that the existing buffer is legally removed. The existing barrier shall meet all other applicable standards of this Section and protection against vehicular encroachment shall be provided. Criteria used to determine if these requirements may be waived are as follows: 
1.  If the natural or man made feature(s) or the existing abutting landscape plants effectively create a buffer, thus meeting the intent of the buffer requirement. 
2.  If the natural or man made feature(s) or the existing abutting landscape plants are in good repair and/or in healthy condition. 
3.  If the existing abutting landscape plants are composed of species acceptable pursuant to this Section. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1533.17. - INTERIOR VUA LANDSCAPING. 
(A)  PROTECTION FROM VEHICULAR ENCROACHMENT. Vehicular use areas shall be designed to use wheel stops, bollards, and/or raised concrete curbing to prevent the encroachment of vehicles upon or into landscaped areas. That part of a driveway which is within the right-of-way shall be exempt from this requirement. Wood or railroad ties are not acceptable for use as wheel stops except as may be applied in grass parking areas where such is permitted by this Code. 
(B)  REQUIRED AMOUNT OF LANDSCAPED AREA. An area or combination of areas equal to eight (8) percent of the total vehicular use area shall be devoted to interior landscaping. An area or combination of areas equal to ten (10) percent of the vehicular use area shall be devoted to interior landscaping for lots located within the Community Redevelopment Area. Interior landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the monotony of paving, to provide shaded areas and to delineate the intended traffic pattern(s). This includes only those areas that actually protrude into the parking lot and vehicular use areas, such as (but not limited to) interior and terminal landscape islands and parking row separators, that are capable of supporting trees as specified in the requirements of this Section. In no case shall less than one (1) tree for each two hundred (200) square feet or fraction thereof of such required landscaping be provided. This subsection shall not apply to single-family, duplex, and mobile home (T-1) residential uses. Parking lots with ten (10) or fewer parking spaces are exempt from this requirement. 
(C)  TERMINAL ISLANDS. 
1.  Each row of ten (10) or more contiguous parking spaces within the Community Redevelopment Area, and fifteen (15) or more contiguous parking spaces elsewhere, shall be terminated on both ends by landscaped islands of a size not less than five (5) feet in width, as measured inside the curbing and having a length equal to that of the adjacent parking stall. The designer shall reference a landscape plan to insure that where trees are planned, that the island is sized large enough to properly accommodate the tree. 
2.  Landscaping shall consist, at a minimum, of one (1) tree plus lawn grass or ground cover. 
3.  Selection of tree types should be sensitive to locations of light poles and signage. 
(D)  INTERIOR ISLANDS AND GREENSPACE PARKING ROW DIVIDERS. 
1.  Interior islands shall be placed within rows of contiguous parking spaces at intervals of not more than fifteen (15) spaces, and ten (10) spaces within the Community Redevelopment Area. 
2.  Interior islands and green space parking row dividers shall be no less than ten (10) feet in width as measured inside the curbing, and all interior islands shall have a length equal to that of the adjacent parking stall. 
3.  Landscaping shall, at a minimum, consist of one (1) tree plus lawn grass or ground cover. 
(E)  CONSOLIDATION OF LANDSCAPE ISLANDS. In order to provide for more growing space for trees within vehicular use areas, to allow clustering of trees, to allow for flexibility of design, and to preserve existing trees of value, the consolidation of interior landscaped islands may be permitted in parking areas, upon approval by the City Manager, provided that the overall interior landscaping requirements are met, and based upon the following criteria used to determine if interior landscaped areas may be consolidated: 
1.  The consolidated areas must meet the intent and definition of interior landscaped areas; and 
2.  The consolidated areas must offer increased growing area for the roots of trees, thus allowing for larger shade producing canopy type trees to grow and function within vehicular use areas; or 
3.  The consolidated areas must preserve trees of value that would otherwise have to be removed or relocated in order to accommodate the required vehicular use area; or 
4.  Consolidating interior landscaped areas will result in superior site design or increase the efficiency of the internal function and design of specialized vehicular use areas (i.e. truck depot yards, loading areas, auto auctions, etc.). 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1533.18. - TREE AND NATIVE VEGETATION PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS. 
    The following landscaping practices are required for the retention of existing, natural vegetation to the maximum extent possible. 
(A)  PRESERVATION REQUIRED. Where healthy trees and native vegetation of species exist pursuant to Article 4, "Environmental Habitat Preservation and Enhancement," and this Section, it shall be required to the maximum extent possible that they be retained on the site and to be credited toward meeting the required number of trees required by Code. 
Where existing native vegetation in good health meets the criteria for denial of a permit for its removal under said Article 4, and falls within the proposed building or vehicular use area, the City Manager may require a reasonable alteration of the site plan within the context of this Section in order to protect this vegetation, subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The proposed alteration does not create undue hardship or further limit the economic enjoyment of the subject property. 
2.  Credit toward meeting the minimum planting requirements is allowable for the vegetation protected by this action as described herein. 
3.  Any proposed alteration of the plan for vegetation preservation shall also be reviewed and approved by other City Departments/Divisions as necessary. 
(B)  EXCEPTIONS. Where the developer has shown that sufficient steps in the planning of the project site have been taken to ensure the preservation of this type vegetation, and that further conservation will severely limit the use of the subject property for the purposes intended, the City Manager may authorize removal of existing tree(s). 
(C)  TREE CREDITS.

1.  Palms shall be allowed credit as follows: For palm species listed in Section 18-1533.10(B)4., "Tree Material Standards," "Understory Tree; palms," having a height of eight (8) feet or greater, which are preserved on a site, a credit of one (1) understory tree shall be allowed for every three (3) existing palms preserved. Credit for other palms native to Florida and indigenous to Pinellas County may be allowed to meet tree planting requirements as determined by the City Manager where the height, species, location and other factors can be effectively utilized to meet the intent of this Section. (See Section 18-1533.11, "Alternative Species" for criteria used to determine if other species will be acceptable.) 
2.  Where existing trees are to be credited toward the minimum requirements of this Section, the following Table 3 shall be used to determine the minimum undisturbed area to remain after construction. Tree protection standards required by Article 4, "Environmental Habitat Preservation and Enhancement" of the Land Development Code may require a larger area to be protected during construction. These standards are minimum requirements. To increase the survival chances for trees of twelve (12) inches DBH or greater intensive tree care during the recovery period may be necessary. In all cases the owner/developer must take all steps necessary to assure survival of those trees designated to remain on site.

Sec. 18-1533.19. - ALTERNATIVE LANDSCAPING PRACTICES. 
    The following alternative landscaping practices are permitted to further encourage the use of innovative landscape designs. 
(A)  Architectural planters may be utilized in fulfillment of the open space requirement for a particular zoning district; however, the use of such architectural planters shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the open space area requirement except as provided in Section 18-1533.21(A), "Alternative Landscape Requirements for Lots Located in the Community Redevelopment Area". Architectural planters shall contain a surface area of not less than ten (10) square feet and shall have a minimum height/depth of not less than three (3) feet. Architectural planters must be provided with adequate soil, whose depth, texture, structure, and pH is capable of providing a compatible medium for the proposed landscape plants. 
(B)  Where existing natural vegetation and/or topographic features (e.g.-wetlands, uplands) are preserved and incorporated into the landscaping scheme so as to meet the intent of this Section, one (1) or more of the requirements of in this Section, concerning streetscape landscaping, interior landscape areas, or buffer landscaping, may be waived (for special provisions, refer to Section 18-408, "Environmental Habitat Preservation and Enhancement, "(E)" Upland Buffers Adjacent To Wetlands and "(F)" Upland Preservation Areas"). 
(C)  The use of an earthen berm in lieu of a wall or fence is acceptable provided that the following design standards are followed: 
1.  Such a berm shall be constructed at a four-to-one (4 to 1) slope and shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet. 
2.  The sides shall be covered in either grass or ground cover. 
3.  The top of the berm shall be planted with shrubs of a height so that the overall height of the berm and shrubs is equal to six (6) feet from the highest abutting grade. 
4.  All other requirements of this Section shall apply, including tree planting requirements. 
(D)  The City Manager may reduce the requirement for off-street parking spaces within any zoning district outside of the Community Redevelopment Area when trees of value are endangered. A tree of value shall be any tree of eight (8) inch DBH or greater, and of any species identified in this Section as being acceptable. In no case shall this reduction exceed ten (10) percent of the required number of parking spaces. 
(E)  The use of turf blocks as a means of preserving existing trees and shrubbery is permitted, provided that the developer follows proper design criteria according the manufacturer's specifications for installation of such, and upon approval by the City Engineer. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1533.20. - INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
(A)  All required landscaping shall be installed according to generally accepted planting procedures and shall be installed so as to meet all applicable ordinances and Code requirements. 
(B)  In order to provide increased moisture retention within the root balls of newly planted and immature trees and shrubs and to further increase the probability of survival and proper growth of such vegetation, a minimum of two (2) inches thickness of mulch no less than twenty-four (24) inches beyond the trunk or stem of all newly planted trees or shrubs shall be installed and maintained during the first year of growth. 
(C)  All landscaped areas shall be provided with an approved automatic irrigation system or available water supply with at least one (1) hose connection within fifty (50) feet of all plant material to be maintained. Individual planters and isolated planting areas shall have appropriate irrigation sources provided within each separate planting area. An automatic irrigation system must be utilized on all lots with nonresidential and mixed uses, and any multi-family uses greater than one-half (1/2) acre in size. Hose bibs may be utilized for irrigation of single-family, mobile home subdivisions (T-1), duplex, and multi-family zoned lots of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size. 
1.  All irrigation systems shall be maintained in an operable condition capable of providing adequate irrigation to landscaped areas as required. All inoperable irrigation systems and components thereof shall be promptly repaired or replaced such that adequate coverage of landscaped areas is restored. 
2.  To conserve water, all applicants must conform to Xeriscape landscape designs to the greatest extent feasible. Xeriscape is defined as water conservation through creative landscaping. It specifically addresses seven (7) steps: 
(a)  Carefully planned design. 
(b)  Selection of appropriate plants for placement in three (3) distinct water consumption zones: Natural Zone-Least watering (plants live on natural rainfall) Drought Tolerant Zone-Little watering (plants only need watering during periods of extended drought) Oasis Zone -Frequent watering (lawn grass, fruit and vegetable gardens). 
(c)  Improve the soil with compost, peat, manure, top soil. 
(d)  Use of turf wisely only in recreation and leisure areas. 
(e)  Irrigation, efficiently utilizing the zones and providing low volume irrigation systems. 
(f)  Use mulches around all plants. 
(g)  Practice proper maintenance by not over watering and over fertilizing. 
3.  The applicant shall utilize efficient irrigation relying on proper irrigation system design and the appropriate equipment. Irrigation systems shall be zoned so that plant groupings can be watered separately, according to the area's need. "Bubblers", micro-sprays, or a drip system can help provide efficient water use. Water needs change, and automatic shut-off devices shall be installed so that landscapes are not irrigated during periods of rain. 
No private inground irrigation systems shall be permitted within any public right-of-way without a right-of-way use permit. 
4.  No in-ground irrigation system shall be permitted to connect to the City Potable Water System. Refer to Section 10-128 of the City Code of Ordinances, for variance procedure for single-family residences. 
(D)  Landscaping plants, trees, and other material shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition or shall be promptly replaced within thirty (30) days. This replacement requirement includes all trees and shrubs, which fall below Florida Grade one or better standards, and whose above ground portion dies back to fifty (50) percent or less of living canopy. Top pruning or other severe pruning or maintenance practice(s) of landscaping materials that results in stunted, abnormal, or other unreasonable deviation from the normal healthy growth of trees, shrubs, and other required landscaping components shall be considered as the destruction of these materials and replacement shall be required as described herein or in Article 4, "Environmental Habitat Preservation and Enhancement" of the Land Development Code. All new and existing trees, shrubs, and other ground cover located within lots so designated as wetlands preservation areas, uplands preservation areas, upland buffer adjacent to wetlands, and other City, State, or County designated wildlife preservation areas, which are credited in this Section or Article 4 of the Land Development Code, shall remain under management as specified by an approved management or landscape plan. This shall include the continued removal of invading nuisance exotic plant species as needed, and as required by the original approved plan. Failure of the owner of the property to maintain the premises in good condition, as set forth above, is punishable as a violation of this Land Development Code. 
(E)  No landscaped area may be abandoned, paved, encroached upon by vehicular traffic, or otherwise employed, without submission of a site plan and approval by the City pursuant to the procedures set forth herein. 
(F)  It shall be the responsibility of the owner, tenant, or agent of developed properties to maintain the right-of-way area beyond the property line contiguous to the site. 
(G)  All provisions of this Section shall apply and remain enforceable notwithstanding changes in property ownership. 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1533.21. - ALTERNATIVE LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS FOR LOTS LOCATED IN THE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AREA. 
(A)  If architectural planters are to be utilized in fulfillment of the greenspace and buffer area requirements, such use shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the greenspace and buffer area requirements. An architectural planter is either a decorative container that by itself adds aesthetic value, or an individual in-ground planting area surrounded by impervious area, and may be covered with a tree grate. Each architectural planter shall contain at least one (1) approved tree. All planters shall have a minimum planting surface area of ten (10) square feet and depth of not less than three (3) feet. Architectural planters must be provided with adequate soil, so that depth, texture, structure and pH is capable of providing a compatible growing medium for the proposed tree. The replacement of architectural planters and the trees planted within them, as later maintenance needs arise, shall require City approval, at no cost to the applicant, to ensure that the owner replaces them with acceptable new planters and trees that meet Code requirements. Any such replacement of architectural planters and the trees within them shall require a final inspection by the City. 
(B)  Where space is limited on a developed lot, trellises may be utilized in fulfillment of the greenspace and buffer area requirements, but such use shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the greenspace and buffer area requirements. Trellises may be installed in landscape beds along the sides of buildings and other visible locations to enhance a landscape design. Trellises must be designed so as not to obstruct vehicular visibility on the owner's or agent's lot or on neighboring lots. Landscape credit for trellises is calculated as the vertical area of the face of the trellis. 
(C)  The removal of asphalt or concrete to achieve compliance with interior greenspace and buffer area requirements is encouraged, but shall not be required if the removal of asphalt or concrete would result in the loss of parking spaces, or substantially impede the operation of the vehicular use area. 
(D)  All landscape areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment through the installation of at least six-inch high concrete curbing or other similar barrier acceptable to the City Manager. 
(E)  For existing lots landscaped under landscaping standards effective prior to the adoption of this Section which cannot satisfy any given landscaping requirement(s) (ex: VUA interior, perimeter buffer, streetscape) of this Section due to physical site constraints, said landscape requirement(s) may be mitigated on other parts of the lot where the constraints do not exist. For example, the perimeter landscape area over and above the minimum requirement may be substituted for interior landscaping requirements on a pro rata basis, where such interior requirements cannot be met. 
(F)  This Section shall not apply to the front of any existing lot landscaped under landscaping standards effective prior to the adoption of this Section that contains buildings with zero lot line walls and/or building fronts that extend to the street right-of-way line (particularly on lots with widths of fifty (50) feet or less), but only as to that portion of the lot where there is no space to create landscape beds or to place planters or trellises. However, in that event, the landscape upgrading required by this Section shall be installed on such lots in the rear parking area(s). 
(Ord. No. 3748, § 3, 10-28-2010) 
Sec. 18-1533.22. - WAIVERS. 
(A)  In any case where the strict application of the requirements of this Section present an undue hardship, the City Council, or the Community Redevelopment Agency (for lots located within the Community Redevelopment Area) may waive one (1) or more of the requirements imposed under this Section. An application for a landscape waiver shall be submitted to the Zoning Director, and shall include a letter of explanation of the circumstances necessitating the waiver. A site plan of the property identifying existing landscaping, as well as any proposed required landscaping, shall be submitted with applicable fees. 
(B)  In determining whether any requirements of this Section should be waived, the City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency, as applicable, shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  Purpose of Requirement. Whether the purpose of the requirement is otherwise fully achieved, or more important purposes of this Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, or the Community Redevelopment Plan will be served thereby, or the requirement serves no valid public purpose in the particular case; 
2.  Public Interest, Adjacent Property. Whether the waiver will create an adverse impact; on the public interest or on the adjacent property, and whether all necessary alternative measures shall be taken by the applicant to prevent any such impact; 
3.  Property Size Configuration, Natural Feature. Whether the size, configuration, and/or natural features of the property involved present a hardship on the development of the property; 
4.  Surrounding Property. The size, character, configuration, zoning, natural features of and use of the surrounding property; and 
5.  Hardship. Whether the need for the waiver is the result of a self-imposed hardship. 
(C)  The City Council, or Community Redevelopment Agency, as applicable, may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the waiver based on the standards set forth above. The granting of any waiver may be subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Section, and may include a requirement that the developer install additional buffering in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse impact of the proposed use upon the adjacent uses and to the neighborhood. 
The type of conditions that may be applied to waivers of Section 18-1533.21, "Alternative Landscape Requirements for Lots Located in the Community Redevelopment Area", include, but are not limited to, providing for some amount of landscape upgrading, which may include tree(s) in architectural planters, installation of trellises, installation of hanging baskets with living plants, or a combination of these. Where the City Council, or Community Redevelopment Agency, as appropriate, approves or approves with conditions a waiver of Landcaping requirements pursuant to this Section, a cash payment shall be deposited into the Tree Bank account equal to the cost of materials (plants, soil amendments, ground anchors etc.) and installation (labor) that would be borne by the developer/contractor for establishing the buffer requested to be waived. In this case, the developer shall provide to the Zoning Division a schedule of the itemized cost of materials and labor required to install the buffer that is the subject of the requested waiver. Said schedule shall be signed and sealed by a professional engineer, architect, landscape architect or certified/licensed arborist. 
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the waiver is approved, shall be deemed a violation of this Article. 
(D)  EXPIRATION. Approval of a waiver as required by this Section shall expire and be void one (1) year after the date of such approval unless (i) a valid building permit(s) for construction is then in effect, or (ii) occupancy has not been lawfully established on the site. Additionally, the applicant must complete all landscape conditions as required by the City Council or Community Redevelopment Agency within one (1) year of the date of approval or prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first.

Article 16. - Pinellas Park Concurrency Management System[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 3982, § 1, adopted May 12, 2016, amended Article 16 in its entirety to read as herein set out. The former Article 16, §§ 18-1601-18-1615, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for history. 

Sec. 18-1601. - AUTHORITY. 
    This Article is adopted in compliance with, and pursuant to, the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, Section 163.3184, et seq., Florida Statutes (1989), as amended. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1602. - LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. 
(A)  All of the above recitals are incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
(B)  The following statements, are hereby adopted by reference as the Legislative Findings of the City Council for the City which shall act as further justification and authority for the adoption of this Article; to that end, the City Council finds that: 
1.  It is the purpose of this Article to establish a Concurrency Management System that ensures that facilities and services needed to support land development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development. The Concurrency Management System is intended to ensure that adopted levels of service standards for potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and drainage shall not be degraded below the levels adopted in the City of Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan by the issuance of a development permit or order. 
2.  The City desires to establish a Concurrency Management System which informs the citizens about infrastructure deficiencies, creates reasonable options to mitigate such deficiencies and allows development to the extent necessary to prevent "Taking of property without just compensation." 
3.  Not all such development activity impacts are significant enough to cause the deterioration of the level of service as adopted in the City of Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan. It is, therefore, further found that a minimal development impact which, alone or in combination with other impacts, will not cause an unacceptable degradation of existing levels of service is consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the City of Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan. Finally, application of this methodology is found to be substantially related to the preservation of individual, private property rights in accordance with the State Comprehensive Plan. 
4.  That this Article is adopted pursuant to the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. § 163.3184, et seq.

Sec. 18-1604. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM-PROCEDURE. 
(A)  APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT. The concurrency management system is accessed by the property owner, or his/her representative, when an application for development containing the required documentation for the given development order or permit is submitted to the City. The City Manager or his designee shall then ascertain the completeness of the documentation, to verify that the information therein is sufficient to accept the application for development for review. 
(B)  APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT REVIEW. 
1.  When the application for a development order or permit has been accepted, it shall be processed and reviewed in accordance with established procedures. These procedures shall include an initial review of the application for impacts of the proposed development for the four (4) public facilities and services identified in this Article, as they may apply. 
2.  If the application for development as submitted does not contain all required information, then the application for development shall be returned to the property owner or his representative with a statement delineating the deficiencies. 
(C)  MINIMUM CONCURRENCY CRITERIA. For potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, and solid waste, the following are minimum standards, which when met, will satisfy the concurrency requirement: 
1.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development order or permit is issued; or 
2.  A development order or permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur; or 
3.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a development order or permit is issued; or 
4.  At the time a development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are subject of a binding executed contract to which the City is a party which provides for the commencement of the actual construction of the required facilities within one (1) year of the issuance of the development order/permit; or 
5.  The necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement acceptable to the City which requires the commencement of the facilities within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable development order/permit; or 
6.  The public facilities are required by the applicable capital improvements element to be constructed and completed when the impacts of development occur. 
(D)  CONCURRENCY TEST STATEMENT APPLIED. 
1.  After an application for development is accepted it will be reviewed and compared to the most recent Concurrency Test Statement. The impacts described in the application for development will be compared to the four (4) public facilities and services on the current Concurrency Test Statement to determine the effect on the existing levels of service. 
2.  If the most recent Concurrency Test Statement shows the proposed development will fall within an area with an unacceptable level of service for one (1) or more of the four (4) public facilities or services identified herein, a Conditional Letter of Concurrency shall be issued authorizing the development, only upon full compliance with appropriate specified provisions and measures as may be necessary to mitigate the impacts of development upon the deficient public facility or service. In the event that there are no provisions or measures which can be imposed which will reasonably mitigate the impacts of the development upon the unacceptable level of service for any one (1) or more of the four (4) public facilities and services identified herein, then the applicant will be issued a written statement denying a Letter of Concurrency. 
3.  If the proposed development identified in the application for development being reviewed: 
(a)  Has vested rights in accordance with Section 18-1610 of this Article; or 
(b)  Does not have impacts which will degrade any of the four (4) public facilities and services identified herein to an unacceptable level of service, then a Letter of Concurrency shall be issued without provisions or measures attached as conditions. 
(E)  LETTER OF CONCURRENCY-VALIDITY. 
1.  The Letter of Concurrency shall be valid for purposes of obtaining development orders or permits for twelve (12) months from date of issuance. 
2.  Any development order or permit that is issued within the effective period of an existing Letter of Concurrency shall, for purposes of concurrency only, be vested. In the event that a time extension is granted prior to the expiration of the approved development order or approved development permit, then the Letter of Concurrency for the approved development shall be automatically renewed for the length of time of the extension. 
3.  In the event that the development plan for a site changes, relative to an increase in gross floor area or change in use, within the effective period of an existing Letter of Concurrency, the existing Letter of Concurrency will be reviewed for the incremental change. The incremental change will require a complete review for impact upon the four (4) public facilities and services. A concurrency determination will then be made for the incremental change. 
4.  For those Letter of Concurrency issued for a development order issued by the City of Pinellas Park, pursuant to the provisions of F.S. §§ 163.3220-163.3243, as amended, the duration of such Letter of Concurrency, as issued, shall be for the time period stated within the development order. 
5.  The burden of showing compliance with concurrency standards and requirements shall be upon the applicant. The applicant, at his or her expense, shall provide whatever documentation and information is necessary for the City to make a determination. 
6.  The concurrency determination shall be made prior to the issuance of a development permit or order. 
(F)  DEVELOPMENT ORDER OR DEVELOPMENT PERMIT COMPLIANCE. All development orders and development permits issued and approved after the effective date of this Article shall be based upon and be in compliance with the Letter of Concurrency issued for that development proposal. A development order or development permit shall be deemed in compliance with its underlying Letter of Concurrency only if such development order or development permit is consistent therewith. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1605. - CONCURRENCY TEST STATEMENT AND MONITORING SYSTEM. 
(A)  On October 1 of each year the City Manager or his designee shall establish an annual Concurrency Test Statement, which is consistent with the provisions of this Article. 
(B)  The City Manager or his designee shall establish and maintain a Concurrency Management Monitoring System for the purposes of monitoring the status of public facilities and services and for establishing concurrency test statements. 
(C)  The remaining capacity reported for each public facility and service on the annual Concurrency Test Statement should be determined by using calculations from the Concurrency Management Monitoring System data base for existing development and for committed development of multi-year, phased development proposals or projects (including Developments of Regional Impact, Development Orders, etc.). These calculations are to be based upon an acceptable projection for the progress of each proposal or project, population growth projections, and/or such other considerations as are consistent with sound planning principles and practices. 
(D)  Nothing herein precludes the periodic establishment of amendments to the current Concurrency Test Statement if updating or correction is deemed necessary, for any reason, including, but not limited to, the following: errors in information are noted; the impact of issued development orders or permits, as monitored by the City Manager or his designee, indicate an unacceptable degradation of an adopted level of service; or changes in the status of capital improvement projects impact the underlying assumptions of the current Concurrency Test Statement. 
(E)  Under no circumstances will an amended Concurrency Test Statement divest those rights acquired, pursuant to Section 18-1604(D), under the Concurrency Test Statement as it existed prior to amendment, except where a divestiture of such rights is determined by the City Manager or his designee to be essential to prevent injury to the health, safety or welfare of the general public. 
(F)  In determining the availability of services or facilities, the City of Pinellas Park shall approve, if requested by the applicant, developments in stages or phases so that facilities and services needed for each such phase or stage will be available in accordance with the standards required by Section 18-1604(C)1 of this Article. 
Sec. 18-1606. - INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACT AREA. 
(A)  An impact area for potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, and solid waste shall include all lands, all or any portion of which are located within the service area of such facility or service as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  Provisions and measures which may be attached to Letters of Concurrency that will apply in impact areas include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Project phasing. A project may be divided into logical phases of development by area, with approval for certain phases of the development being withheld until the needed facilities are in place. 
2.  An enforceable development agreement in a form acceptable to the City of Pinellas Park which may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes. 
3.  Requirements that the necessary facilities be in place at the time the impacts of development occur. 
Any failure to comply with any such provisions or measures shall constitute a violation of the Letter of Concurrency. Upon a determination by the City of such a violation and upon written notice thereof to the applicant, then the Letter of Concurrency and all related development permits shall be revoked. 
(C)  An applicant who wishes to appeal any or all provisions or measures imposed by the City of Pinellas Park pursuant to this Section may file an appeal before the Concurrency Management Panel. The appeals procedure is set forth in Section 18-1609 of this Article. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1607. - RECOGNITION OF ESTABLISHED LEVELS OF SERVICE. 
    The City of Pinellas Park shall recognize those adopted levels of service, as defined in its comprehensive plan, as stated below: 
(A)  DRAINAGE. The Concurrency Management System will require that all applicable federal, state and local regulations be adhered to by the applicant in drainage design, including but not limited to Chapters 40D-4 and 40D-40, F.A.C.; Pinellas Park Land Development Code; and the Pinellas Park Drainage Element. 
The Drainage Code of the City of Pinellas Park, Florida, dictates that new drainage systems including pipelines, detention/retention basins and other appurtenances be sized on the basis of a twenty-five-year/twenty-four-hour storm for drainage basins greater than one (1) square mile and a ten-year/twenty-four-hour storm for smaller basins. These requirements correspond to a Service Level A. Development occurring in service area of existing drainage systems including pipelines, detention/retention basin and other appurtenances, shall comply with the applicable requirement of Article 2, Drainage Code of the Land Development Code. 
A classification system based on four (4) levels of protection has been developed. The flood level designations A, B, C and D correspond to the following: 
Service Level A. This is the most advanced level of service providing complete removal of water from streets during the designated rainfall event. All stormwater is captured by the collection system eliminating street storage systems. Significant ponding does not occur and the health and safety concerns associated with minor flooding such as exposure to sewage, transportation hazards and vehicular flooding are eliminated. 
Service Level B. This level of service allows some flooding of streets during the designated rainfall event with minor flooding of some yards but prevents significant levels of yard flooding. The flooding occurs from the overland flow of off-site stormwater surcharging the collection system and ponding in confined areas. The primary impacts of this service level are nuisance flooding of streets making them temporarily impassable. Flooding is of a limited duration. Major roadways may have some standing water in some lanes but travel in the lanes is not restricted. Yard flooding is limited to areas away from structures. 
Service Level C. This is the minimum level of service that provides protection from flooding of structures. Flooding is caused by surcharging stormwater systems with runoff and ponding in low lying areas. Minor streets may be impassable for periods of time and major roads have reduced travel ability due to flood related lane closure. Yards are flooded up to the face of the structure however no inundation of structures occurs. 
Service Level D. Major flooding is caused by the inability of storm drainage systems to remove run off under this level of service. Streets, yards and structures all receive some level of flood damage and some major traffic arteries become impassable. Evacuation of some areas for health reasons may be necessary. 
It should be noted that these levels of service only refer to the performance of drainage systems. Flooding caused by streams topping their banks due to abnormal influences such as ditch blockages or tidal surges are not addressed. The level of service standard must be related to a designated rainfall frequency event such as a twenty-five-year/twenty-four-hour storm. 
(B)  SOLID WASTE AND RESOURCE RECOVERY. The Concurrency Management System will utilize disposal of one and three-tenths (1.30) tons of solid waste per person per year and maintenance of twice weekly garbage pick up and once weekly recycling pick up for residential accounts and on an as needed basis for commercial accounts. 
(C)  WATER SUPPLY. For water supply, the Concurrency Management System will recognize the criteria associated with the agreement between Pinellas County ("County") and the City of Pinellas Park ("City"), wherein the County agrees to furnish the City up to five million (5,000,000) gallons per day ("MGD") yearly average of water for its use and redistribution in its water service area. The Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan has identified the impact of development upon the potable water system for residential uses as sixty (60) gallons/person/day and nonresidential uses as thirty (30) gallons per day per employee. As identified in the Pinellas County Comprehensive Plan, assurances are given whereby the Pinellas County Water Demand Planning Area will provide a level of service of one hundred twenty (120) gallons per capita per day (gpcpd) on an annual average. 
(D)  SANITARY SEWER. The Concurrency Management System will recognize the "Agreement for Wastewater Transmission, Treatment and Disposal Services Between Pinellas County ("County") and the City of Pinellas Park ("City")". The County treats City wastewater at its South Cross Bayou plant which has a twenty-two (22) MGD average daily flow subject to a capacity of thirty-three (33) MGD. The Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan has identified the impact of residential development upon the wastewater system as one hundred (100) gallons/day/person and nonresidential development as one thousand (1,000) gallons per day per acre. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1608. - INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION. 
(A)  The City, as the provider of public facilities or services to development within other governmental jurisdictions shall provide such facilities or services in accordance with the policies included in its Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)  Development within the City which receives public facilities or services from other governmental entities shall recognize the level of service established by such entities in accordance with the policies of the City of Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1609. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT PANEL. 
(A)  There is hereby established a City of Pinellas Park Concurrency Management Panel which shall consist of the regular members of the Board of Adjustment. 
Upon the request of the Chairperson of the Concurrency Management Panel, an alternate member of the Board of Adjustment shall act in place of a regular member who is temporarily absent, and when acting, shall have the full power of a regular member. 
(B)  Hearings before the Concurrency Management Panel shall be conducted in the following manner: 
1.  The applicant shall present such evidence as he or she may wish to offer in support of his or her position. One (1) or more full time City employees designated by the City Manager shall then present evidence in opposition. 
2.  The parties may then offer rebuttal evidence. 
3.  The Panel Members shall have the right of query after each witness or at any other time any Panel Member deems it necessary, and any Panel Member may examine and ask questions about any other evidence offered. 
4.  After such rebuttal, the parties may present closing arguments after which presentations shall cease and the Panel shall analyze the evidence so presented. 
5.  After such analysis, the panel shall render a judgment within the time frame set forth in this Article. 
The Concurrency Management Panel shall adopt such additional rules as it deems necessary and proper to the conduct of its affairs. Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such times as the Concurrency Management Panel may determine. 
(C)  The Zoning Division shall receive, file, and transmit to the Concurrency Management Panel all appeals applications, vested rights determinations, and other matters on which the Concurrency Management Panel is authorized to act under the provisions of this Article. 
(Ord. No. 3982, § 1, 5-12-2016) 
Sec. 18-1610. - VESTED RIGHTS. 
(A)  VESTED DEVELOPMENTS. The following proposed developments shall be exempt from the requirements of the Concurrency Management System, but not other applicable requirements, for the time limits specified herein: 
1.  Each phase within a phased development, which has been authorized pursuant to an approved final site plan and an approved construction schedule shall remain vested for the period of time established in the approved construction schedule. In the event that the applicant fails to complete the development of any phase as required thereby, then that phase and all subsequent phases shall no longer be vested. 
2.  A development order for a Development of Regional Impact which has been issued on or before May 31, 1990, shall remain vested for the period of time specified in the original Development Order. 
3.  An annexation agreement in effect on or before May 31, 1990, which by its express terms and not by implication shall provide vested rights for the development of the parcel which is the subject thereof as specified therein. Such rights shall remain vested for the period of time specified in the annexation agreement. 
(B)  RIGHTS VESTED BY THE DOCTRINE OF EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL. A proposed development may proceed, even if deemed inconsistent with the City of Pinellas Park Comprehensive Plan, if the City finds through a determination as described below that the owner or his representative has proven that: 
1.  He or she acted in good faith and in reasonable reliance; 
2.  Upon some act of the City; and 
3.  Has made such a substantial change in position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to destroy the rights he or she has acquired. 
(C)  VESTED RIGHTS DETERMINATION PROCESS. 
1.  Any applicant may, simultaneously with the submission of his or her application, submit a written request to the City Manager or his designee for a determination as to vested rights status of the proposed development under Paragraphs (A) or (B) of this Section. The written request shall be accompanied by any information and documentation which may be required by the City Manager or his designee. If additional information and documentation is necessary for this purpose, the City Manager or his designee may thereafter require the applicant to submit the same. The City Manager or his designee, shall within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the written request for a determination of vested rights status from the developer, issue a written determination to the applicant. 
2.  Any applicant who requests a vested rights determination by the Concurrency Management Panel under Section 18-1609 shall do so in writing within thirty (30) days of issuance of written notification from staff that the development is not entitled to vested rights status. Requests must include a thorough description of the property or project which is the subject of the application, and the documents and/or a summary of the testimony which the applicant maintains will establish such vested rights. Each filing must be accompanied by an application fee in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
3.  The vested rights determination shall be made at a hearing conducted by the Concurrency Management Panel. The Concurrency Management Panel may request technical or other information/assistance from the applicant or various City departments during the determination process. The Concurrency Management Panel shall rely on Florida law to determine whether an applicant has established an entitlement to vested rights status. If authorized by the City, the Concurrency Management Panel may request the appearance of independent consultants and/or expert witnesses. The Concurrency Management Panel may request the appearance of appropriate City staff at the vested rights determination hearing. 
4.  Vested rights determination hearings shall be held within ninety (90) days of the date the request is filed with the Zoning Division and notice of such hearing shall be sent to the applicant within five (5) days of the hearing. If necessary, by a majority vote of the Panel, the Panel may continue any petition or case before it to a subsequent hearing. 
5.  Within twenty-one (21) days after the applicant's vested rights determination hearing, the City shall make available to the public and to the applicant, in writing, the decision of the Concurrency Management Panel. Such decision shall be released through the Zoning Division and shall constitute final governmental action. Judicial review of any decision of the Concurrency Management Panel shall be by Certiorari in the Circuit Court of Pinellas County, Florida. 
6.  In order for the applicant to overturn in whole or in part the denial of vested rights by staff, the applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was no substantial competent evidence to support the denial of vested rights. 
7.  The Zoning Division shall maintain as required by law the records of all Concurrency Management Panel proceedings relating to vested rights determinations. 
8.  Before any aggrieved person may challenge a decision, determination or result made under this Section as a temporary or permanent taking of private property without just compensation, he or she must exhaust the provisions of this Section and any other applicable subsequently enacted administrative procedures before any action on a request for development is deemed to be final.

Sec. 18-1704.2. - FINANCING OF TRUST FUNDS. 
(A)  Each taxing authority shall pay into the Trust Fund an amount not less than the increment in the income, proceeds, revenues and funds of each taxing authority derived from or held in connection with the Redevelopment Area, and the Pinellas Park Community Redevelopment Agency's undertaking and carrying out of the Community Redevelopment projects therein.

1.  The amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by each taxing authority, exclusive of any amount from any debt service millage, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the Redevelopment Area; and 
2.  The amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the taxes levied each year by or for each taxing authority, exclusive of any debt service millage, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable property in the Redevelopment Area as shown upon the most recent assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by each taxing authority prior to October 1, 1997. 
In calculating the increment, the amount of the ad valorem taxes levied based on the City-wide debt service on City bonds shall be totally excluded from the calculation and shall continue to be used for their voter approved purpose and shall not be appropriated to the Trust Fund. Any adjustments made in the appropriation will be based upon the final extended tax roll. 
(B)  Each taxing authority shall annually pay to the Trust Fund the tax increment (as herein defined) due the trust by January 1 of each year. Any taxing authority which does not pay the increment to the Trust Fund by January 1 shall pay to the Trust Fund an additional amount equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the increment and shall also pay interest on the amount of the increment equal to one percent (1%) for each month the increment is outstanding. 
(C)  As used herein "taxing authority" shall have the same meaning as that contained in Florida Statute § 163.340 as amended from time to time.

In addition to those powers and duties set forth under Chapter 163, Part III, Florida Statutes, as delegated by the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners by Resolution No. 88-469 and accepted by the City under Resolution No. 88-76, the following regulations shall constitute the powers and duties of the Community Redevelopment Agency. These regulations shall apply to, and be limited to, all property located within the Community Redevelopment Area zoned or proposed to be rezoned to "MXD" Mixed Use District or "TC" Town Center District. 
PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL. All development proposed for the Community Redevelopment District shall require the approval of a site plan by the Community Redevelopment Agency with review and recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the developer is seeking density or intensity bonuses consistent with the bonus guidelines provided for each district, the Community Redevelopment Agency shall provide notice and conduct a public hearing as provided in Section 18-1534 to consider the site plan. 
1.  TIME EXTENSIONS. If the time frames set forth for Conditional Uses, Variances and Site Plan Approval cannot be met, the holder of the Conditional Use, Variance or approved Site Plan may request only one (1) time extension of a maximum of one (1) additional year from the Community Development Administrator or a designee. 
(a)  An application for a Conditional Use, Variance or Site Plan Approval time extension shall be submitted to the Zoning Division. The application shall include the initially approved application and all materials originally required for the Conditional Use, Variance or Site Plan Approval, as well as a letter of explanation as to the circumstances necessitating such time extension, and the applicable fee. 
(b)  An application for a time extension shall be filed no later than thirty-five (35) days prior to the expiration date of the Conditional Use, Variance or approved Site Plan. 
(c)  The Community Development Administrator or a designee may approve, approve with additional conditions, or deny a request for time extension. The Community Development Administrator or a designee shall review the previously approved Conditional Use, Variance or approved Site Plan, the conditions and safeguards imposed in connection with its prior approval, and make a determination on whether the Conditional Use, Variance or Site Plan Approval still satisfies the applicable Conditional Use, Variance or Site Plan Approval requirements and other Land Development Code standards. Additionally, all regulations in effect at the time the application for the time extension are considered by the Community Development Administrator or a designee shall apply and be considered in deciding the request for time extension. 
(d)  An applicant whose time extension has been approved with additional conditions, where such additional conditions are felt unwarranted or present a hardship, or whose time extension has been denied may appeal such decision of the Community Development Administrator or designee to the Community Redevelopment Agency. An appeal shall be filed with the Zoning Division within a reasonable time not to exceed sixty (60) days of the date of the Community Development Administrator's or designee's decision, paying the fee as required by the applicable fee schedule. Such appeal shall specify the grounds therefore. 
2.  APPEALS OF COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY DECISIONS. The City, applicant or property owner, or property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property who received or should have received a public hearing notice, aggrieved by the decision of the Community Redevelopment Agency may appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner provided by law.

The applicant shall provide notice, by certified mail/return receipt requested, to all owners of property abutting the right-of-way or easement to be vacated, notifying said abutting property owners that the applicant has applied for the vacation of a right-of-way or easement and enclosing a copy of the application. The applicant shall provide documentation to the City that he has complied with the notice requirements herein. If the applicant is the sole owner of all abutting property, such proof shall not be required. In the event the certified notice has been refused or not retrieved by an abutting property owner, the applicant shall provide documentation thereof and shall send the notice to the said property owner by U.S. Mail. (Ord. No. 2321, 3-23-1995)

(C)  The City may notify affected City divisions and departments of the application for vacation and request recommendations. The various reviewing divisions and departments shall review the request for vacation and provide recommendations to the City.

In the review of the application for a right-of-way, the City shall assess whether or not all or part of the right-of-way should be retained or converted to an easement. In reviewing the request for the vacation of an easement, the City shall assess whether or not all or part of the easement should be retained. (Ord. No. 2321, 3-23-1995)
