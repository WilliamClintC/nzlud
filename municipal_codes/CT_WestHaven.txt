Part II: General Legislation
Chapter 64. Adult-Oriented Establishments
[HISTORY: Adopted by the City Council of the City of West Haven 9-9-1996 by Ord. No. 360.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
§ 64-1. Policy; findings; purpose.
There are or may be adult-oriented establishments located in the City of West Haven ("city") which
will require special supervision from the city's public safety agencies in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the
health, safety and welfare of the city's citizens. This is so because such businesses may and do
generate secondary effects which are detrimental to neighborhoods.
Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States
indicate that:
Large numbers of persons frequent such adult-oriented establishments, especially those
which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for private viewing of so-called
"adult" motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment.
Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or
customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual
acts.
Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to
provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such
booths, cubicles and rooms.
Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of
such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles,
studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and
rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes and others, thereby promoting and
encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and
urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms,
which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may
come into contact with such deposits.
The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tends to
discourage such sexual acts and prostitution and thereby promotes the health, safety and
welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments.
The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments, including without limitation
those specifically cited at Subsection A of this chapter, is and would be detrimental to the general

welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the city.
The Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the city powers, and in particular
police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adultoriented
establishments as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
It is not the intent of the City Council, in enacting this chapter, to deny to any person rights to
speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the Board
to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, video tapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting
this chapter, the City Council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain
and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or State
Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that
distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit
such materials.

one consecutive inspection report, the Director of Health may immediately issue a written notice to
the permit holder, or person in charge, citing such conditions, specifying the corrective action to be
taken and time frame within which action shall be taken. If correction is not made in the allotted
time, the permit may be revoked or suspended.
The Director of Health may suspend, without warning, prior notice or hearing, any permit to
operate a barbershop or hairdressing and/or cosmetology shop:
If the operation constitutes an imminent hazard to public health; or

resume has been issued by the Director of Health. The Director of Health shall remove the
suspended permit from the premises.

Police Department  See Ch. 36.

entertainment or accommodation of the general public. It shall also include the front or immediate
area of such premises.
REMAIN
To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of
groups (or an interacting of minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved
would not be using the streets for ordinary serious purposes, such as mere passage or going
home. To implement that thought with additional precision or precaution, numerous exceptions are
expressly defined in § 86-3 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence-type curfew chapter.
§ 86-3. Violations of curfew.
It shall be unlawful for any minor to remain, idle, wander, stroll or be in any public place, either on foot
or in a vehicle, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. unless accompanied by a parent or a
duly authorized custodian, except that a minor may be in a public place under the following
circumstances:
While returning home by a direct route and within a reasonable time following the termination of a
special function or activity conducted by a school, church, club or recreational or other
organization sponsoring a function or activity for minors.
While on an emergency errand or specific business or activity directed or permitted by the parent
of such minor.
While returning home by a direct route and within a reasonable time of leaving a place where such
minor is employed.
While attending or traveling directly to or from an activity involving the exercise of first amendment
rights of free speech, freedom of assembly or free exercise of religion.
When a minor, with parental consent, is in a motor vehicle engaged in bona fide interstate or
intrastate travel.
When a minor is on the property or the sidewalk directly adjacent to where such minor resides or
the property immediately adjacent thereto if the owner of the adjacent property does not
communicate an objection to the minor or the police officer.
§ 86-4. Parental responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for the parent of a minor to knowingly permit or by insufficient control to allow a
minor to be or remain in a public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to or
otherwise beyond the scope of this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in the legal custody of
the parent.
§ 86-5. Police procedures.
A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in violation of this chapter shall:
Ascertain the name of the minor.
Verbally warn the minor that the minor is in violation of this chapter.
Order the minor to go promptly home by a direct route.
11/3/2019 City of West Haven, CT

E.
If a minor does not heed the order of the police officer to return home or, if in the judgment of the
police officer, based on the age of the minor or other attendant circumstances, it would be in the
best interests of such minor, the police officer shall transport such minor to his or her home. The
police officer shall advise the parent of such minor that such minor is in violation of this chapter
and shall issue a warning to the parent of such minor that any subsequent violation will result in a
full enforcement of this chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and applicable
penalties.
Not withstanding Subsection A of this section, a police officer who has probable cause to believe
that the minor is in violation of this chapter shall transport the minor to the Police Department if the
police officer has reasonable cause to believe that the minor has engaged in delinquent conduct.
When a minor is taken to the Police Department, the minor's parent shall be immediately
contacted and requested to come to the Police Department to pick up the minor. The police officer
shall advise the parent that the minor is in violation of this chapter and shall issue a warning to the
parent that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this chapter, including
enforcement of parental responsibility and applicable penalties. If the parent is unavailable or
unable to pick up the minor, the police officer shall transport the minor home or turn said minor
over to the custody of the appropriate juvenile authorities.
If the police officer is unable to advise the parent of the violation of this chapter and/or to issue the
warning as set forth in Subsection B or D of this section in person, the Chief of Police or his/her
designee shall send a certified letter to the parent of such minor advising such parent of the
violation and including a warning with respect to any subsequent violations.
§ 86-6. Penalties for offenses.
Inasmuch as the primary intent of this chapter is to assure that minors are provided with appropriate
parental supervision for their own protection and for the protection of the community, the penalties for
violations are intended to be corrective rather than punitive in nature. Accordingly, if, after a warning
notice pursuant to § 86-5, a parent of a minor violates § 86-4 of this chapter with a second violation by
such minor, the Youth Bureau of the Police Department shall made a referral to the appropriate
juvenile authorities of the State of Connecticut for an investigation with respect to whether said minor is
beyond the control of his/her parent or neglected.
§ 86-7. Severability.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this chapter. If any provision, including,
inter alia, any exception, part, phrase or term of the application to any person or circumstances, is held
to be invalid, the other provisions or the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby.

§ 97-3. Officers; rules for conduct.
Members of the Commission shall elect a Chairman and a Secretary for a period of one year. The
Commission shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of business within its
jurisdiction and shall keep a record of all its proceedings. The Commission may, in its discretion,
appoint an Executive Director.
§ 97-4. Powers.
The Commission shall have the power to make studies and investigations, conduct hearings and
receive complaints relative to rental charges on housing accommodations, except those
accommodations rented on a seasonal basis, within the City of West Haven in order to control or
eliminate excessive rent charges on such accommodations and carry out the provisions of this
chapter. The Commission, for such purposes, may compel the attendance of persons at hearings,
issue subpoenas and administer oaths, issue orders and continue, review, amend, terminate or
suspend any of its orders and decisions. [NOTE: For purposes of this subsection, "seasonal basis"
means housing accommodations rented for a period or periods aggregating not more than 120
days in any one calendar year.]
The Commission may attempt, through the process of informal conciliation and negotiation
between a complaining tenant and landlord, to arrive at a rental agreement which is mutually
acceptable to said tenant and landlord before initiating the formal hearing process. No formal or
informal hearing shall be held less than 10 days from the mailing date of a notice of such hearing
to the landlord or an agent of such landlord, at which he may be represented by counsel.
The designated members of the Commission shall have the power to meet with the parties, if the
parties consent, on an informal basis in a session closed to the public to attempt to reconcile the
differences between the parties but shall receive no formal evidence nor make any decision
thereon. Any agreement between the parties as a result of said informal conference must be in
writing and fully enforceable by the Commission. The informal meeting shall be conducted by two
members of the Commission appointed by the Chairman. The Commission members so assigned
shall take no part at a formal hearing, if any, thereafter held on the case.
§ 97-5. Authority to order rent reductions.
If the Commission determines, after a hearing, that rent charges for any housing accommodations
are so excessive, based on the standards and criteria set forth in Subsection B of this section, as
to be harsh and unconscionable, it may order a reduction in rent to such amount as it determines
to be fair and equitable. If the Commission determines, after a hearing, that the housing
accommodations in question fail to comply with any municipal ordinance or state statute or
regulations relating to health and safety, it may order the suspension of further payment of rent by
the tenant until such time as the landlord makes the necessary changes, repairs or installations so
as to bring such housing accommodation into compliance with such ordinance, statute or
regulation. The rent during said period shall be paid to the Commission to be held in escrow.
In making determinations as to whether a rental charge is excessive, the Commission shall give
due consideration to the following:
Rent charged for the same number of rooms in other housing accommodations in the same
and in other areas in the city.
The sanitary conditions existing in the housing accommodations in question.
The income of the tenant and the availability of other accommodations.

The Commission shall not have the power to make any rent reduction retroactive. Any rent reduction
shall become effective on the next due date of the rent following the Commission decision.
§ 97-7. Penalties for offenses.
Any person who violates any order of rent reduction or rent suspension by demanding, accepting or
receiving an amount in excess thereof while such other remains in effect and no appeal pursuant to
§ 97-8 is pending or who violates any other provision of this chapter and Section 47a-20 of the
Connecticut General Statutes or who refuses to obey any subpoena, order or decision of the
Commission pursuant thereto may be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100 for each offense. If
such offense continues for more than five days, it shall constitute a new offense for each day it
continues to exist thereafter. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and enforce all matters
relating to violations under said sections.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 97-8. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by any order of the Commission may appeal to the Housing Court for the
Judicial District of New Haven. As provided by the Connecticut General Statutes, such appeal shall be
considered as a privileged matter with respect to the order of trial. Such appeal shall be limited to the
question of whether the Commission acted arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. Unless
otherwise directed by the Commission or the Court, the filing of an appeal shall not stay any order
issued by the Commission.
§ 97-9. Retaliatory action by landlord.
No landlord shall maintain an action or proceeding against a tenant to recover possession of a dwelling
unit, demand an increase in rent from the tenant or decrease the services to which the tenant has been
entitled within six months after the tenant has in good faith filed a complaint with the West Haven Fair
Rent Commission. The tenant shall continue to pay the amount of rent in effect of the claim of
retaliatory action.

§ 111-1. Findings.
The flood areas of the City of West Haven are subject to periodic inundation which can result in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by shoreline flood hazard areas subjected to periodic tidal and
storm flooding and the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood
heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected
from flood damages.
§ 111-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or
erosion or to flood heights or velocities.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
§ 111-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
Protect human life and health.
Minimize future expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects.
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public.
Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric and
telephone lines, streets and bridges, located in floodplains.
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas.
Make potential home buyers aware that their property is in a flood area.

Chapter 128. Enforcement of Ordinances
[HISTORY: Adopted by the City Council of the City of West Haven 7-24-1995 by Ord. No. 348.
Amendments noted where applicable.]
Article I. Non-Zoning Violations
§ 128-1. Legislative authority.
Pursuant to Sections 7-148(c)(10)(A) and 7-152c of the Connecticut General Statutes, as such
sections may be amended from time to time, the City of West Haven (the City) hereby adopts the
following procedure for citations issued for violations of town ordinances.
§ 128-2. Enforcement by citation.
[Amended 5-29-2003]
Unless otherwise specifically provided in a City ordinance or the Connecticut General Statutes, all City
ordinances may be enforced by citations issued by municipal officers or employees designated by the
Mayor. Such designated municipal officers or employees may issue a written warning providing notice
of the specific violation before issuing the citation.
§ 128-3. Appointment of hearing officers.
The Mayor shall appoint one or more persons who shall serve as hearing officers to conduct hearings
into the violation of City ordinances. The hearing officers shall be electors of the town, but no police
officer or any employee or person authorized to issue citations for the violations of any City ordinance
shall be permitted to serve as a hearing officer.
§ 128-4. Notice of violation.
Within 12 months from the expiration of the period for the uncontested payment of fines, penalties,
costs or fees for any citation issued under any town ordinance for a violation thereof, the town shall
send notice to the owner of the property which is the subject of the violation or such other person as
may be appropriate (the "cited person"). Such notice shall inform the cited person:
Of the allegations against the cited person and the amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees
due;

D.
That the cited person may contest liability before a hearing officer by delivering in person or by
mail written notice within 10 days of the date thereof;
That if a hearing is not demanded, an assessment and judgment shall be entered against the cited
person; and
That such judgment may issue without further notice.
§ 128-5. Admission of liability.
[Amended 6-26-2006]
If a cited person who is sent notice pursuant to § 128-4 wishes to admit liability for an alleged violation,
the cited person may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or
fees in person or by mail to the City at the address specified in the notice. Such payment shall be
inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of the cited person or other
person making the payment. Any cited person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a
hearing within 10 days of the date of the notice provided for in § 128-4 shall be deemed to have
admitted liability, and the issuing official shall certify the cited person's failure to respond to the hearing
officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees provided
for by the applicable ordinance and shall follow the procedures set forth in § 128-6 below.
§ 128-6. Hearing procedure.
Any cited person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for
the hearing. The hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of
the mailing of the notice, provided that the hearing officer shall grant, upon good cause shown, any
reasonable request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified
copy of the initial notice of violation, issued by the issuing official or police officer shall be filed and
retained by the town and shall be deemed to be a business record within the scope of Section 52-180
of the Connecticut General Statutes and evidence of the facts contained therein. The hearing officer
shall conduct a hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as the hearing officer
deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly
applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce a
decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the cited person is not liable,
then the matter shall be dismissed and the hearing officer's determination shall be entered in writing
accordingly. If the cited person is found liable for the violation, the hearing officer shall forthwith enter
and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against the cited person as provided by the applicable
ordinance.
§ 128-7. Attendance at hearing.
The presence of the issuing official or police officer shall be required at the hearing if the cited person
so requests. A designated town official, other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf
of the town. The cited person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing and may present
evidence in his or her behalf. The hearing officer may, however, accept from the cited person copies of
police reports, investigatory and citation reports and other official documents by mail and may
determine thereby that the appearance of the cited person at the hearing is unnecessary. If the cited
person fails to appear and such appearance has not been determined by the hearing officer to be
unnecessary, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against the cited person upon a
finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable ordinance.
§ 128-8. Notice of assessment; judgment.

A.
B.
C.
If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail
a notice of the assessment to the cited person and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more than 12
months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the Clerk of the Superior
Court at Milford together with such entry fee as may be required by the Superior Court. The certified
copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelve-month
period, assessments against the same cited person may be accrued and filed as one record of
assessment. The Clerk shall enter judgment, in the amount of such record of assessment and court
costs, against the cited person in favor of the town. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Connecticut General Statutes, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall
have the effect of a civil money judgment, and a levy of execution of such judgment may issue without
further notice to the cited person.
§ 128-9. Appeals.
A cited person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this chapter is entitled to
judicial review by way of appeal. Any appeal shall be instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice
of such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together with an entry fee in an amount
equal to the entry fee for a small claims case pursuant to Section 52-259 of the Connecticut General
Statutes, in the Superior Court at Milford, which shall entitle the cited person to a hearing in
accordance with the rules of the judges of the Superior Court.
Article II. Zoning Violations

fine for each violation shall be $100 for each day that such violation continues. Citations shall be
issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his/her agent by hand or by delivery to the abode or
residence of the person in violation.

Upon the issuance of a citation by the Zoning Enforcement Officer or his/her agent, the time period for
correction of the violation cited in such citation shall be in accordance with the following requirements:
For violations that involve the illegal use of a property by a nonstructural object such as a sign,
vehicle, junk, etc., compliance with the regulations shall be within 48 hours of issuance of the
citation.
For violations that involve the illegal use of a property by the conduct of an activity which is not
permitted, compliance with the regulations shall be within 48 hours of issuance of the citation.
For violations that involve the illegal placement of a structure, all work on the structure shall

shall reinspect to confirm compliance within 24 hours of such report.

equipment based on minimum requirements for safety to life and property from fire. They cover
the installation and repair of oil burners and all equipment connected thereto, including tanks,

renewed which has expired for a period of more than 30 days; it shall be processed as a new
application.
Under this section, there shall be two classes of licenses issued:
Class 1: a license to install oil-burning equipment

maintaining such equipment requiring such equipment to be repaired or altered so as to remove such
dangerous condition. In case of failure of said person or persons to comply fully with such
requirements in five days after notice shall have been served, or immediately in cases of imminent
danger, said Fire Marshal shall have the power to order and compel the discontinuance of said
equipment until such time as the same has been made safe in his judgment.

inches above the top of the sewer pipe and at least 12 inches from the side of the sewer trench.
All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work, unless
otherwise approved by the Superintendent. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within
three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth of the building sewer
shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and, in general, such depth shall not be less than
three feet below the finished ground surface at all points. All building sewers shall be laid at
uniform grade of not less than one foot per 100 feet and in straight alignment insofar as possible.
Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Any changes in
direction exceeding a forty-five-degree angle shall require a cleanout brought to grade. Building
sewers shall be laid upon a bedding of crushed stone on firm undisturbed soil or a suitable
foundation; they shall be located at a sufficient distance from other parallel pipes to permit
alterations or repairs to any such pipes or the building sewer pipe without disturbing the other;
they shall be well cleaned inside after laying; and they shall conform to all reasonable
requirements for good construction.
Backfill placed over building sewers shall be done with hand tools to a depth of at least one foot
over the pipe, using fine sand free from stones and debris. Backfill shall be well and carefully
tamped over the sewer.
The open ends of building sewers, building drains and building connection laterals shall be kept
closed and protected during construction and during periods when work is suspended in order to
exclude from the public sewer all water or debris which might obstruct, damage or otherwise be
detrimental to the public sewer or the sewage collection system. Abandoned building sewers or
drains shall be likewise promptly closed and sealed off from any public sewer at the expense of
the owner of the property.
§ 191-22. Types of joints and connections.
All joints and connections for or between building sewers, building drains and building connection
laterals already connected to the public sewer shall conform to the latest ASTM standard specification
for the type of building sewer pipe being installed, altered or repaired. All joints and connections shall
be flexible and watertight to prevent infiltration and root intrusion. When connecting building sewer
pipes of different types and/or sizes, elastomeric plastic push-on compression joint sealers (donuts) or
couplings with stainless-steel tightening bands shall be utilized. No rigid joints such as cement mortar
are permitted.
§ 191-23. Connection between building sewer and public sewer.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the wye or tee branch,
if such branch is available, at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or
less and no properly located wye or tee branch is available, the owner shall, at his expense, install
a wye or tee fitting in the public sewer at the location specified by the Superintendent. The wye or
tee fitting shall be connected into the public sewer with the appropriate-sized elastomeric plastic
coupling with four stainless-steel tightening bands. Where public sewers are asbestos-cement
sewer pipe, the connection may be made with a cast-iron saddle with rubber gaskets and stainless
steel straps in the event that no branch is available on the public sewer. Where the public sewer is
greater than 12 inches in diameter and no properly located wye or tee branch is available, a neat
hole may be cut in the public sewer to receive the building sewer with entry in the downstream
direction at an angle of about 45°. A forty-five-degree ell may be used to make such connection
with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of
the building sewer at the point of connection with public sewers greater than 12 inches in diameter
shall be at an elevation equal to the springline (sewer pipe center-line elevation) or higher. A
smooth, neat joint shall be made and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement

in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the
Superintendent. A manhole to be constructed at the connection to the public sewer may be
required for building sewers greater than six inches in diameter or when required by the
Superintendent.
The connection of a building sewer into the public sewer may be permitted at and into an existing
manhole at the discretion of the Superintendent. Manhole connections shall be made with
watertight and flexible elastomeric plastic concrete manhole adaptors (waterstops) which shall be
installed by coring a hole into the manhole wall and filling around the installed adaptor with cement
mortar.

No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater
which will interfere with the operation or performance of the WPCF. These general prohibitions apply to
all such users of a WPCF, whether or not the user is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards or any other federal or state pretreatment standards or requirements. A user shall not
contribute the following substances to any WPCF:
Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, are or may be sufficient,
either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in
any other way to the WPCF or to the operation of the WPCF. At no time shall two successive
readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the sewage collection
system or at any point in the system, be more than 5% nor any single reading over 10% of the
lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter.
Solids or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other
interference with the operation of the WPCF, including substances such as but not limited to
grease, garbage with particles greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues,
paunch, manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders,
sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent
grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining
or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
Any sewage having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other corrosive property capable of causing
damage or hazard to structures, equipment and personnel of the WPCF. The upper limit of pH for
any industrial wastewater discharge shall be established under the discharger's state discharge
permit.
Any sewage containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals or plant life, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the WPCF or
exceed the limitation set forth in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard. A toxic pollutant shall
include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
Any noxious or malodorous sewage, gases or solids which, either singly or by interaction with
other sewage, are sufficient to prevent entry into the public sewers for their maintenance and
repair.
Any sewage which, by interaction with other sewage in the public sewer, releases obnoxious
gases, forms suspended solids which interfere with the collection system or creates a condition
which may be deleterious to structures and treatment processes or which may cause the effluent
limitations of the WPCF's NPDES permit to be exceeded.
Any substance which may cause the WPCF's effluent or any other product of the WPCF, such as
residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation process where the WPCF is pursuing
a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the WPCF cause
the facility to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations
developed under Section 405 of the Act, any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use
or disposal developed pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air
Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the sludge management
method being used.
Any substance which will cause a WPCF to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality
standards.
Sewage containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the
wastewater treatment process employed or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the water pollution control facility effluent cannot meet the limits stipulated in the NPDES city's
permit.

A.
This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or
prevailing at the time of connection.
A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue.
§ 204-8. Suspension of MS4 access.
Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Department of Public Works
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or
waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to
persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharges. Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement
agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
§ 204-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a
form acceptable to the Department of Public Works prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 204-10. Monitoring of discharges.
This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges to the municipal stormwater
system, including industrial, commercial, and construction activities.
Access to facilities.
The Department of Public Works shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
Facility operators shall allow the Department of Public Works ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
The Department of Public Works shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.

expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral
request of the Department of Public Works and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing
such access shall be borne by the operator.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department of Public Works access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the
operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
If the Department of Public Works has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as
part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 204-11. Best management practices.
The Department of Public Works will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
residential, commercial or industrial (or under construction) establishment shall provide, at their
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural
and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises which is, or
may be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 204-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 204-13. Notification of spills.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or
operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any
known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the United States, said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Department of Public Works
within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 204-14. Enforcement.
Notice of violation.

set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a
contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
Fines.
The fines shall not exceed the maximum permitted under state law, and the amount shall be
determined in accordance with this subsection B.
Fine schedule. The fine for violations involving more than one activity shall be equal to the
sum of the fines for each applicable activity class.

§ 206-26. Authority of Street Excavation Inspector.
All excavations made in any public highway in said city shall be made under the direction or
supervision of the Street Excavation Inspector as the agent of the Director of Public Works.
§ 206-27. Replacement of highways; repair.
The permittee, at his own expense, shall replace the highway in as good a condition as before the
work was started and shall repair any damage caused by his activities under said permit. All repair and
replacement work shall be performed by or under the direction of the permittee and supervised by the
Street Excavation Inspector. If, in the opinion of said Inspector, the work being performed does not
meet the specifications and conditions, commencing work within 24 hours of notification to make such
correction, unless a longer period of time is allowed by the Director. In the event that said permittee
fails to properly repair or replace said highway, the Street Excavation Inspector shall order the
necessary repairs, and the permittee shall be liable for the full expense of such work.
§ 206-28. Notification; emergencies.

been given to the Street Excavation Inspector. Said Excavation Inspector may waive said notice when,
in his discretion, an emergency exists.
§ 206-29. Method of excavating; trenching; sheeting.
Excavations. The size of the excavation shall be kept as small as practicable to carry on the work.
Any permittee making an opening or excavation in a public highway paved with cement concrete,
bituminous concrete or any oiled gravel shall cut the surface of pavement with a pneumatic cutter
or its equal. The cut is to be made in as straight a line as possible for the length of the proposed
excavation and to the depth of the existing pavement. No material shall be placed so as to
interfere as little as possible with the ordinary use of the highway. If such excavated material must
be placed in drainage ditches, a suitable conduit first shall be installed temporarily in the ditch to
carry drainage beyond the obstruction. Water in a trench must not be pumped onto the pavement
or travelway.
Trenching shall proceed in accordance with latest manual on safety in construction as published
by the William Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The trench shall be an ample
width at the bottom to accommodate the structure to be placed and any work on the structure that
conditions necessitate.
Sheeting requirements for excavation to ensure the safety of personnel, the public, property or
proper installation shall be furnished and placed by the contractor in accordance with good
practice and at his own expense. Requirements and specifications for sheeting shall satisfy the
intent of the William Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
§ 206-30. Protection of excavations; closing of streets.
All excavations shall be properly protected by barricades, danger warning signs and, during the

In the event that it is necessary to excavate across the entire width of any street or highway, only
1/2 of the street or highway must be excavated at one time, and the same shall be properly
restored for safe passing of vehicular traffic before the remaining 1/2 of the street is excavated.
In the event of any emergency when it shall become necessary to close the entire street or
highway, the Police Department and Fire Department shall be notified at once of the action to
close the street or highway.
§ 206-31. Backfilling.
Backfilling and paving shall take place only in the presence of the Street Excavation Inspector or
his deputy.
The backfilling of excavations in city highways shall be performed so that the least possible
settling will occur. The excavation shall be filled with suitable material and thoroughly tamped in a
layer not to exceed six inches in thickness. Acceptability of excavated material to be used in the
backfill shall be determined solely by the Street Excavation Inspector.
Tamping shall be by means of mechanical rams, vibrators, hand tamps or by pneumatic tampers.
If pneumatic tampers are used, they shall have a tampering face area of not less than 50 square
inches in area, and each complete assembly shall have a weight of not less than two pounds per
square inch. If a hand tamp is used, it shall weigh not less than 12 pounds and have a tamping
face area of not more than 50 square inches.
When approved or directed by the Street Excavation Inspector, the backfill shall be thoroughly
consolidated by flushing the excavation with water.
The top eight inches of backfill in the pavement area shall consist of processed stone and in the
shoulder area shall consist of a minimum of eight inches of processed gravel or processed stone
on top of approved bank-run gravel backfill. Unsuitable material must be removed promptly from
the site of the work by the permittee or his contractor.
Backfill around tree roots shall be placed carefully, tamped and puddled to prevent air pockets,
root damage or settlement.
§ 206-32. Temporary pavement; permanent restoration.
Temporary pavement repairs and improved shoulder repairs.
As soon as the excavations have been backfilled and tamped, the pavement shall be
replaced temporarily by the permittee. The temporary pavement shall consist of a bituminous
concrete mixture approved by the Street Excavation Inspector, compressed to a minimum
depth of two inches. The surface of the temporary pavement shall not extend above or below
the surface of the surrounding permanent pavement and shall be reasonably smooth. The
permittee shall be responsible for the temporary pavement and shall see that the contractor or
his own forces keep this pavement in repair until the permanent surface can be replaced.
Additional material shall be added, as necessary, as the backfill settles.
In any case, if the permittee does not maintain the temporary pavement adequately, the
Street Excavation Inspector will order the necessary repairs to prevent accidents, and the
permittee will be charged by the city for this work.
The licensee shall deposit with the Director of Public Works a sum of money equal to the
estimated cost of the permanent resurfacing or repaving of said public right-of-way.

A public utility company may request permission from the Director of Public Works to restore the
pavement, at its own expense, under supervision of the Director of Public Works.
§ 206-33. Period of settling prior to permanent paving.
Depending upon the character of the excavation, the depth, the kind of material used in backfilling,
the degree of compactness obtained and other conditions, the Street Excavation Inspector may
require that the temporary repair of an excavation be maintained until he is satisfied that the
settlement of the backfill material is practically completed and that the permanent repair can be
made without creating a hazard to the users of the highway. Where it appears that a long period of
time will be required to obtain adequate settlement of backfilled material, a semipermanent
surface of bituminous concrete shall be placed.
On bituminous concrete highways, a minimum depth of two inches of compacted, semipermanent
surface shall be placed when ordered by the Street Excavation Inspector, to remain until a
permanent bituminous concrete surfaced can be placed.
Upon replacement of permanent pavement, a cutback of 18 inches must be made prior to
placement of permanent pavement.
§ 206-34. Time period of permits; extensions.
All work must be completed to the satisfaction of the Street Excavation Inspector. Permits become void
30 days after the issuance of said permit. The Street Excavation Inspector can, upon request of the
permittee, grant an extension of time for what he determines to be a valid reason.
§ 206-35. Permit procedure for emergency work.
When permission has been granted orally by the Inspector to perform emergency work, such as repair
of a broken gas or water main, the person or company concerned must file a written application for a
permit within 24 hours thereafter, in the manner prescribed for a nonemergency work. Thereupon, a
written permit will be sent in confirmation of the oral permission as a permanent record of the
transaction.
§ 206-36. Permit fee.
There shall be paid to the City of West Haven an excavation permit fee in the sum of $15 for each
excavation job in any street, highway or sidewalk of the City of West Haven.
§ 206-37. Indemnification of City.
The permittee shall pay and make good all losses or damages arising out of any cause connected with
the excavations of said street and shall indemnify and save harmless the City of West Haven from any
and all claims and any and all liability or responsibility of every nature and kind for any loss, damage or
injury which any person or persons may sustain or suffer by reason of any cause connected with the
excavation of said street by the permittee.

boundaries of the City of West Haven, for the purpose of traffic control and public safety. Such

the cost of the same shall be charged directly to the permittee or company performing work. If the
Department of Police Services of the City of West Haven is unable to supply a uniformed police

person/traffic control person for all such excavations, road closings and/or constructions during the

vehicle taxes were delinquent and whose delinquency was reported to the Commissioner of Motor
Vehicles pursuant to Sec. 14-33 C.G.S., in addition to the delinquent taxes and all interest thereon, a

information requested by the Tax Assessor pursuant to § 12-63c(a) of the Connecticut General
Statutes, provided accurate information is submitted to the Tax Assessor before the waiver of the

Commissions of the City to maximize the effectiveness of the work of the Tree Commission.

authorities ascribed to him/her as set out in the Connecticut General Statutes Sections 23-58
through 23-65, as the same may be amended, and this chapter.
Duties of the Tree Warden:
Enforce all provisions of law for the preservation of trees and shrubs in the City of West
Haven.
Hire arborist/contractors for the pruning, maintenance or removal of trees or shrubs on
City property in accordance with the long-range management plan and the specifications
and standards outlined in the Forestry Management Plan.
Post a notice upon trees on City property of their planned removal at least 10 days before
removal is to take place, unless the condition of the trees constitutes an immediate public
hazard.
With the Tree Commission, select and identify any trees which qualify as landmark and
asset trees on city property and, with the concurrence of the property owner, on private
property. Prevent damage to trees and shrubs on City property by any person, company,
utility, or state or federal agency. Damage may include, but not be limited to, pruning,
removing, defacing, cutting, painting or marking trees; posting unauthorized signs on
trees; injuring, mutilating, killing or destroying any trees or shrubs; permitting any toxic
chemical, including excessive road salt or other de-icing chemical, to seep, drain, or be
emptied on or about any tree; piling soil over roots to a suffocating depth or scraping soil
above the roots; setting fires or burning rubble within the trees' root zone.
The Tree Warden recognizes the importance of the various public utility companies to
schedule tree trimming to protect their wires and prevent damage from interfering tree
branches. It is important that our residents enjoy continuity of service with minimum
interruptions caused by power failure, loss of telephone or cable service. The City of
West Haven insists that all such tree trimming is performed under the direct supervision
of a licensed arborist. All pruning cuts will be horticulturally correct and in compliance
with the standards endorsed by the National Arborist Association. It will be the
responsibility of the utility company to notify the City Tree Warden prior to removal of any
tree on City property unless such tree represents an immediate and substantial threat to

collected under this chapter, then said proposed action must be approved by a majority of the
members of the WPCC present and eligible to vote at a regular or special meeting called for that
purpose. Any proposed use of funds from either the user charge operating fund or any reserve account

WPCC.
Article III. User Charge System
§ 222-26. Determination and declaration.
It is determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the protection of the public health,
safety, welfare and convenience of the citizens of West Haven to collect charges from all users who
contribute wastewater to the West Haven wastewater treatment works. The proceeds of such charges
so derived will be used for the purpose of operating and maintaining the public wastewater treatment
works.
§ 222-27. Deposit of revenues.
The revenues collected, as a result of the user charges levied, shall be deposited in a separate
nonlapsing fund known as the "User Charge Operating Fund" as established in this chapter. Fiscal
year end balances in the operation, maintenance and replacement of the fund shall be used for no
other purposes than those designated.
§ 222-28. Rates and charges.
[Amended 12-27-1993 by Ord. No. 335]
Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City of West Haven based on his use of the
treatment works as determined by its equivalent units.
For residential users, annual user charges will be based on one-family and multiple-family houses
and buildings. One equivalent unit will be assigned for each dwelling unit irrespective of the
number of bedrooms in each dwelling unit. "Dwelling unit" shall be as defined by the West Haven
Code Housing Maintenance and Occupancy.[1]
Editor's Note: See Ch. 127, Housing Maintenance and Occupancy.
For industrial, institutional, governmental and commercial users, annual user charges will be
based on equivalent units determined by dividing the annual water use in gallons as measured by
their water meter by 91,250, rounded up to the nearest whole number. A minimum of one
equivalent unit will be assigned to each user if the equivalent units as determined above are less
than one.

If a governmental, commercial, institutional or industrial user has a consumptive use of water or in
some other manner uses water which is not discharged into the water collection system, the user
charge for that contributor may be based on readings of a wastewater meter(s) or separate water
meter(s) installed and maintained at the user's expense when approved by the Water Pollution
Control Commission. Equivalent units will be determined by the Water Pollution Control
Commission.
Water consumption for users not served by a metered water supply shall be estimated by the
Water Pollution Control Commission on the basis of information submitted to it by the user and on
the basis of records it has of water consumption of similar buildings and users. In order to expedite
such estimates, the Water Pollution Control Commission may require the user of any such
property not serviced by a metered water supply to submit a sworn statement of water
consumption for the year, with such statement to be supported by any available records or other
evidence of water consumption. The Commission may also require the user of any such property
not serviced by a metered water supply to install and maintain a water meter at the sole expense
of such user.
For those users whose wastewater has a greater strength than normal domestic sewage, a
surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be collected. The surcharge for operation and
maintenance, including replacement, shall be determined by the Water Pollution Control
Commission.
Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants (as defined in Chapter 191 of the West Haven
Code, entitled "Sewers"), which causes an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the
sludge from the City of West Haven's treatment works, or any user which discharges any
substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the
cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works shall pay for such increased
costs. The charge to each user shall be determined by the WPCC and the City Council.
The user charge rates established in this Article apply to all users of the City of West Haven's
treatment works. Any party in the Town of Orange or any other area outside of the City of West
Haven who is not connected to the Orange Sewer District lines and is discharging wastewater to
the West Haven wastewater treatment facilities shall pay for such services in the same manner as
the users of the City of West Haven. Equivalent unit costs for such users shall be increased 50%
to account for capital cost of the facilities.
Users outside of the City of West Haven and the Town of Orange Sewer District shall submit a
copy of their water bill which shows their annual water usage to be used for billing purposes.
Users in the City of West Haven and the Town of Orange Sewer District need not submit such
information, unless requested, as such necessary information will be obtained directly by the
WPCC.
§ 222-29. Billing.
All users shall be billed one time per year. The bill shall represent the total amount owed for the
usage during the past year based on the actual records of the past year. The City Council shall
allow payments to be made in two installments. Any payment not received within 30 days after the
date(s) specified on the bill shall be delinquent.
Bills shall be sent out at the same time property tax notices are sent.
A late payment penalty of 1.5% of the user charge bill will be added to each delinquent bill for
each 30 days or portion thereof of delinquency. When any bill is more than 90 days in default, a
penalty of 5% of the user charge bill will be added to each delinquent bill for each 30 days or
portion thereof of delinquency. All interest shall be compounded on a monthly basis.

When any bill (including interest and penalty) remains unpaid for one year after the date due, such
bill shall be recorded in the land records of the City of West Haven and shall constitute a lien on
the property. If such lien (including interest and penalty) remains unpaid for a period of one year
after the date of recordation, such property shall be subject to public sale by the city.
The Town of Orange (Orange Sewer District) shall be billed and shall pay such bill in accordance
with the Intertown Agreement.
§ 222-30. Wastewater sampling.
[Amended 8-26-1998 by Ord. No. 371]
All users contributing more than 25,000 gallons per day and/or whose waste strength is greater
than 250 milligrams BOD per liter or 250 milligrams suspended solids per liter or 100 milligrams
total oil and grease per liter shall prepare and file with the Water Pollution Control Commission a
report that shall include pertinent data relating to the wastewater characteristics, including the
methods of sampling and measurement to obtain these data, and these data shall be used to
calculate the user charge for that user. The user may submit a new report with updated sampling
results as often as the user deems necessary to ensure an accurate charge rate.
The Water Pollution Control Commission and its designated agents shall have the right gain
access to the waste stream and take its own samples. Should the Water Pollution Control
Commission do so and should the results be substantially different from the data submitted by the
user as determined by the Water Pollution Control Commission, the WPCC may recommend to
the City Council that the charge for that user shall be revised for the next billing cycle period.
Additionally, if the results indicate a higher charge rate, the user shall submit a report within six
months after the issuance of written notification from the WPCC that substantially explains the
difference between the user's filed results and the WPCC's results. If the WPCC determines that
the user's filed results were in any way fraudulent, the WPCC shall recommend to the City Council
that the adjusted charge shall be applied to the previous billing cycles back to the date that the
user's previous results were filed. Any underpayment based on the revised charge rates for that
period shall be owed to the city with a ten-percent penalty applied to the total amount owed.
§ 222-31. Requests for review of user charges.
Any user who feels his user charge is unjust and inequitable may make written application to the
Water Pollution Control Commission requesting a review of his user charge. Said written request
shall, where necessary, show the actual or estimated average flow and strength of his wastewater
in comparison with the values upon which the charge is based, including how the measurements
or estimates were made.
Review of the request shall be made by the Water Pollution Control Commission and, if
substantiated, the WPCC shall recommend to the City Council that the user charges for that user
shall be recomputed based on the revised flow and/or strength data, and the new charges shall be
applicable to the next billing cycle period.
§ 222-32. Review of user charges.
The Water Pollution Control Commission will review the user charges annually as part of its
annual budget review and shall make such recommendations to the City Council in accordance
with this chapter and revise the rates as necessary to ensure that adequate revenues are
generated to pay the costs of operation, maintenance and replacement, and that the system
continues to provide for the proportional distribution of operation, maintenance and replacement
costs among users and user classes.

The Water Pollution Control Commission will notify each user at least annually of the rate being
charged for operation, maintenance and replacement of the treatment works.
The use rate structure (Appendix III-A) and the charge determining formulas (Appendix III-B) will
be revised accordingly whenever a review of the user charges necessitates a revision of the rates
or determining formulas. Should said determining formulas and rate structure prove inadequate to
properly fund the WPCC and distribute the costs, new formulas and rate structures shall be
devised and Council approval obtained so that they may be added to the Appendix of this chapter.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Page 1- 3
1.7 WHEN PROVISIONS CONFLICT
Whenever any provisions of these Regulations and any other provisions of law, whether set forth in this or in any other law, ordinance, or resolution of any kind, impose overlapping of contradictory regulations over the use of the land, or over the use or bulk of buildings or other structures, or contain any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, that provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards or requirements shall govern.

1.8 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
1.8.1 Unless otherwise indicated the zoning district boundary lines are the centerlines of streets, the middle of the channel of waterways, the centerline of main tracks of rail-road lines, or the centerlines of utility rights-of-way. Zoning Districts shall include land under rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or tidewaters, lying within them or within any exten-sion or addition by natural or artificial means, to the shoreline adjacent thereto.
1.8.2 In addition, the boundary of a zoning district shall be interpreted as following pro-perty lines existing at the time of adoption of the zoning map, or any amendment thereto. Where such an interpretation of the map would create an unreasonable distortion of the district, the boundary shall follow a line which is most consistent with adjoining lines.
1.9 LOTS IN MORE THAN ONE ZONE
Where a lot of record of less than two acres at the time of passage of this Regulation or any amendment thereto is mapped into two or more zoning districts, the district that incorporates the majority of the lot area shall be deemed to be the controlling zoning district.

1.10.1 There is currently a principal building located on the lot which use is either con-forming or legally non-conforming;
1.10.2 The request does not create a new non-conforming use nor increase any existing non-conformity;
1.10.3 The lot and structure either comply or were previously complying;
1.10.4 If the permit requests an expansion or addition to the existing structures, such expansion does not create a new non-compliance or increase an existing non-compliance (see below);
1.10.5 The permit does not require the removal of more than 75% of the floor space of the existing principal building;
1.10.6 The request does not increase the number of dwelling units on the lot, except where the request complies with Section 81.6 concerning the required square feet per unit;
1.10.7 The request conforms with the requirements of Section 81.8 and;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Page 1- 4
1.10.8 It is the opinion of the Director of Planning that the property is suitable for the lot and is in general conformity with the surrounding neighborhood.
In the event that the Commissioner of Planning shall disapprove or reject the lot as inappropriate for building, then, the owner or applicant thereof may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals, pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes.

No lot shall be diminished in area nor shall any yard or open space be reduced except in conformity with the provision of this Regulation.
1.12 ADAPTIVE REUSE (Reserved)
1.13 VALIDITY AND SEPARABILITY
It is declared to legislative intent that:
1.13.1 Validity. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Regulations to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to those provisions which are expressly stated in the decision, and all other provisions of these Regulations shall continue to be separately and fully effective.
1.13.2 Separability. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the application of any provision or provisions of these Regulations to any zoning lot, building or any structure, or tract of land to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, the effect of such decision shall be limited to the person, property, or situation immediately involved in the con-troversy and the application of any such provision to other persons, property, or situations shall not be affected.
1.14 Interpretation. Any uses not specifically permitted shall be deemed to be prohibited. Any list of prohibited uses contained in any section of these regulations shall be deemed to be not an exhaustive list but to have been included for the purposes of clarity and emphasis and to illustrate, by example, some of the uses frequently proposed that are deemed undesirable and incompatible in the particular district.

ARTICLE 2: USE REGULATIONS
SECTION 10  RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
10. RESIDENCE DISTRICT REGULATIONS
10.1 GENERAL PURPOSES OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
The purposes of these regulations are to:
? promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
? maintain neighborhood integrity, protect property values, provide sufficient light and open space between buildings.
? maintain control over the quality of the environment of the community.
? prevent congestion of streets, regulate demand on public services,
? provide sufficient room for growth and diversity of housing needs and styles to meet community needs now and in the future.
10.2 OBJECTIVES OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
It is recognized that certain neighborhoods have already become overcrowded due to the intrusion of multi-family dwellings and the increasing conversion of single-family homes to two or three family homes. Through the graduation of density, together with appropriate open space requirements and buffers, both natural and required by these regulations, it is the objective to prevent improper disruption, intrusion and overcrowding in existing neighborhoods and discourage further increases in density.
10.3 INTENT OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
It is hereby recognized that the City of West Haven is a community which at the time of these regulations enactment is mostly developed with very little undeveloped or underdeveloped land. In interpreting these regulations great consideration should be given to existing community characteristics. The intent of the regulations is to:
? use multi-family districts as buffers between single-family areas and commercial or industrial areas and provide a gradation in density between the least and most dense residential districts whenever possible.
? prevent the overcrowding of existing areas by further increases in density.
? prevent additional overcrowding and haphazard development.
? limit those instances where a variance can be granted.
? encourage the preservation and protection of historical and architecturally significant buildings.
? encourage the mixture of residential and commercial use where appropriate.
? replace variances with provisions for Special Permit Uses, Special Exceptions and Special Use Exceptions to the area and bulk requirements. Granting of any variance where the foregoing special categories would be applicable would be a violation of these regulations.
10.4 GENERAL STANDARDS OF RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
10.4.1 Permitted Uses
In each district certain uses are permitted, subject to all the applicable §10.4 General Standards and the requirements below, are permitted as shown in Table 39.1 Summary of Uses in Residential Districts, where the letter R indicates a use permitted As-of-Right.
10.4.2 Structures and Projections within Required Yards in all Residential Districts shall be permitted as follows:
1. In any Yard the following projections shall be permitted:
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018

a. Flag poles, non-enclosed steps or stoops having ground coverage of not more than thirty (30) square feet.
b. Arbors or trellises, awnings or canopies, chimneys, gutters or downspouts, eaves or cornices, whether decorative or structural; provided they do not extend more than three (3) feet into a yard or twenty (20%) of the actual setback, whichever is less, and are attached to the building.
c. Porches or decks, including steps, which project not more than one-third (1/3) into a required yard.
d. Porches or decks, including steps, which do not diminish the existing side yard.
2. In Side or Rear Yards only the following structures shall be permitted:
a. Garages, tool or storage sheds or non-commercial greenhouses, are per-mitted as-of right as follows:
i. A minimum of four (4) feet from side and/or rear lot lines if the property width is fifty (50) feet wide or less; or
ii. A minimum of six (6) feet from side and/or rear lot lines if the property is more than fifty (50) feet wide.

4. Accessory Uses and Structures. Off- street surface parking, detached garages and storage sheds or tool sheds are permitted as-of-right in all residential districts.
10.5 SPECIAL PERMIT USES
Certain uses in residential districts are allowed only by Special Permit at the discretion of the Commission, subject to the standards and procedures of Article 80  Zoning Administration and Article 75  Site Plan Review.
Inclusion of non-residential uses that are appropriate and compatible with residential neighborhoods is encouraged. However, since not every lot may be suited to accommodate every type of use, non-residential uses are to be allowed only on a limited basis by Special Permit with appropriate safeguards for each individual case.
It is hereby recognized that certain non-residential uses are a necessary part of the community and if properly controlled are compatible with residential neighbor-hoods. In making its decision on any application for a Special Permit use the Commission must weigh the interests of the community in having the use with the interests of the landowner. If the Commission deems that the proposed use is in the best interests of the community as a whole, it shall make written findings and find the application consistent with the Plan of Conservation and Development. In Table 39.1 Summary of Uses in Residential and Mixed Uses, the letters SP indicate a use allowed by Special Permit.
10.6 SPECIAL USE EXCEPTIONS
After a consideration of the potential impact of the request on the surrounding neighborhood, the Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a Special Use Excep-tion to permit the use with any conditions the Commission may determine are necessary to protect the neighborhood.

In Table 39.1 Summary of Uses in Residential and Mixed Use Districts the letters SU indicate a use allowed by Special Use Exception.
10.7 ALTERNATIVE FRONT YARD SETBACK STANDARD
Where 75% or more of the entire street frontage (in feet) on the same side of the street between the two nearest intersections has been developed with front yards smaller than that required in the zoning district, the required front yard shall be the same as the yard presently followed by existing buildings along the greatest quantity of street frontage (in feet).
10.8 AREA AND BULK REGULATIONS
It is the intent of these regulations to provide for the minimum requirements in all districts so as to prevent overcrowding. No lot shall be used and no building shall be erected except in conformity with the bulk regulations as set forth herein, except as may be otherwise permitted within these regulations or specifically per-mitted by the Connecticut General Statutes.
No new lot shall be created after the adoption of these regulations which does not conform to the requirements of this section, except as may be permitted under Section 82.
All applicable bulk requirements, including off-street parking, shall be located on same lot which shall consist of one contiguous parcel of land. However, nothing shall prohibit the combination of more than one parcel of land to form a single lot.
10.9 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PRIOR COMPLYING LOTS AND BUILDINGS
Any existing lot or building which was complying under any previous zoning regula-tion but does not now comply with the requirements of this Article shall not be removed, demolished or abandoned, except as may be required under Section 81.
Such existing lot or building, however, shall not hereafter change its use or have any construction taken relative thereto, without complying with the provisions of Section 81.

It is the intent of these bulk regulations to provide minimum requirements in all commercial districts to prevent overcrowding. No lot shall be used and no building shall be erected except in conformity with the regulations as set forth herein, except as may otherwise be permitted with these regulations or specifically permitted by the Connecticut General Statutes. No new lot shall be created after the adoption of these regulations that does not conform to the requirements of this Chapter.
Except in the Central Business District, all applicable bulk requirements, including off-street parking, shall be located on the same lot which shall consist of one contiguous parcel of land. However, nothing herein shall prohibit combination of more than one parcel of land to form a single lot.

20.6 INTENT AND PURPOSE OF COMMERCIAL DISTRICT DESIGN CRITERIA
It is hereby found that in promoting commercial and industrial growth in the city it is necessary to develop criteria for building layout and design to insure that the standards listed forthwith are met by all future commercial growth. The following design guidelines are incorporated into the Zoning Regulations of the City of West Haven as part of the Commercial District Bulk Regulations.
The districts affected by this plan are designated in the enclosed maps. Within these districts, it will be necessary to provide elevation drawings of facade construction for any building permit or any application before the Planning and Zoning Com-mission or the Zoning Board of Appeals. The criteria for design or maintenance or the historical aesthetics of a new or existing building and criteria for new buildings are outlined in the following pages.
20.6.1 Central Business District Supplemental Intent and Purpose Statement. The CBD design guidelines have been implemented to give continuity to the revitalization effort and
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018
COMMERCIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page 20-3
to insure success of West Havens plan for encouraging development and new business in primary commercial areas. The basis for these guidelines is to create a downtown business district with character and a sense of place. The purposes are to:
? preserve quality historic structures.
? design compatible new infill development.
? restore vitality and economic strength to West Havens Central Business District.
? create special areas within the district which possess a mix of uses integrated by complementary activities.
20.6.2 Design Guidelines for CBD Development. This section provides guidance to devel-opers, architects, and property owners who seek to redevelop the downtown area. In addition the Planning and Development Department office is available to provide assistance and guidance.
The Central Business District of West Haven is one of the older working centers of the city. The Plan of Conservation and Development has targeted this area for mixed-use development combining higher density residential uses mixed with retail commercial and office use. The area is delineated by Elm Street and Court Street to the north and south, and Savin Avenue and Washington Avenue to the west and east (See Map 20.1 Central Business Design District below).
Illustration 20.1 Central Business Design District
The development guidelines are divided into three sections; building uses and design; traffic circulation and parking provisions, and: streetscape open space design.
1. Continuous ground floor retail, service and entertainment facilities should be incorporated into new development and conversion of existing buildings. Housing is

encouraged in the upper floors of the development to enliven business and economic activity throughout the day and week.
2. Buildings should be situated directly on the front property line with no at grade setbacks except at building entrances with the exception of landscaped walkways or courtyards given the setback is no more than five (5) feet for walkways and ten (10) feet for courtyards. All structures must be set back five (5) feet above the fourth floor. No building may exceed six (6) stories in this district, and no historic building may be altered to increase its existing height.
3. Buildings should be no longer than 100 feet in length and be designed with con-sideration for architectural detailing (awnings, cornices, eaves, signs, windows and fenestration) which create visual interest, and break up the front plane of the building. Restoration of historic features should be considered whenever possible (see Illustration 20.1).
Illustration 20.2 Avoid Attempts at Hiding an Older Façade.
Buildings should be a minimum of two stories in height, and preferably 3-4 stories, in order to promote efficient land use and create a development mass to maintain a sense of urban density in this area. All buildings should be at least as tall as adjacent parking structures and the principal use of the lot should be located between the street and any parking facilities.
4. Any new development should relate to the existing streetscape environment in architecture, scale, shape and surface treatment to create symmetry between new and existing structures. Natural materials such as brick, stone, and wood should be emphasized. Reflective mirrors and glass are not only visually distracting, but a hazard to reflected traffic lights and are prohibited.
5. Architectural Standards by which to measure new development new construction, remodeling, and reconstruction have not been developed. Therefore new structures shall be modeled after existing historical structures such as the A.F. and J.P Woos building (Silvers Drug), the Thompson Block (original Altschuler Building). In a case where a new building deviates from this standard by producing an innovative design, it shall be the function of the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine whether the design will blend architecturally with surrounding buildings.

Illustration 20.3 The Thomson Block/Altschuler Building
20.7 STREETSCAPE AND OPEN SPACE DESIGN IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD)
1. Preserve and Incorporate Natural Site Amenities. New development should be designed to preserve and incorporate natural site amenities, such as water views, trees, areas adjacent to public spaces and other similar features, into their site plans.
2. Streetscape improvements would be incorporated into the site design of all new structures and proposed renovations of more than $25,000. Such improvements will be compatible with the materials/designs used in municipal improvements that have been initiated; including the following site elements illustrated below (Illustration 20.4):
? Pedestrian area lighting
? Widened sidewalks/mini parks
? Seating (benches/low walls/wide planter edges)
? Signing
? Trash receptacles/billiards/bus shelters
? Granite curbing with brick/concrete paving patterns

Illustration 20.6 Sign Placement and Design
4. Signs Location. Signs should be located on building facades below the sills of second floor windows as shown on the diagram above. Wall murals and flags or banners which contain no advertising are permitted provided they comply with applicable sign regulations. Billboards are strictly prohibited in the CBD as are roof signs and ground signs other than those exempted from permit procedures.
Signs within windows shall be strictly prohibited as they distract from the continuity of front window displays. The posting of temporary signs shall be exempted if the owner provides no more than two (4FT x 3FT) framed boxes per facing (See Illustration 20.6 Sign Placement and Design) as approved by the Planning and Development Department. Changeable signs (such as those announcing grocery specials) may be posted within these frames.
One sign per window of not more than 10 x 24 inches announcing a temporary sale shall be allowed for no more than fifteen (15) days. Non-conforming signs of this nature will not be replaced should the repair of the structure be necessary. Ground signs that list existing businesses on one lot are encouraged.
4. Establishing a Sense of Open Space. Greening vacant open spaces or window boxes or ledges can establish a sense of open space and therefore create an attractive public area that encourages shoppers and retail trade. Therefore property owners are encouraged to take advantage of small underutilized spaces to create pocket gardens, greened alleys or courtyards. These areas should be open to the public as access to other shopping areas and maintained year round. A diagram of such amenities will be furnished with the alteration plans submitted to the Planning and Development Department.

INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page 25-1
SECTION 25  INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
25.1 GENERAL PURPOSES OF INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
The Industrial Districts established in this Zoning Regulation are designed to provide a tax and employment base to the City of West Haven. It is hereby recognized that the City of West Haven at the time of the adoption of these regulations is sub-stantially developed. However, it is equally recognized that the future health of the City requires continued expansion of its industrial base. These regulations are designed to encourage modernization and development of the Citys industrial potential while protecting the public health, safety and general welfare. It is recognized that while these goals are sometimes contradictory, cohesive industrial development can meet the community needs and concerns now and in the future.
25.2 INTENT
It is the further intent of these regulations:
? To separate and segregate industrial uses from residential and commercial uses, and
? to encourage industrial development which is free from the danger of fire, toxic and noxious matter, explosions and other hazards, and
? to prevent as much as possible development that will cause offensive, noise, vibration, smoke, dust and particulate matter odor, and
? to provide sufficient accessory use facilities to prevent traffic congestion and safety hazards, and
? to locate industrial uses in such areas where provision can be made to protect adjoining non-industrial districts through natural or constructed buffers.
25.3 USE REGULATIONS
25.3.1 Interpretation. Whenever an application is presented which might be categorized under more than one use type as listed in this section the use which is more descriptive shall control (specific shall control over general) and any dispute over same shall be determined by the Commissioner of Planning and Development, subject to right of review before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
25.3.2 Uses Permitted As-Of-Right. In each district certain uses are permitted as-of-right and do not require approval of either the Commission or the Board, except where a Site Plan is required, but require a CZC (Certificate of Zoning Compliance) be issued when the application conforms to all applicable requirements.
Table 39.2 Summary Table of Uses in Commercial, Mixed Use, Industrial and Other Districts indicates uses permitted As-of-Right.
25.3.3 Special Permit and Special Use Exceptions. It is recognized that certain industrial uses are a necessary part of the community and if properly regulated are compatible with surrounding uses. In making its decision on any application for a Special Use Exception or Special Permit the Commission shall weigh community and landowner interests in establishing the use.
Applications for Special Permits and Special Use Exceptions in Industrial Districts shall be reviewed using the procedures and criteria of Article 8 of this Regulation and shall be subject to the standards and procedures of Article 10, including a Public Hearing and Section 75, Site Plan Review.
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018
INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page 25-2
If the Commission deems that the proposed use is in the best interests of the community as a whole, it shall make findings relative to the interest of the community and consistency of the application with the Plan of Conservation and Development. In Table 39.2 Summary Table of Uses in Commercial, Mixed Use, Industrial and Other Districts the letters SU indicate a use allowed by Special Use Exception and the letters SP indicate a use allowed by Special Permit.
25.3.4 Supplemental Standards for Special Permit Uses in Industrial Districts. The Commission shall establish conditions and requirements to protect adjoining property values and to minimize any potential traffic, safety or other hazard. In granting any Special Permit the Commission may:
1. Establish conditions affecting the operation, location and use provided same fulfills the purposes of this Section and Article.
2. Require landscape buffers of not less than 75 feet or more than 100 feet when adjoining any district other than Industrial Planned Development Zones.
3. Require a licensed engineer certify that the facility as designed and built will meet all federal, state and local standards for air, water and noise pollution.
25.4 ACCESSORY USES
In all Industrial districts off-street parking and loading shall be a permitted accessory use. Outside storage and retail sales (provided same is less than 10% of gross floor space) may be allowed by Special Permit.

PLANNED VILLAGE DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page 26-1
SECTION 26 PLANNED VILLAGE DISTRICT (PVD)
26. PLANNED VILLAGE DISTRICT (PVD) OVERLAY ZONE
The Planned Village District (PVD) Overlay Zone is intended to allow for an alternative mixed use development of large tracts of vacant Business Park /industrially zoned land that contain topographic and environmental restraints that may restrict development of the property for office/light industrial use. The PVD Overlay Zone allows for a development mix that provides employment and fiscal benefits to the City consistent with the underlying Business/industrial zone, while also allowing residential uses particularly where topographical and site constraints limit the feasibility of nonresidential development. The zone shall function as an overlay zone, such that the underlying Business/Industrial zone shall continue to govern development of the land, provided that, if the PVD Overlay zone is mapped on the site and the PVD Master Plan is approved in accordance with the procedures set forth herein, the site may also be developed in accordance with the PVD Master Plan and the PVD standards set forth herein.
A development pursuant to the PVD Overlay requires both legislative and administrative approvals from the Planning & Zoning Commission. The legislative approvals are the adoption of the PVD Overlay on a site, which renders the site eligible for treatment as a PVD, and the adoption of the PVD Master Plan, which sets forth the mixture of buildings and uses within the development. The administrative approvals are the Site Plan and/or Special Permit, which must conform to the PVD Master Plan and other standards set forth herein. In order to provide flexibility to the developer, an applicant shall be allowed to submit applications either simultaneously or sequentially, provided that no special permit or site plan application may be filed until after the adoption of the PVD Overlay Zone and PVD Master Plan for the Site.
Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section 26, any property located within a PVD Overlay zone may be developed and used in any manner permitted in the underlying industrial zone without the requirement of a PVD Master Plan.
26.1 PURPOSE
? To provide an alternate form of development for remaining larger industrially-zoned land tracts of West Haven that generally have topographic and/or environmental constraints such as ledge, the presence of significant streams and/or wetlands, flood plain, or contain forests.
? To retain large portions of a site in a natural undisturbed or minimally disturbed state by use of smart growth design techniques and to provide alternative development forms that encourage business growth, entrepreneurship and business ownership.
? To allow for high quality age-restricted and other appropriate housing types with a variety of sizes and floor areas that will meet the housing needs of West Haven citizens in a manner that will stimulate other economically beneficial uses of the site and surrounding areas.
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018
PLANNED VILLAGE DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Page 26-2
? To allow for development mixture that will provide a positive economic impact to the City consistent with the underlying business/industrial zone.
26.2 PROCEDURES FOR ADOPTION OF PVD OVERLAY ZONE
26.2.1 Application Review. Pursuant to General Statutes Section 7-159b, an applicant for a PVD Overlay Zone or a PVD Master Plan may request a preapplication review with the Planning & Zoning Commission, or its authorized agents prior to the submission of an application.

Any statements by members of the Commission are not binding and are not intended to indicate prejudgment in any way of an actual application, should one later be submitted. Similarly, silence by Commission members during an informal review should not be construed as assent or acceptance of what is presented. The Commission's official decision-making process only commences upon the submission of a formal application.
26.2.2 Establishment of PVD Overlay Zone. Establishing a PVD Overlay Zone requires approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission of a zoning map change application, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut and Section 86 of these Regulations for a zone change and public hearing.
26.2.3 PVD Master Plan. The PVD Master Plan is a condition precedent to a specific development in a PVD Overlay Zone. The PVD Master Plan shall establish the development criteria applicable to the project, e.g., without limitation, the proposed layout of the structures, the infrastructure and roadways within the zone, the mix of uses within the zone, density of residential development and design standards. The Master Plan shall be consistent with the building and development standards set forth below. The Master Plan will establish the dimensional characteristics of the PVD Overlay Zone and its uses, and shall encompass the development of the entire PVD tract.
The PVD Master Plan application shall be prepared by appropriate certified professionals and shall consist of all of the materials as required by West Haven Zoning Regulations and the West Haven Land Use Application - Zoning Map Change (as the same may be amended from time to time) including:

SECTION 27 INCENTIVE HOUSING ZONE (IHZ)
27. INCENTIVE HOUSING ZONE (IHZ)
The Incentive Housing Zone (IHZ) is an overlay zone which is established by a Change of Zone by the planning and zoning commission and development within the zone is allowed only by Special Permit to encourage responsible development and redevelopment or partially developed parcels of land in West Haven. The IHZ is designed to further the goals of the State and City Plan of conservation and development, to concentrate in areas with available public utilities.
27.1 Purpose
? To provide an alternative form of development for the currently developed, partially developed or under-utilized land and structures
? To encourage development of general and incubator office, commercial, heavy commercial and industrial space.
? To encourage development of affordable housing in new developments
? To prevent sprawl and traffic congestion by encouraging a more vibrant residential component to business or mixed use areas.
? To encourage development which supports a lifestyle in which residents can walk or use public transportation to reach jobs, services and recreational or cultural opportunities.
? To encourage transit oriented mixed use developments.

35.9 Parking Standards
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
Page 35-7
This section seeks to balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and transit users with necessary parking. Parking should accommodate the minimum number of spaces necessary to support the uses it serves, without being excessive, in order to support an active, walkable TOD, not degrade the public realm and remain compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
35.9.1 Shared parking shall be encouraged. In general, parking both on-street and off-street in the TOD shall be treated as a shared resource. A goal is to achieve mixed-use park-once areas where multiple destinations are served by parking once, or one time. The land uses and projects within the TOD are therefore encouraged to share parking, so that different land uses that occupy parking at different times of day may use the same parking spaces; this will reduce paved surfaces, minimize environmental impacts and enhance the non-motorist realm.
35.9.2 On-street parking abutting a particular lot, on all sides, shall be counted toward fulfilling parking requirements.
35.9.3 Parking shall conform to Section 60: Parking, Loading and Access Standards, except if those standards are superceded by the standards listed in this section:

b. Section 60.24: Parking areas, where possible, should be screened by buildings.
c. Section 60.25  A landscape buffer between different uses in TOD shall not be required.
35.9.4 Required off-street parking spaces shall conform to the following requirements:
a. The number of spaces shall be provided in accord with Table 62.1: Summary Table of Parking and Loading Requirements, except for the following standards which shall supersede.
i. Multi-family dwelling units located within within 1,320 feet (¼ mile) of train station property shall meet the following minimum standards:
1. 1 bedroom and studio units shall require a minimum of 1 parking space/unit and a maximum of 1.5 spaces/unit.
2. 2 bedroom units shall require a minimum of 1.25 parking spaces/unit and a maximum of 1.5 spaces/unit.
ii. Residential uses beyond 1,320 feet (¼ mile) from the train station property and within the study area shall have minimum parking in accordance with the underlying zoning, but no more than 1.5 spaces per dwelling unit.
iii. Office uses within 1,320 feet (¼ mile) of the train station shall have minimum 2.75 spaces/1,000 square feet and a maximum of 3.25 spaces/1,000 square feet for reserved parking.

e. Where alleys are unavailable, excluding for townhouses, parking may be accessed by driveways directly from the street.
f. Parking entrances shall not face public open spaces.
g. Curb cuts shall be kept to a minimum along all streets.
35.9.6 Above-grade parking structures, or portions of underground parking that protrude above grade shall comply with the following requirements:
h. Primary and secondary frontages shall be lined with an active use at grade for a minimum depth of 30 feet along a minimum of 50% of its frontages, or shall be screened on all levels with an architectural treatment compatible with the building for 100% of its frontages.
i. Internal elements such as pipes, fans and lights shall be concealed from public view.
j. Pedestrian access into above-grade parking structures shall be directly to a street or public frontage.

48 TELECOMMUNICATION REGULATION
48.1 Description and Purpose.
These regulations exist to protect neighborhoods, minimize conflict with adjacent uses and the surrounding area, and to assure the health and safety of the public. The City finds that these regulations are necessary to protect the ecological, scenic, historical and recreational values of the City and to ensure that adverse visual and operational effects will not contribute to blighting or deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood. The City recognizes that the Connecticut Siting Council has jurisdiction for certain facilities under Connecticut Law, but these regulations govern other telecommunication antennas and related equipment. More specifically, the purposes are:
? To accommodate the need for wireless communications antennas while regulating their location and number.
? To minimize adverse visual effects of wireless communications antennas and wireless site towers through proper design, siting and screening.
? To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antennas or wireless site towers through their proper siting, co-location, engineering and screening.
? To reduce the number of antennas or wireless site(s) needed in the future.
48.2 Definitions.
When used in this section words or phrases shall have the meaning defined below:
ALTERATIONS: The upgrade or change of any and all equipment or antennas associated with a telecommunications operation. Upgrades in equipment or advances in technology which have no visual impact and do not increase site and/or height are subject to Sec.48.13.
ANTENNA: A device used to collect or transmit telecommunications or radio signals. Examples include panels, microwave dishes and single pole devices known as whips. The following are excluded from the definition of antenna: satellite dishes for television use.
HEIGHT: The vertical distance measured from the ground level what is attached to the antenna or cabinet to the highest point of the structure. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the lowest grades shall be used in calculating the antenna height.
WIRELESS SITE: The equipment and structures involved in receiving or transmitting telecommunications or radio signals from a mobile radio
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS

communications source and transmitting those signals to another wireless site, another communications source or receiver, or to a central switching computer that connects the mobile unit with land-based telephone lines.
TOWER: A structure located on the ground or on the top of a building that is intended to support equipment used to transmit and/or receive telecommunications or radio signals. Examples of such structures include monopoles and lattice construction steel structures.
48.3 Site Selection Policies and guidelines:
Applicants should consider locating wireless sites based upon the following policy preferences:
.
1. In locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
2. In locations which are found to be the least visually obtrusive.
3. In locations which are least disruptive to the public health, safety and welfare and consistent with the Citys Plan of Conservation and Development.
4. In locations which have minimal impact upon residences.
5. In locations to establish opportunities for co-location of multiple carriers.
6. Installation on buildings or structures located on a historic register or within a historic district shall be discouraged.
7. For Residential Districts, the following additional guidelines shall apply: Wireless telecommunications facilities that include towers are discouraged in single-family or two-family residential districts with the exception of placement on any property with an institutional use (e.g., church, park, library, municipal/government, hospital, school, utility) located in either of these two districts. In applying for a permit in any residential district, the applicant must present substantial evidence as to why it is not technically feasible to locate in a more appropriate nonresidential zone, along with meeting the other standards set in these regulations. The applicant must also demonstrate that the wireless telecommunications facility will not have a substantial impact on neighboring property values.

WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
70-6
being restored, before the damage occurred. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. (For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether of not that alteration affects the external dimension of the structure.) The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure.
VARIANCE: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this regulation which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this regulation where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
VIOLATION: Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the citys flood plain management regulations.

WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods or various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or riverine areas.
70.11 FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
Flood Hazard Areas include all areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New Haven County, Connecticut dated July 8, 2013, accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated July 8, 2013, and other supporting data applicable to the City of West Haven, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation, it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA. The area of special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones, A, AE, and VE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Zone VE are also identified as Coastal High Hazard Areas. Areas of special flood hazard are determined by utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location.
70.12 PERMIT REQUIRED
In any Flood Hazard Area, no land shall be filled or excavated and building or other structure shall be constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, moved or structurally
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
70-7
altered until a site plan has been approved by the Commissioner of Planning and Development and a building permit issued by the Building Official in accordance with these regulations, the State Building Code and any other applicable city ordinances or state statutes and all applicable state and federal permits have been obtained. This requirement may also be placed on any property which is subject to periodic flooding and inundation but which is not listed on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map at the discretion of the Commissioner of Planning and Development after consultation with the City Engineer, the Inland Wetland Agency and any other appropriate city officials.
70.13 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
1. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be anchored to prevent floatation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting in hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage, and be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
3. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located safely to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
4. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
5. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, storm and sanitary sewers, electrical and water systems both new and replacement are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage and infiltration.
6. On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding.
7. The flood carrying capacity within altered or relocated water courses is to be maintained.
8. All manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than ten (10) feet apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six (6) feet above ground.
9. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the city, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in the footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that such encroachments shall not result in an (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
70-8
10. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100 year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the city.
11. Aboveground Storage Tanks. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of a structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
12. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirement of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
13. Structures in Two Flood Zones. If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
70.14 FLOODWAY REQUIREMENTS
1. In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
2. Should data be requested and/or provided, the city shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse.
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
70-9
3. A regulatory floodway has been established on the Floor Insurance Rate Map by reference. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectile and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a. No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless certification, with supporting technical data, by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of open design.
b. If provision (a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions general and specific standards.
70.15 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR A ZONES
The following provisions shall apply in all areas of special flood hazard AE or A zones where base flood elevation data has been provided in accordance with Sections
70.18 and 70.20 of these regulations
1. Residential  all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall be the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
2. Non-residential  all new construction and substantial improvements to non-residential structures are required to:
a. have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the base flood level or;

NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS OR STRUCTURES
PAGE 81-1
SECTION 81  NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS OR STRUCTURES
81.1 STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND PURPOSE
The Zoning Districts established in these regulations are designed to guide the future use of the Citys land by encouraging the development of desirable resi-dential, commercial and manufacturing areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus, to promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare through the establishment of minimal area and bulk standards which are determined in conformity with the intended, permitted use of the property and surrounding properties.
As a necessary corollary, in order to carry out such purposes, non-conforming or non-complying uses which adversely affect the development of such areas must be subject to certain limitations. The regulations governing non-conforming and non-complying uses set forth in this Article are therefore adopted in order to provide a gradual remedying of existing undesirable conditions resulting from such incompat-ible use of property which is detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of these regulations. When such uses are generally permitted to continue, these regulations are designed to restrict further investment in such uses which would make them more permanent establishments in inappropriate locations.
In the case of buildings, structures and/or lots not complying with the applicable area and bulk requirements of the regulations, the regulations governing same set forth in this Article are adopted to permit the appropriate use of such buildings, but prevent the creation of additional non-compliances, increases in the degree of existing noncompliance or expansions which would be detrimental to the safety and welfare of the surrounding neighborhood.
These regulations are thus designed to preserve the character of the Districts established in these regulations in the light of their particular suitability to specified uses, and thus to promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare.
81.2 DEFINITIONS
Each of the following definitions shall apply to situations which will arise from time to time in the interpretations of these regulations with respect to non-conforming uses and non-complying lots or structures. Each definition is intended to define a specific situation and is therefore mutually exclusive.
ABANDONMENT: The voluntary discontinuance of the use of the property in a non-conforming manner, and such discontinuance is accompanied by an intent to not reestablish such use, building or structure.
CHANGE OF USE: The change or modification of a use type as determined by the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission (e.g.: retail store to wholesale warehouse, two family to three family dwelling, assembly to fabrication, etc., but not to include shoe store to book store, tool and die shop to grinding shop, etc.).
DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION: The removal, destruction or demolition, whether inten-tional or unintentional, of existing floor space such that such floor space whether or not continuous, is unusable. For the purpose of this Article, any such damage or destruction which occurs over an extended period of time (but within two years from first occurrence) shall be deemed to be a single event.
DISCONTINUANCE: The intentional or unintentional cessation of a nonconforming use of the property on a daily basis.
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATION 12/31/2018
NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS OR STRUCTURES
PAGE 81-2
ENLARGEMENTS OR EXTENSIONS: An increase in the building or structure size or the increase in lot coverage.
EXPANSION OF USE: 1) The change of a non-conforming use to a use determined to be less-conforming, 2) The addition of another non-conforming use to an existing non-conforming use, or 3) The increase in the intensity of an existing nonconforming use (including additional dwellings).
INCIDENTAL REPAIRS OR ALTERATIONS: The replacement, upgrading or renovation of existing building characteristics or systems, provided that such work does not create any additional units, rooms, or a greater degree of lot coverage.
MERGER OF LOTS: The combined use, including use by accessory uses, of one or more recognized lots.
81.3 NON-CONFORMING USES
81.3.1 Intent. It is the intent of these Regulations to develop cohesive zoning districts which have compatible uses. It is therefore recognized that any use which pre-exists these Regulations that does not conform to its requirements shall be encouraged to phase itself out and be replaced by conforming, or at least more conforming uses that would be more compatible with the uses in the district in which the property lies.
81.3.2 Non-Conforming Residential Uses. Except as otherwise provided herein, no property which presently being utilized for residential purposes shall be required to terminate because of its non-conforming status, provided said use was conforming at the time of its origination.
81.3.3 Discontinuance of Dangerous Uses in Residential Districts. In all Residence Districts, any non-conforming use providing objectionable to public health, safety, or general welfare by creating danger of fire, explosion, toxic and noxious matter, radiation or other hazards of offensive noise, vibration, smoke dust or other particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare or other objectionable influences, shall be dis-continued upon order of the Commissioner of Planning and Development. Such order may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals under Section 88.3.
81.3.4 Abandonment. In all districts, if either the non-conforming use of land with minor improvements is abandoned, or the active operation of substantially all the non-conforming uses in any building or other structure is abandoned, such land or building or other structure shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use. Discontinuance of such use will be determined to be abandonment if there is also an intent to discontinue such use, building or structure.
81.3.5 Change of Non-Conforming Use for the purpose of this section is a change to another use not of the same use type, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission. A change in ownership or occupancy shall not by itself constitute a change of use.
A non-conforming use may be changed to a conforming use and the applicable district bulk regulations and accessory off-street parking and loading requirements shall apply to such change of use or to alterations made to accommodate such conforming use wherever possible, but shall apply to an enlargement or expansion. A formerly nonconforming use shall not again be changed to a non-conforming use.
However, no change of use shall be permitted without application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, who shall review such application as is it were a Special Permit application and follow relevant procedures.

NON-COMPLYING LOTS OR STRUCTURES
PAGE 82-1
SECTION 82  NON-COMPLYING LOTS OR STRUCTURES
82. NON-COMPLYING LOTS OR STRUCTURES
82.1 Intent. It is the intent of the Regulations to regulate the use of property in lots having minimum sizes, dimensions and characteristics. It is also the intent of these Regulations that the structures located on said lots shall similarly comply with certain dimensional requirements. However, it is also recognized that the City of West Haven is a com-munity which is, at the time of adoption of these Regulations, primarily developed or with undeveloped lots which have received prior approvals. These Regulations, there-fore, permit under specified circumstances with appropriate controls, the continued use of new development of lots or structures which do not conform to current area and bulk requirements, on a limited and specifically restricted basis.
82.2 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PRIOR COMPLYING LOTS AND BUILDINGS
82.2.1 General Provisions. The continued use of a non-complying building or other structure shall be permitted, except as otherwise provided by this article. A non-complying building is defined as one in which its use complies with that as permitted by these regulations either as of right, by Special Permit, by Special Use Exception or as a valid nonconforming use, but does not comply with the area and bulk requirement of the Regulations for each district. A non-complying structure, therefore, does not refer to the use to which the property is being put, but rather the location, size or similar characteristic of the structure. No new building or structure shall be erected except as provided herein. In interpreting this Section, each subsection shall be deemed mutually exclusive such that only one subsection shall apply to any particular situation.
82.2.2 Repairs and Alterations. Incidental repairs and alterations may be made in a non-complying building or other structure, provided they do not create a new non-compliance or increase the degree of non-compliance of the building or other structure or any portion thereof.
82.2.3 Enlargements or Conversions. A non-complying building or other structure may be enlarged or converted provided that no enlargement or conversion may be made which would either create a new non-compliance or increase the degree of non-compliance of the building or other structure or any portion thereof. An enlargement is defined as creating additional units, rooms, or a greater degree of lot coverage.
If an existing lot and building are noncomplying because the lot area per dwelling unit is less than required then such building may be enlarged, converted only pro-vided that the deficiency in the required lot area per dwelling unit is not increased.
82.2.4 (Section deleted, 10/10/17, File # ZR-17-063).
.
82.3 DEGREE OF NONCOMPLIANCE
82.3.1 Residential. For the purposes of this section, it shall not be considered an increase in the degree of noncompliance if construction is requested, hereinabove, within required setbacks or yards, provided that each of the following is met:
1. New construction is no closer to the property line than the existing building line;
2. The existing yard is at least 50% of the required set-back;
3. Length of that part of the building which is within the yard is less than 30% of the length of the adjacent boundary line;
WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING REGULATIONS 12/31/2018
NON-COMPLYING LOTS OR STRUCTURES
PAGE 82-2
4. In the case where an addition is requested that would increase the height of a structure that is within the required yard setback, the height may only be only be increased in the proportion of one foot in height to every foot in distance between the requested expansion and the existing structure on the adjacent lot or its required yard, whichever is closer.
Failure to meet each of these requirements shall be considered to be an increase in the noncompliance and therefore shall not be permitted.
82.3.2 Commercial. Degree of noncompliance shall be determined as the extent of the inability to meet a specific bulk requirement. No noncompliance shall be permitted to be increased where the bulk requirement which is currently being violated by a greater amount (i.e.: an addition to a building such that the existing 8 foot setback where 10 feet is required cannot be changed to 3 foot setback, thereby increasing the degree of noncompliance).
However, it shall not be deemed an increase in the noncompliance where an addition or extension continues the same degree of noncompliance (i.e.: an addi-tion to building such that the existing 8 foot setback where 10 foot is required con-tinues the building along the same 8 foot setback line).

GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING ZONING RELIEF
PAGE 89-1
SECTION 89  GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING ZONING RELIEF
89.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
It is hereby found that there are certain, specific uses which are a necessary part of an urban community such as West Haven. However, it is also found that these uses, if not properly regulated, would be detrimental to the safety, welfare, and health of the community and could have an adverse affect on the property values surround-ing them. The particular uses to which this Article applies are set forth herein and elsewhere in these Regulations.
It is, therefore, the purpose and intent of these Regulations and specifically this Article, to review the application to permit those uses on a lot-by-lot basis and where appro-priate, permit them only under certain limited circumstances in limited quantities, and with proper safeguard and controls based upon pre-established standards to assure a minimum of injury to surrounding property.
89.2 DEFINITIONS

89.4 INTENT
As provided in Section 8-6 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the strict enforcement of these Regulations whenever particular hardship is established. This power shall be used in only those circumstances wherein practical difficulty has made these regulations almost impossible and/or renders the property unusable.

VARIANCES
PAGE 90-1
SECTION 90  VARIANCES
90.1 INTENT
As provided in Section 8-6 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the strict enforcement of these Regulations whenever particular hardship is established.

SPECIAL USE EXCEPTIONS
PAGE 91-1
SECTION 91 SPECIAL USE EXCEPTIONS
91.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) shall have exclusive jurisdiction over those matters which are permitted under these Regulations by Special Use Exception and shall apply to those instances where the property is being requested to be used for specific, regulated purposes. It is recognized that occasion will arise wherein property may be requested to be put to use on a permanent or non-permanent basis where the use if not further regulated would not be in harmony with the Plan of Conservation and Development. It is also recognized that these special circum-stances are such as to be inappropriate for a request for a variance of these regulations, but such request may nonetheless be meritorious.
Within specific guidelines set forth in these Regulations the Board may issue a Special Use Exception which would permit a use of property which would not otherwise be permitted in the applicable zoning district. Further, the uses per-mitted by a Special Use Exception shall not be subject to creation or expansion by variance, but may be permitted only by the procedures provided herein.
91.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
In addition to those uses enumerated within the specific district regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a Special Use Exception subject to making the required findings and establishing appropriate safeguards and conditions for the following uses:
1. The granting of a Special Use Exception shall be recorded in the West Haven Land Records setting forth the use permitted, and condition attached by the Commission to the Use and the following limitation:
This Special Use Exception use shall not run with the land, but shall be personal to the current owner, shall expire upon the transfer of title or possession of the property, and shall continue to exist only so long as the Grantee utilizes the property in the manner and under the conditions as contained in this Grant of Special Use Exception. In making its decision on any application for a Special Use Exception, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make a determination as to each of the following:
1. The impact of the proposed use to the surrounding neighborhood and proper-ties, including the impact of the property values of the adjoining lots;
2. The impact of the proposed use on the health, safety, and welfare of the community, specifically the adjoining neighborhoods;
3. The impact of any potential traffic to be generated by the proposed use where appropriate;
4. The appropriateness of any such proposed use when located on a minor (local) street and adequacy of an on-site reservoir and/or parking space(s) to avoid traffic congestion;
5. The conformity of the petition with the specific guidelines, control and stand-ards for the Special Use Exception being requested as same are set forth in the specific zoning district regulations;
The Zoning Board of Appeals may only grant special use exceptions for uses listed for the specific zoning district. No Special Use Exceptions (other than those listed) may be granted for a use that is not permitted in a zoning district.
