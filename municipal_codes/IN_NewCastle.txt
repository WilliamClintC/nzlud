of the legislative body or of the context of the same ordinance.



(IC 1-1-4-1)



   (A)   Words and phrases shall be taken in their plain, ordinary, and
usual sense.  But technical words and phrases having a peculiar and
appropriate meaning in law shall be understood according to their technical
import.



(IC 1-1-4-1)



   (B)   As used in the code, unless the context otherwise requires:



      (1)   The singular includes the plural, and the plural
includes the singular.



      (2)   Words of one gender include the other genders.



      (3)   Words in the present tense include the future.



   (C)   Calendar; computation of time.



      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be
done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day;
except that when the last day falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal holiday,
or a day the office in which the act is to be done is closed during regular
business hours, then the act may be done on the next succeeding day which is
not a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal holiday, or a day on which the office is
closed.



      (2)   When a public office in which an act required by law is
to be performed is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes
the last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day,
then such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a
Sunday or a legal holiday.



      (3)   When a law is to take effect or become operative from
and after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.



      (4)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the
months from a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in
the concluding month as the day of the month from which the computation is
begun, unless there are not that many days in the concluding month, in which
case the period ends on the last day of that month.



      (5)   In all cases where the law requires any act to be done
in a reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time
or notice shall mean the time only as may be necessary for the prompt
performance of such duty or compliance with such notice.



   (D)   Act by assistants.  When a statute requires an act to be done

authorized agent or deputy.



(IC 1-1-4-1)

of terms is not to be limited to the class enumerated unless expressly so

more persons shall be construed as authority to a majority of such persons,
unless otherwise declared in the law giving such authority.



(IC 1-1-4-1)



   (G)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any
law which contains any express provision excluding such construction, or when

action, prosecution, or proceeding, existing at the time of the amendment or
repeal, unless otherwise expressly provided in the amending or repealing law.

      (1)   Affect any rights or liabilities which exist, have
accrued or have been incurred by virtue of the repealed provision;



      (2)   Affect an action or proceeding for the enforcement of

codified ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions
bearing the latest passage date shall prevail.  If the conflicting

to be consistent with the meaning or legal effect of the subject matter taken
as a whole.



('80 Code, § 1-3)



§ 10.09  SEVERABILITY.

conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same
effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as originally

regarding the nature or extent of such error.



('80 Code, § 1-6)

community service as ordered, or who was uncooperative or refused to perform
duties as instructed.



      (4)   Upon completion of community service, as certified by
the Building Commissioner, of the hours assigned by the Court, the Court
shall show the penalty, fine, or finding satisfied in full.



      (5)   In considering whether community service should be
offered to the offending party in lieu of a monetary fine, the Court shall
consider the financial ability of the offending party to pay the penalty, the
nature of the offense, the nature of the community service to be performed,
the age of the defendant, the offending party's employment status, and all
other factors surrounding the nature of the offense.

ordinance over the veto; and

is being suspended, or that he will not receive a permanent appointment.  If

leave.

of his current address.  A member shall be informed of his reinstatement by

§ 36.22  NEPOTISM AND CONFLICTS IN CONTRACTING POLICY ADOPTED.



   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a
policy of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city and
in contracting with the city in order to continue to be able to provide local
government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws
effective July 1, 2012, known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.



   (B)   On July 1, 2012 the city shall have a nepotism and a
contracting with a unit policy that complies with the minimum requirements of
IC 36-1-20.2 (hereinafter "Nepotism Policy") and IC 36-1-21 (hereinafter
"Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy") and implementation will begin.



   (C)   The City Nepotism Policy is hereby established effective July
1, 2012 by adopting the minimum requirements provisions of IC 36-1-20.2, and
including all future supplements and amendments thereto which become law from
time to time, and making them a part hereof as if fully set out herein.  In

Res. 061812-1.



   (D)   The City Contracting with a Unit by a Relative Policy is

   (E)   The city finds that both IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21
specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are "more stringent or
detailed" and that more detailed are necessary.



   (F)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative
body cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority
of a majority of the body and therefore without such authority by the

36-4-6-11, IC 36-5-2-9.4.)



   (G)   The city finds that a single member of governing bodies with
authority over employees in the city cannot act for the governing body to
make work assignments, compensation, grievances, advancement or a performance
evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority the single member will not be in the direct line of
supervision.



   (H)   All elected and appointed officials and employees of the city
are hereby directed to cooperate fully in the implementation of the policies
created by this section and demonstrating compliance with these same policies.



   (I)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the Nepotism Policy is a
violation and may result in the discipline, including termination, of an
employee or a transfer from the direct line of supervision or other curative
action.  An elected or appointed official of the city who fails to abide by
or cooperate with the implementation, with the compliance and with mandated
certifications of either the Nepotism Policy may be subject to action allowed
by law.



   (J)   Failure to abide by or cooperate with the implementation,
compliance and certifications connected with the Contracting with Unit by a
Relative Policy is a violation and may result in the discipline, including
termination, of an employee or a curative action.  An elected or appointed
official of the city who fails to abide by or cooperate with the
implementation, with the compliance and with mandated certifications of
either the Nepotism Policy or the Contracting with Unit by a Relative Policy
may be subject to action allowed by law.



   (K)   The policies created by this section are hereby directed to be
implemented by any of the following actions:



      (1)   Posting a copy of this section in its entirety in at
least one of the locations in the city where it posts employer posters or
other notices to its employees;



      (2)   Providing a copy of this section to its employees and
elected and appointed officials;



      (3)   Providing or posting a notice of the adoption of this
section and any such other action or actions that would communicate the
policies established by this section to its employees and elected and
appointed officials.  Upon any of taking these actions these policies are
deemed implemented by the city.



   (L)   A copy of the provisions of IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21
effective July 1, 2012, are attached to Res. 061812-1 and incorporated herein
by reference.



   (M)   Two copies of IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, and as supplemented
or amended, are on file in the office of the Clerk or Clerk-Treasurer for the
city for public inspection as may be required by IC 36-1-5-4.

or lien release but rather that such charge be passed through to the property
owner.  The civil city and the utility shall prepare a schedule of all lien
filing costs and fees and release costs and fees.  This schedule shall be
approved by the Board of Public Works and Safety at a regular public meeting
of said Board and be available for public inspection.  The Board of Public

(Ord. 3672, passed 3-18-13)



§ 37.06  CREDIT CARD USE.



   (A)   The Clerk-Treasurer may apply for a credit card from a
financial institution.  Said credit card's maximum total limit should be no
greater than $10,000.  The maximum single purchase on said card should not
exceed $2,500.  The card should be issued to the City of New Castle and the
Clerk-Treasurer or her deputy shall be the officials responsible for its use
in accordance with this section.  Said account should not be used as a
method for incurring debt and the outstanding balance must be paid in full
upon receipt of the monthly statement.



   (B)   The purpose of the credit card is for city wide use so that
small purchases in amounts less than $2,500 may be made from merchants
demanding immediate payment.  After the card is used, it must immediately be
returned to the Clerk-Treasurer or his or her Deputy for safe keeping.  The
Clerk-Treasurer or his or her Deputy shall maintain an accounting system or
log which will include the names of the individuals requesting usage of the
card, their position, estimated amounts to be charged, fund and account
numbers to be charged, and the date the card was delivered to the individual
requesting usage and returned.



   (C)   The use of credit cards shall not be considered as a bypass to
the normal city's accounting system.  Purchase orders must continue to be
issued so that the Clerk-Treasurer's office has a means to encumber and track
appropriations so that officials may be provided with timely and accurate
accounting information and the accounting system might be monitored. 
Payment should only be made after those procedures necessary to pay any other
claims are made.  Supporting documents such paid bills and receipts must be
available.  Any interest or penalty incurred due to late payment or failure
to furnish proper documentation by an officer or employee shall be the
responsibility of that officer or employee.  However this does not restrict
the ability of the city to pay properly authorized annual credit card fees.



   (D)   In all respects, use of the credit card must comply with
guidelines established by the State Board of Accounts and good public
accounting practices.



   (E)   Nothing herein shall release the city from complying with
state purchasing laws.

apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   "TANGIBLE ASSETS."  Assets that can be observed by one or more of the

buildings, improvements other than buildings, machinery and equipment).



   "CAPITAL OUTLAYS."  Expenditures which benefit both the current and
future fiscal periods.  This includes costs of acquiring land or structures;

outright, as easements, or right-of-way for infrastructure.  Examples of
infrastructures are roads and streets, street lighting systems, bridges,
overpasses, sidewalks, curbs, parking meters, street signs, viaducts,
wharves, and storm water collection.



      (3)   Original cost of land will include the full value given
to the seller, including relocation, legal services incidental to the

contractors and/or city works (salary and benefits)), which makes such
equipment operable for its intended purpose will be capitalized.



      (3)   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery and
equipment will be capitalized only if the result meets all of the following
conditions:



         (a)   Total costs exceeds $250;



         (b)   The useful life is extended two or more years; and

value and less than the fair market value.



      (4)   Examples include:



         (a)   A work truck being equipped with screens, lights,
or radios for use as a single unit throughout its life expectancy is
considered one unit.



         (b)   If police cars are constantly changing light bars
or radios to other vehicles, the city will capitalize each piece of equipment
separately, if it meets the required dollar amount.



         (c)   A department's computer (CPU, monitor, keyboard,
and printer) is considered one unit.



         (d)   A department will record donated machinery and
equipment at fair market value on the date of transfer with any associated
costs.

no subcategories for tracking the cost of attachments.  Example of
attachments are roofs, heating, cooling, plumbing, lighting, or sprinkler

      (5)   A department will record donated buildings at fair
market value on the date of transfer with any associated costs.



      (6)   Purchases made using federal or state funding will

      (3)   Improvements do not include roads, streets, or assets or
assets that are of value only to the public.  For example, Main Street is a
public street with greatest value to the public.  Roads or drives upon
city-owned land that provide support to our facilities are assets. A sidewalk
down the road for public enjoyment is an infrastructure improvement and is
not capitalized.  However, sidewalks installed upon city-owned land for use
by the public and for support of our facility are capital assets.



      (4)   This city will capitalize new improvements or
renovations to existing improvements other than buildings only if the result

         (a)   The total cost exceeds $5,000;



         (b)   The asset's useful life is extended two or more

attribute.



   "ENTERPRISE FUNDS." 



      (1)   Those funds used to account for operations that are
financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprise -

depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a
continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or
where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues
earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital
maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other
purposes.



      (2)   The enterprise funds of the city shall include the
municipally owned water and sewer utilities.  Operation of these utilities

§ 37.21  RECORDING AND ACCOUNTING.



   (A)   The city and its various departments shall classify capital
expenditures as capital outlays within the fund from which the expenditure
was made in accordance with the chart of accounts of the cities and towns
accounting manual.  The cost of property, plant and equipment includes all
expenditures necessary to put the asset into position and ready for use. 
For purposes of recording fixed assets of the city and its departments, the
valuation of assets shall be based on historical cost or where the historical
cost is indeterminable, by estimation for those assets in existence.



   (B)   The city's municipally owned utilities shall record
acquisition of fixed assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  When an asset is purchased for cash, the acquisition is simply
recorded at the amount of cash paid, including all outlays relating to its
purchase and preparation for intended use.  Assets may be acquired under a
number of other arrangements including:



      (1)   Assets acquired for a lump-sum purchase price;



      (2)   Purchase on deferred payment contract;

   (A)   Upon receipt by the city of a written request by an owner, to
extend city services to the owner's real estate, when such real estate is
located outside of the city's then current corporate limits, such request
shall be determined in light of the following:



      (1)   Services to areas contiguous to the corporate boundaries
of the city, which are capable of being annexed, may not receive the
extension of any city service including water utilities and sewer utilities
unless the owner petitions the city to be annexed and said petition is
granted and the real estate annexed by the city becoming a part thereof.



      (2)   Real estate which is not contiguous to the city or the
city is precluded from approving a voluntary petition to annex same or if the
real estate cannot be annexed due to the filing of a remonstrance against
annexation by other property owners thus preventing said real estate from
being annexed, may receive city services only if the owner prior to the
receipt of any city service, enters into a contract with the city for the
provision of such services. Said contract must provide for the following:



         (a)   The owner of the real estate receiving the
services must agree in the contract to waive and forever relinquish their
right and their successors in title's right to remonstrate against pending or
future annexations by the city of the area served, and must further agree to
voluntarily petition the city to annex the area served as soon as said area
is capable of being annexed by voluntary annexation, and



         (b)   The owner will pay to the city an amount annually
in lieu of taxation which will reimburse the city for the cost of providing
services, the costs of increasing the capacity of the city to provide
services, the tax revenue which the city would have received from all sources

city a bond in favor of the city in an amount to be determined based upon the
cost of construction, which will provide for the correction of any defects or
maintenance which might be required due to construction or design failures
which would occur during the first three years after the dedication of the
system to the city by the owner and its acceptance by the city into its
utility system, and



         (d)   That the Board of Public Works of the city shall
be responsible for drafting the contract and determining the amounts paid
based upon the parameters established by this subchapter. In so doing, the

abatements and other industrial incentives might have in determining the
amount set forth above. In the event such industrial incentives are
considered to be in the best interests of the city, the Board of Public Works
must at the time the contract is presented to the Common Council by
resolution for approval, indicate in that resolution the nature of the
industrial incentives, attach as an exhibit those documents which would
normally be considered by the legislative body in considering industrial
incentives which would include job creation figures, capital improvements,
and the reason for requesting the incentives, said incentives may not be
considered if same would not be available to the development under the then
applicable laws of the State of Indiana, and



         (e)   The Board of Public Works shall also negotiate
with the owner/developer to determine which city services are to be provided
under the contract, and

request to terminate, must be made 90 days prior to the end of the contract
term. Said request must be made in writing by the owner and delivered to the
Clerk-Treasurer of the city and to the Mayor of the city. In the event such
request is not made, the parties shall agree in writing, to extend the
contract for an additional four year term. This process shall continue each
and every four years until the owner requests the termination of services, or
refuses to renew the contract. In the event the parties desire to alter or
amend any contract provision, such changes must be approved by Council in the
same manner the contract was approved. All contract extensions must be in
writing, be recordable, and be approved by a resolution of the Council. The
city may terminate the contract if the owner is in default in any term of the
contract for a period in excess of 30 days. Prior to the termination of the
contract, the city must provide the owner with 60 day notice of termination
giving the owner 30 days to cure any act of default. In the event any payment

   (A)   The ordinance attached to Ord. 3657 which sets forth uniform
requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works for the city and
enables the city to comply with all applicable and state and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 USC §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403), is hereby passed and adopted as
the City of New Castle Sewer Use Ordinance.  The body and contents of said
ordinance are attached to Ord. 3657 in their entirety and incorporated herein
as if set forth in full.



   (B)   The Board of Public Works and Safety must adopt an Industrial
Pretreatment Program Enforcement Response Plan (ERP).  This plan should
provide a protocol for responding to industrial pretreatment violations
consistently and systematically.  The ERP adopted by the Board must contain
a provision for the notification of industry explaining how the publicly
owned treatment works (POTW) responds to pretreatment violations.  It should
further set up a method by which instances of non-compliance will be
investigated, the enforcement actions to be taken by the POTW, and identify
the officials responsible for taking that action, and reflect the POTW's
primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements
and standards.  The ERP should provide for consistent enforcement response
for similar violations and circumstances, describe violations, define the
range of appropriate enforcement actions based upon the nature and severity
of the violations and other relevant factors and identify those responsible
for finalizing enforcement responses.

§ 50.113  DETERMINATION OF QUANTITY OF WATER DISCHARGED INTO SYSTEM.



   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; further,
as is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper
allowances in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on
the records to be consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of
the city that such quantities do not enter the sanitary sewerage system.



   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a
user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and the water
used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a
water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall
be otherwise measured or determined by the city.  In order to ascertain the
rate or charge provided in this subchapter, the owner or other interested
party shall at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.



   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is a user
of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is
a user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or
is measured by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water
used shall be otherwise  measured  or  determined by the city.  In order
to ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties
shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.



   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real
estate, or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water, or other liquids
into the city's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are
users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter,
then in each such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used
shall be averaged for each user and the base charge and the flow rates and
charges shall apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of
real estate, or buildings served through the single-water meter.



   (D)   In order that the single-family domestic and residential users
of sewage service shall not be penalized for sprinkling lawns during the
summer months of July, August, and September the billing for sewage service
for residences or domestic users for the months shall be based upon the water
usage for the previous months of January, February, and March.  In the event
the water usage for the previous months is greater than the water usage for
the summer months, then the billing for sewage services shall be computed on
the actual water used in the month for which the sewage service bill is being
rendered.  Domestic or residential sewage service as applicable to the
sprinkling rate shall apply to each lot, parcel of real estate, or building
which is occupied and used as a single-family residence.  The sprinkling
rate shall not apply to any premises which are partially or wholly used for
commercial or industrial purposes.  In the event a portion of such premises
shall be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the
privilege of separating the water service so that the residential portion of
the premises is served through a separate meter and in such case the water
usage as registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises
used for residential purposes would qualify under the sprinkling rate.



   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and uses
water in excess of 50,000 cubic feet per month, and it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water
meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then
the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination
of sewage discharge.

§ 50.114  BASING CHARGES ON STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF WASTES.



   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges 
not  only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the
stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is required to treat
and dispose of.  The city shall require the user to determine the strength
and content of all sewage and wastes discharges, either directly or
indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such method
as the city may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper charge.  The
user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all
times.



   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 200 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended
solids of 250 milligrams per liter of fluid, phosphorous of ten milligrams
per liter of fluid, or oil and grease of 100 milligrams per liter of fluid. 
Additional charges for treating stronger than normal domestic waste shall be
made as provided in § 50.112(A)(3).



   (B)   The determination of suspended solids, phosphorous, and
five-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand contained in the waste shall be in
accordance with the latest copy of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water, Sewage and Industrial Wastes," as written by the American Public
Health Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water
Pollution Control Federation, and in conformance with "Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants," Regulation CFR Part
136, published in the Federal Register on October 16, 1973.

§ 50.115  BILLING AND COLLECTION.



   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the
city in the manner provided by law and ordinance.



   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and
billed monthly.



   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability
in the event payment is not made as herein required. The owners of properties
served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the right to
examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of determining
whether bills have been paid by such tenants, provided that such examination
shall be made at the office at which the records are kept and during the
hours that such office is open for business.

§ 50.116  ANNUAL REVIEW.



   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may
remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing
services  to the various users or user classes, the city shall cause a study
to be made within a reasonable period of time following the first 12 months
of operation, following the date on which this subchapter goes into effect. 
Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs
associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial
users, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the
various users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works and
the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation and
maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements, and capital
improvements to the waste treatment systems.



   (B)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable period of
time following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a similar
study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity of the
rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis.  The studies
shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city, or by a firm of
certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms
shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall
determine to be best under the circumstances.

§ 50.117  ENFORCEMENT BY CITY.



   (A)   The city shall make and enforce such bylaws and regulations as
may be deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient management of
the city's sewerage system, pumping stations, and sewage treatment works, for
the construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewerage
system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating, and refunding of such
rates and charges.



   (B)   The city is authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes into the
city's sewage system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful to the
operation of the sewage treatment works of the city or to require methods
affecting pretreatment of the wastes to comply with the pretreatment
standards included in the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit issued to the sewage works.

(Ord. 2318, passed 10-15-79)



§ 50.119  SPECIAL RATE CONTRACTS.



   The Board is further authorized to enter into special rate contracts 
with  customers  of the sewage works where clearly definable reductions in
cost to the sewage works can be determined, and such reduction shall be
limited to such reduced costs.  Such proposed contracts shall be subject to
the approval of the Common Council of the city.



(Ord. 2318, passed 10-15-79)



§ 50.120  SECURITY DEPOSIT.



   (A)   A security deposit shall be collected upon the opening of a
new account with the Water Pollution Control Department. Said security
deposit shall be as follows:



      (1)   For all residential accounts - $50.



      (2)   For all other accounts (which would include commercial
and industrial accounts) - $100.



   (B)   Said deposit shall be maintained in a separate account and
returned to the customer upon closing said account, provided the account
balance is current and the city’s property has not been damaged. In the
event of a delinquent account at the time of account termination or damage to
city property, said deposit shall be set off against said balance due. The
city shall be free to pursue the remaining sum due, if any exists, by
utilizing all remedies available to it.



   (C)   The customer opening the account may avoid the assessment of
said security deposit by providing the city with a copy of a warranty deed or
other proof of ownership, showing the property served to be owned by the
customer in whose name the account is opened and to whom the billing is
directed.

offending party shall immediately cease and desist from such conduct and
bring the project into compliance with the specifications set out above or
obtain a "finding of necessity" and further the violating utility shall be
subject to fine of $25 for such violation. A new violation shall be
considered to occur every 24-hour period that the aforementioned separation
is not maintained. Further, the violating third-party utility shall be
responsible for reimbursement to the city for any costs incurred by it that
would not otherwise occur as a result of the violation of said spacing
requirement.

be rendered monthly, in accordance with the regular sewage utility billing
cycle, by the utility billing division of the city for all properties subject
to the fee. Bills shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner
and subject to the same penalties as set forth for the sewer utility. Any
partial payment of a combined utility bill shall be applied first to the
stormwater utility user fee. Any unpaid stormwater utility user fees shall
constitute a lien on such property except the liens of state, county and
municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with the lien of such state, county
and municipal taxes. Such lien, when delinquent for more than 30 days, may be
foreclosed by the city in the manner provided by the laws of Indiana for the
foreclosure of mortgages on real property.



   (B)   For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for
other city services, the stormwater utility user fee shall be included in the
monthly sewage utility bill rendered to the established customer.



   (C)   For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other
city services, the bill or statement for the stormwater utility user fee
shall be sent to the stormwater utility user as determined from the tax
rolls. The authorized official may render annual, semiannual, or monthly
billings, to be billed in arrears, to coincide with the property tax
schedule, on such properties if determined to be the best interest of the
city.



   (D)   The owner of a property is ultimately responsible for all fees
imposed under this subchapter.



(Ord. 3456, passed 12-19-05)



§ 53.12 PERIODIC LEGISLATIVE RATE REVIEW.



   In hopes of minimizing the possibility of infrequent but higher rate
increases and the resulting "rate shock" to the ratepayer, the Board of
Public Works shall provide the City Council with a rate study showing the
financial condition of the utility and a recommendation regarding the rates
charged no less than every four years. The next such study shall be provided
on or before January 30, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be reviewed by
Council on the 30th day of January, every four years.

when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters
of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.



   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.



      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this
subchapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will
notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator
may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and
hearing.

§ 53.27 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.



   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the city authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of discharges to
the MS4.



(Ord. 3410, passed 11-1-04)



§ 53.28 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that
have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.



   (B)   Access to facilities.



      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this subchapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with, this subchapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.



      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



      (3)   The city has the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.



      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to
install, at the discharger's cost, monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
properly calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.



      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of
this subchapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this subchapter.



      (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this subchapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.

§ 53.29 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for activities, operations, or facilities which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters
of the United States. Absence of specific requirements or standards does not
alleviate the responsibility of the discharger to comply with the
requirements of this subchapter and other applicable state and federal laws.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be
part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

The cemetery expressly disclaims liability for any injuries sustained by
anyone violating this rule.



      (2)   Persons visiting the cemetery or attending funerals are
strictly prohibited from picking flowers, wild or cultivated, breaking or
injuring any tree, shrub, or plant, or from writing upon, defacing or

      (5)   Decorating of gravesites.



         (a)   The installation, fencing, hedging border or
enclosures of any kind around a burial lot or gravesite is prohibited. The
placement of gravel, mulch, sand or other such materials shall not be
permitted.



         (b)   No item shall be placed on the ground surrounding
the gravesite foundation between the dates of April 1 and November 30, same
being the mowing season of the cemetery, with the exception of permitted
items mentioned below regarding special holidays. The only items permitted
during the mowing season shall include vases that are integral to the
monument and placed on the monument foundation, monument saddles, and small
statues permanently affixed to the concrete foundation or memorial base.
Further memory lights shall also be permitted during the mowing season,
lights made of metal may be placed on the ground as close to the base of the
monument as possible so as not to restrict or hinder the mowing of the
graves.  Lights made from any other materials (i.e. plastics) shall only be
permitted if placed on the actual gravestone or memorial.  In no event shall
the placing of a memory light at a gravesite require special maintenance or
care or cause difficulty in mowing or maintaining the gravesite or create a
safety hazard for employees.



         (c)   Vases, urns, and angel statues shall not exceed 36
inches but may be placed at the site of a headstone on the monument
foundation provided there is sufficient space for same. Such vases and/or
urns must be placed on cement or a concrete foundation which are flush with
the ground and not in the mowing path or on the base which the headstone
rests upon. Such vases and/or urns or statues shall be reasonably secure to
prevent becoming dislodged or causing a safety hazard to employees performing
mowing duties. Foot stones must be flush with the ground so that they may be
mowed over. No glass or breakable container shall be permitted. No metal
cans, wire hooks or spikes shall be permitted.



         (d)   1.   Flowers and decorations may be placed on

               ii.   Mother's Day; and



               iii.   Father's Day.



            2.   All such flowers and decorations placed on

seventh calendar day following Memorial Day and no later than two calendar
days following Easter, Mother's Day, and Father's Day. Shepherd's crooks
shall not be decorated with any material, including ribbons, balloons and
other such items. Shepherd's crooks shall not exceed a height of 54 inches

be discarded after the 30 calendar days holding period. All flowers and
decorations permitted for special holidays, as addressed above will be
removed by the cemetery personnel after the allowable time has expired if
they have not been removed by the owner.



         (f)   Grave blankets shall be allowed on gravesites
between November 30 and March 1. All hooks or spike devices used to secure
the blanket to the ground shall be secured to the blanket so that same may
not become dislodged from the blanket or fall loose upon cemetery grounds.
Such method of securing the blanket to the ground shall not include chain,
wire or other materials which are metallic or would cause a danger to those
maintaining the property.



         (g)   1.   If a gravesite is unmarked and no monument
appears thereon, the grave marker as provided by the funeral service will be
allowed plus one of the following:



               i.   A temporary cross;



               ii.   An urn with flowers; or



               iii.   An appropriate statue.



            2.   None of the above shall be more than 36
inches in height and must be removed when the permanent grave marker is
placed. All such urns or statues shall be placed on a flat concrete slab and
secured so same may not be dislodged. All rules regarding special holidays
(Easter, Memorial Day, Mother's Day, and Father's Day) shall remain in effect
for unmarked graves as well marked graves.



         (h)   The cemetery superintendent shall prepare an
informational packet which includes these rules and all other rules
associated with the Westlawn Addition to the South Mound Cemetery. These
shall be made available to members of the public upon request and shall be
delivered to any purchaser of a gravesite at the time of said purchase.

decorations and discard same and shall have no responsibility to the owner or
any third person for said items improperly placed on gravesites.



      (6)   It is of the utmost importance that there should be

      (7)   Special cases may arise in which the literal enforcement
of a rule may impose unnecessary hardship.  The superintendent, therefore,
reserves the right to make exceptions, suspensions, or modifications of any
of these rules and regulations, without notice, when in the judgment of the
superintendent such action appears necessary; and such temporary exception,
suspension, or modification shall in no way be construed as affecting the
general application of such rules and regulations.



      (8)   No lot shall be used for any other purpose than for the
burial of the human dead.



      (9)   The management will take all reasonable precautions to
protect lot owners, and the property rights of lot owners, within the
cemetery, from loss or damage; but the management distinctly disclaims all
responsibility for loss or damage caused beyond its reasonable control, and,
especially, from damage caused by the elements, an act of God, thieves,
vandals, malicious mischief makers, explosions, unavoidable accidents,
invasions, insurrections, riots, or order of any military or civil authority,
whether the damage be direct or collateral, other than as herein provided.



      (10)   It is the duty of the lot owner to notify the
management of any change in his address.  Notice sent to a lot owner at the
last address on file in the office of the cemetery shall be sufficient and
proper legal notification.



      (11)   The general care of the cemetery is assumed by the city
and includes the cutting of the grass at reasonable intervals, the raking and
cleaning of the grounds, and the pruning of shrubs and trees that may be
placed by the management; meaning and intending the general preservation of
the lots and grounds, walkways, boundaries, and structures, to the end that
the grounds shall remain and be reasonably cared for as cemetery grounds,
forever.



      (12)   The general care assumed by the cemetery shall in no
case mean the maintenance, repair, or replacement of any memorial, tomb, or
mausoleum placed or erected upon lots, nor the doing of any special or
unusual work in the cemetery, including work caused by impoverishment of the
soil; nor does it mean the reconstruction of any marble, granite, bronze, or
concrete work on any section or lot, or any portion thereof in the cemetery,
caused by the elements, an act of God, thieves, vandals, malicious mischief
makers, explosions, unavoidable accidents, invasions, insurrections, riots,
or order of any military or civil authority, whether the damage be direct or
collateral, other than as herein provided.

      (16)   The right is reserved by the management to insist upon
at least 24 hours notice prior to any interment for normal working hours

could possibly take longer; management will always try to work with the
funeral home making arrangements to keep all delays at a minimum.



      (17)   All charges must be paid before interment.  Burial
permits must also be in order and in possession of cemetery before interment.

all interments, disinterments, and removals are made subject to the orders
and laws of the properly constituted public authorities.



      (19)   The cemetery will not be responsible for any order
given by telephone, or for any mistake occurring from the want of precise and
proper instructions as to the particular space, lot, and section, size of
grave, where interment is desired.



      (20)   The management reserves the right to remove all floral
designs, flowers, weeds, trees, shrubs, plants, or herbage of any kind, from
the cemetery as soon as they become unsightly, dangerous, detrimental, or
diseased, or when they do not conform to the standards prescribed by the
management.



      (21)   The management will not be liable for floral pieces,
baskets or frames in which such floral pieces are attached beyond the
acceptance of such floral pieces for funeral services held in the cemetery.

respective lots subject to the approval of the management.  All memorials
shall be set on foundations built of concrete, and of the size and depth

business, within the cemetery, is not permitted.



      (25)   Persons engaged in erecting monuments or other
structures, are prohibited from attaching ropes to monuments, trees, and
shrubs, or from scattering their material over adjoining lots, or from
leaving their material on the grounds longer than is absolutely necessary. 
They must do as little injury to the grass, trees, and shrubs as possible,
and must remove all debris and restore the ground and sod to its original
condition.



      (26)   When heavy material is to be moved over paths or grass,

condition.



      (28)   While a funeral or interment is being conducted nearby,
all work of any description must cease.

all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney fees, and may further
seek to have a lien placed upon the real estate which has benefitted by the
city’s solid waste disposal service in the same manner as other sewage
works liens are statutorily imposed upon real property.

§ 96.02  PURPOSE AND COVERAGE.



   (A)   It is the public policy of the city to provide all of its
citizens equal opportunity for education, employment, access to public
conveniences and accommodations and acquisition through purchase or rental or
real property including but not limited to housing, and to eliminate
segregation or separation based solely on race, religion, color, sex,
handicap, national origin, or ancestry, since such segregation is an
impediment to equal opportunity.  Equal education and employment
opportunities and equal access to and use of public accommodations and equal
opportunity for acquisition of real property are declared to be civil rights.



   (B)   The practice of denying these rights to properly qualified
persons by reason of the race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national
origin, or ancestry of such person is contrary to the principles of freedom
and equality of opportunity and is a burden to the objectives of the public
policy of the city and shall be considered as discriminatory practices.  The
purpose of this chapter is the promotion of equal opportunity without regard
to race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, or ancestry through
reasonable methods.



   (C)   It is also the public policy of the city to protect employers,
labor organizations, employment agencies, property owners, real estate
brokers, builders, and lending institutions from unfounded charges of
discrimination.



   (D)   It is declared to be contrary to the public policy of the city
and an unlawful practice for any person, for profit, to induce or attempt to
induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding
the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons
of a particular race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, or
ancestry.

   Any contractor, prime- or sub- that is paid in part or in whole, with
funds obtained from the federal government pursuant to a grant, contract,
loan, insurance, or guarantee or undertaken pursuant to any federal program
involving such grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee shall
incorporate or cause to be incorporated into any contract for construction
work or modification thereof, the equal opportunity clause as defined in HUD
Regulations At. 24 CFR 130.15(B) and shall file and implement a Section 3

   (B)   Upon the failure or refusal of an owner to pay the same upon
the demand of the City Clerk-Treasurer, the city may bring an action by its
attorney, in any court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose such lien, as a

   (A)   The sum of $15,000 shall be deposited by the Clerk-Treasurer
in the “Sidewalk Construction, Repair and Replacement Non-Reverting Fund”
as previously established by the Common Council.



   (B)   The Board of Works shall utilize this sum to fund a sidewalk
improvement program. The Board of Works shall make it known that the city is
providing a match of not greater than half the cost of a repair project or
$500, whichever is less, to property owners who wish to make improvements,
repair, replace or maintain their sidewalks.



   (C)   Any property owner wishing to take advantage of this program
must submit an application to the Board of Works. That application must
include a photograph of the sidewalk to be repaired, a statement of the work
to be performed, and an estimate of the cost of labor and materials.



   (D)   The Board of Works shall prepare a form to be utilized by the
citizens for application for reimbursement funds pursuant to this section.

take place.



   (F)   Upon receipt of the application, the Building Inspector shall
go to the site and make a pre-construction inspection of the site. Thereafter
he or she will report to the Board of Works which will then consider the
application. If the application is approved, the applicant will be notified
in writing of the approval and the amount that will be paid upon completion
of the work referred to in the application. After completion of the work, and
prior to payment, the applicant will provide the Board of Works with proof of
payment for the improvements or repairs made. Further, the Building
Instructor will complete a post- construction inspection. Provided the
sidewalk passes the city inspection, and all work has been paid, an amount
equal to that which has been previously approved by the Board will be made
payable to the applicant.



   (G)   The city will not be a party to any contract with contractors
or third-party for repairs. The city does not warrant the work that will be
performed. This provides reimbursement of sums mentioned above to the
property owner after work has been completed.



   (H)   All work performed must meet city specifications, be
preapproved by the Building Inspector, and receive final approval and
inspection from the Building Inspector after completion of the work.



   (I)   Once an application is granted and the owner receives written
notice of same, the applicant will have 40 days to complete the work and
request reimbursement. After the 40 days, the city reimbursement offer shall
expire and those funds will be made available to other applicants. Upon
exhaustion of the $15,000 referred to herein above, this reimbursement
program shall expire unless funded by further appropriations of the Common
Council.



   (J)   This Sidewalk Reimbursement Program shall not be available to
any elected official of the city or any of the immediate family members of
said elected officials.



   (K)   An applicant may only apply for this grant once in any four
year period.

portions thereof, due to all dead or live loads, is more than one and
one-half times the working stress or stresses allowed for new buildings of
similar structure, purpose, or location.



      (4)   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire,
earthquake, wind, flood, or by any other cause, to such an extent that the
structural strength or stability thereof is materially less than it was
before such catastrophe and is less than the minimum requirements for new
buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location.



      (5)   Whenever any portion, member or appurtenance thereof is
likely to fail, to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby
injure persons or damage property.



      (6)   Whenever any portion of a building, or any member,
appurtenance, or ornamentation on the exterior thereof is not of sufficient
strength or stability or is not so anchored, attached, or fastened in place

specified for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, or location
without exceeding the working stresses permitted for such buildings.



      (7)   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped,
buckled, or settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions
have materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in
the case of similar new construction.



      (8)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, because of dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty
construction; the removal, movement or instability of the ground necessary
for the purpose of supporting such building; the deterioration, decay, or
inadequacy of its foundation; or any other cause, is likely to partially or
completely collapse.



      (9)   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is
being used.



      (10)   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical
structural members list, lean or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line
passing thought the center of gravity does not fall inside the middle
one-third of the base.



      (11)   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the
foundation, shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting
member or members, or 50% damage or deterioration of its non-supporting
members, enclosing or outside walls or coverings.



      (12)   Whenever the building or structure has become so
damaged by fire, wind, earthquake, or flood or has become so dilapidated or
deteriorated so as to become an attractive nuisance to children, or freely
accessible to persons for the purpose of committing unlawful acts.



      (13)   Whenever any building or structure has been
constructed, exists, or is maintained in violation of any specific

   (B)   The zone map, which accompanies and is hereby declared to be a
part of this chapter, shows the boundaries of and the area covered by the
districts.  Notations, references, indications, and other matters shown on

§ 152.16  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.



   (A)   In determining the boundaries of districts, and establish-ing
the regulations applicable to each district, due and careful consideration
has been given to existing conditions, the character of buildings erected in
each district, the most desirable use for which the land in each district may
be adapted, and the conservation of property values throughout the
jurisdictional area.  Where uncertainty exists as to the exact boundaries of
any district as shown on the zone map, the following rules shall apply:



      (1)   In unsubdivided areas, or where a district boundary
subdivides a lot, the exact location of the boundary shall be determined by
use of the scale of the zone map.



      (2)   In the case of further uncertainty, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall interpret the intent of the zone map as to the location of the
boundary in question.



   (B)   Whenever any street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way,
waterway, or other similar area is vacated by proper authority, the districts
adjoining each side of the street, alley, public way, railroad right-of-way,
waterway, or similar areas shall be extended automatically to the center of
the vacation and all area included in the vacation shall then and thenceforth
be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.



(Ord. 2281, passed 4-2-79)



§ 152.17  DISTRICTS DEFINED.



   The districts identified above are described as follows:



   (A)   Residence districts.  Five districts, R1, R2, R3, RS, and MHP
are established for residential use in conformity with the types of
neighborhoods which have occurred and are likely to develop in the areas so
designated in the zone map.  The districts differ primarily with respect to
requirements of lot size, building ground floor area, and the number of
families which may be housed in one building.  The specific requirements for
each residence district are shown in Appendix A following this chapter. 
Certain non-residential  special exceptions may be permitted in these
districts, as described more fully in Appendix G and Appendix H following
this chapter.  A brief description follows:



      (1)   Rl.  This is a single-family dwelling district which
includes the major part of the jurisdictional area inside the city where the
established pattern of development indicates stable development of that
character.  The minimum lot and building areas required in this district
recognize current desirable residential construction practices.



      (2)   R2.  This district permits single- and two-family
dwellings.



      (3)   R3.  This district permits single- two-, and
multiple-family dwellings. The R2 and R3 Districts include the more densely
built-up sections of the city close to the central business area where a
number of such uses now exist and others are likely to occur through the
conversion of existing large residential structures. Minimum lot area and
building area requirements in the R3 District are the lowest contained in
this chapter.



      (4)   RS.  Included in this district is the large part of the
jurisdictional area outside the city subject to residential use where no
clear pattern of development is evident.  While the district will be used
primarily for single-family dwellings,  two-family and multi-family
buildings will be permitted on a density-of-use basis, with the minimum lot
size being increased for each additional dwelling unit included in a
building.  The RS requirements as to minimum size of lots are greater than
those specified for the other residence districts.



      (5)   Mobile Home Park.  This district provides suitable
locations for higher density concentration of single-family dwellings
characteristic of mobile home parks and promotes quality design, landscaping,
and standards of building and grounds maintenance.  The regulations of this
section shall complement and be applied in addition to the State Board of
Health Regulations HSE 21-R, and amendments thereto.



   (B)   Commercial districts - Four districts, Cl, C2, C3, and C4, are
established to meet the specific requirements for the several classes of
business uses needed to give adequate service throughout the jurisdictional
area as related to present and future development. Single-, two-family, and
multi-family dwellings are permitted uses in all of the commercial districts
except the C3 and C4, which are designated for the shopping center and
service center types of development.  All residential uses in the commercial
districts are subject to the requirements of Appendix A following this
chapter.  The specific requirements for business uses in these districts are
given in Appendices B, C, and D following this chapter.  For special
exceptions permitted in the commercial districts see Appendices G and H
following this chapter.  A brief description of the commercial districts
follows:



      (1)   Cl.  This district is designed and located in
neighborhoods to accommodate the primary shopping and service needs of the
locality.  Although limited in area occupied, these districts are important
to the economic welfare of the community in placing "convenience" and
"impulse" goods shops close to the consumer. The local business uses defined
in § 152.26 are permitted in all commercial districts.



      (2)   C2.  This is a general business district providing for
all types of business and service uses including warehouse and storage
facilities as well as some light industrial operations.



      (3)   C3.  This district is provided to meet the need for
retail shopping facilities in planned shopping centers in the sections of the
jurisdictional area where no clear pattern of business use now exists.  It
is proposed that each such business center be established on a single,
well-planned site of at least six acres in area to accommodate the shopping
needs of a neighborhood.  No specific parcel of property is designated for
this purpose in the zone map, but one shopping center may be established
within l,400 feet of a C3 symbol shown in the zone map.



      (4)   C4.  This district is provided to meet the need for
special business centers to accommodate travelers at important locations
along arterial streets in the jurisdictional area.  Types of business use
are limited in this district.



   (C)   Industrial districts.  Three districts, Il, I2 and IR, are
established to meet the present and future needs of the jurisdictional area
for industrial development.  Residential uses will be excluded from the Il
and I2 Districts.  Where permitted, residential and business uses will
conform to the requirements set forth for them in Appendices A through D
respectively, which follow this chapter, respectively.  The specific
requirements for industrial uses in these Districts are given in Appendices E
and F, which follow this chapter. For special exceptions in the industrial
districts see Appendices G and H, which follow this chapter. A brief
description of the industrial districts follows:



      (1)   I1.  This district incorporates a substantial part of
the existing industrial developments and is provided for industrial
operations utilizing enclosed space for storage, fabricating, and
manufacturing.  It includes the lands in the jurisdictional area which are
best suited to this type of industrial use.



      (2)   I2.  This district provides for general industrial
operations utilizing both enclosed and unenclosed space for storage,
fabricating, and manufacturing.



      (3)   IR.  This district is reserved for planned industrial
parks which are also permitted in this district, while business uses are
excluded.



   (D)   Flood plain district.  The FP District is established to meet
the need for controlling the development of lands which have excessively high
water tables or which are subject to frequent and periodic floods.



(Ord. 2281, passed 4-2-79)



§ 152.18  REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL DISTRICTS.



   (A)   Use.  No building or land shall be used and no building shall
be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, which is arranged,
intended, or designed to be used for any purpose other than a use which is
permitted and specified in a district in which the building or land is
located.



   (B)   Height.  No building shall be erected, constructed, or
structurally altered to exceed in height the limits established and specified
for the use and the district in which the building is located, except as
hereinafter provided in this chapter.



   (C)   Yard, lot area, and size of building.  No building shall be
erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered in any manner which will
encroach upon, or reduce in any manner, the yards, ground floor area of
residential buildings, or lot coverage regulations, established and specified
for the use and the district in which the building is located.  No lot area
shall be so reduced, diminished, and maintained that the yards, other open
space, or total lot area shall be less than specified for the use and
district in which the lot is located.



   (D)   Lots.  Every building hereafter erected shall be located on a
lot.  In no case shall there be more than one principal building used for
residential purposes and its accessory buildings, located on one lot.



   (E)   Parking space, and loading and unloading berths.  Every
building hereafter erected, and every use shall have provided therefor
parking space for motor vehicles and loading and unloading berths as
specified hereinafter.

DISTRICT REGULATIONS



§ 152.25  RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS; MOBILE HOME PARKS.



   (A)   Residential uses defined.  The residential uses defined
below, including accessory buildings and uses, are permitted in the districts
indicated in Appendix A which follows this chapter, when complying with the
requirements listed therein, subject to the provision of this section.



      (1)   "MULTI-FAMILY DWELLING."  A building designed for or
occupied by three or more families, exclusively for dwelling purposes. This
definition includes condominiums and cooperatives.



      (2)   "SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING."  A detached building designed
for or occupied by one family exclusively.



      (3)   "TWO-FAMILY DWELLING."  A detached building designed
for or occupied by two families.  A "DUPLEX DWELLING" has one family unit
above the other and a "DOUBLE DWELLING" has one family unit beside the other.



   (B)   Other provisions for residential uses.



      (1)   Area and width.  A single-family dwelling may be
located on any lot in any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted if the lot was in single ownership or included in a subdivision
which was of record in the office of the County Recorder at the time of
passage of this chapter even though the lot does not have the mininum lot
width or the minimum lot area specified for the district.



      (2)   Rear yard.  One-half of an alley abutting the rear lot
may be included in the required rear yard.




      (3)   Accessory buildings. 




         (a)   Accessory buildings are not permitted prior to the
erection of the principal building. No accessory building shall be located
closer to a side lot line than 3 feet nor exceed 18 feet in height and, if
detached from the principal building, shall be set back from the front line
of the lot no closer than the rear line of the principal building. The only
accessory buildings allowed in residentially zoned districts are private
detached garages and storage sheds. All private garages as that term is
defined herein shall be considered accessory buildings.  A detached private
garage shall not exceed 28 feet in width or 28 feet in length or exceed 784
square feet in area.  A storage shed or "mini-barn", which is a detached
accessory building, but not a private garage, shall not exceed 12 feet in
width or 16 feet in length or exceed 192 square feet in area.  Only one
accessory building shall be allowed per residential lot.



         (b)   In all residentially zoned districts, at no time
shall the surface area occupied by all structures (residence and accessory
buildings) exceed 30% of the residential lot area.  The residential lot area
is the product of the lot width multiplied by the lot length.



      (4)   Accessory uses.  Accessory uses, such as public utility
installations, walks, driveways, curbs, retaining walls, mail boxes, name
plates, lamp posts, bird baths, and structures of a like nature are permitted
in any required front, side, or rear yard.  Trees, shrubs, flowers, or
plants are permitted in any required front, side, or rear yard.



      (5)   Front yard.  Where 25% or more of the lots in the block
are occupied by buildings on the effective date of this chapter, the average
setback of those buildings determines the dimension of the front yard in the
block; however, front yard lines or building setback lines established in a
recorded subdivision shall establish the dimension of front yards in those
subdivisions, except when the building setback lines may be less restrictive
as provided in§  152.03.  A front yard is required on each abutting street
on through lots.



      (6)   Projections into yards.



         (a)   Architectural features (cornice, eave, sill,

inches.  Chimneys may project into any required yard not more than two feet,
provided the width of any required side yard is not reduced to less than
three feet.



         (b)   An open platform or landing which does not extend
above the level of the first floor of the building may extend or project into
any required front or side yard not more than four feet or into any required
rear yard not more than 25% of its depth.



      (7)   Tapered yard.  Where the side lot line of an interior
lot abuts the rear line of a corner lot, or an alley separating such lots, an
accessory building which may be located on the rear lot line of the corner
lot shall be set back from the side street a distance equal to the front yard
line of the abutting interior lot.  For each foot that the accessory
building is placed from the rear line toward the front line of the corner
lot, the building may be set four inches closer to the side street line, but
in no case closer than five feet.



      (8)   Height.  In the districts limiting height to 25 feet, a
multi-family dwelling may be increased in height not to exceed 35 feet,
provided the required side yards are increased an additional two feet for
each foot the structure exceeds 25 feet in height.



      (9)   Swimming pools.  All swimming pools shall comply with
the following requirements:

            2.   Swimming pools located on a lot with a
dwelling unit in the Cl or C2 zoning district shall meet the same
requirements on pool location given for the residential zoning districts
above.



         (c)   Fencing.  All swimming pools shall be enclosed by
a fence which is at least four feet in height.  Rear or side property fences
may be used as the rear or side swimming pool fence.  However, in all
instances, the pool shall be completely contained by a fence on all sides
with a gate having adequate locking mechanism.



      (10)   Fences.



         (a)   Applications for a permit to construct or install
a fence, or hedge over three feet in height which serves the same purposes as
a fence,  shall be submitted to the Building Inspector. Fences, lattice-work
screens, hedges or walls, not more than seven feet in height, may be located
in the required side or rear yard, and a hedge, maintained so as not to
exceed three feet in height, may be located in any front yard.  These fences
or hedges shall be placed a minimum of six inches inside the property line of
the owner's lot.  If a fence or hedge is to be cost-shared with the
adjoining property owner, the fence or hedge may be centered on the property
line. 



         (b)   No residential fence may be constructed of barbed
wire, nor may it be electrified.



         (c)   These restrictions do not apply in regard to
construction or maintenance of a fence of any height in connection with an
agricultural use.



      (11)   In all multi-family developments, 15% of the total lot
area shall be reserved for recreation.

      (1)   General.  Floor area of the mobile home shall not
exceed 40% of the lot size.  The lot area shall not be less than 3,000
square feet and minimum setbacks for each individual lot shall be 12 feet for
side and rear yards and a minimum of 20 feet for the front yard.  No mobile
home shall be closer than 40 feet to the mobile home park sides and rear
property line, and no nearer than 100 feet to the front property line.  All
individual mobile home lots shall include concrete runways of sufficient size
and bearing capacity.  A uniform concrete slab or patio shall be provided

purposes of this chapter to promote health, safety, and the general welfare
of the community.



      (2)   Accessibility.  There shall be at least two principal
entrances from a major thoroughfare which provide appropriate, safe, and
adequate ingress and egress to the mobile home park.  One and one-half
parking spaces shall be provided for each mobile home.  No major
recreational equipment shall be parked or stored on any lot in this district
except in a specific parking area built and designated for such purposes, or
a carport or enclosed building.  However, such equipment may be parked
anywhere on a lot for a period not to exceed 24 hours during loading or
unloading.  No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or house
keeping purposes when parked or stored on a lot, or in any location not
approved for such use.  Automotive vehicles or trailers of any kind or type
without current license plates shall not be parked or stored for more than
seven days on any property other than in completely enclosed buildings with
the exception of licensed antique vehicles.  All mobile homes shall be
placed so that they can be moved and removed individually without moving any
other mobile home.



      (3)   Visibility at intersections.  On a corner lot, nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of 2-1/2 and ten feet above the
centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the
street lines of the corner lots and a line joining points along the street
lines 30 feet from the point of the intersection.



      (4)   Fences, walls, and hedges.  Not withstanding other
provisions of this chapter, fences, walls, and hedges may be permitted in any
required yard or along the edge of any yard, provided that driveway entrances
are not shielded by fences, walls, and hedges in such a way as to obstruct
the view of a driver entering a public road from the driveway.  All mobile
home park districts shall have a screen planting six feet wide by six feet
high around the perimeter of the park itself.



      (5)   Signs.  No sign shall extend beyond any lot line nor
shall any sign hinder or obstruct a pedestrian path or a driver's vision or
passage of the road.  The sign, non-illuminated, up to but not exceeding 16
square feet per side, may be allowed to advertise the mobile home park.  In
any event, prior to installation of any sign, all signs must have approval of
the Plan Commission.



      (6)   Recreation areas.  If the mobile home park is designed
to be occupied by ten mobile homes or more, not less than 15% of the gross
land area of the park shall be improved for recreational activities for the
residents of the park.



      (7)   Common buildings.  Any non-retail structure intended

§ 152.31  WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Title.  These regulations shall officially be known, cited,
and referred to as the “Wireless Telecommunication Facility Regulations of
the City of New Castle, Henry County, Indiana” (hereinafter “these
regulations”).



   (B)   Purposes.  In order to protect the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community, while accommodating the communication needs
of residents and business, these regulations are necessary in order to:



      (1)   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication
services to the residents and businesses of New Castle;



      (2)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through
careful design and siting standards;



      (3)   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas
through performance standards and incentives;



      (4)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower
failure through structural standards and setback requirements; and



      (5)   Provide mechanisms for the mitigation of tower
proliferation through tower-sharing requirements for all new tower applicants
and those existing towers physically capable of sharing.



   (C)   Authority.  The Board of Zoning Appeals (hereinafter “the
Board") is vested with the authority to review, approve, conditionally
approve, and disapprove applications for wireless communication facilities,
including sketch, preliminary and final plans.



   (D)   Jurisdiction.



      (1)   These regulations apply to all wireless communications
facilities located within the incorporated areas of the city.



      (2)   No wireless communications facility may be constructed
without an approved and signed site plan from the city.



   (E)   Enactment.



      (1)   In order that wireless communications facilities may be
constructed in accordance with these purposes and policies, these regulations
are hereby adopted and made effective as of the date of their approval by the
Common Council. 



      (2)   All applications for wireless communication facility
sitings pending on the effective date of these regulations, or thereafter
filed, shall be reviewed under these regulations.



   (F)   Interpretation and conflict.



      (1)   Interpretation. 



         (a)   In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare.



         (b)   These regulations shall be construed broadly to
promote the purposes for which they are adopted.



      (2)   Conflict.



         (a)   These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or
other provision of law except as provided in these regulations.



         (b)   Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute,
or other provision of law, the provision that is more restrictive or imposes
higher standards shall control.



   (G)   Amendments.  For the purpose of protecting the public health,
safety, and general welfare, the Planning Commission may from time to time
propose amendments to these regulations, which shall be approved or
disapproved by the Common Council at a public meeting following public
notice. Realizing that communication technologies are evolving and changing
quickly, future innovations may reduce the impacts of individual facilities
and render portions of these regulations obsolete.  Therefore, periodic
review and revision of these regulations will be necessary.



   (H)   Public purpose.  Regulation of the siting of wireless
communication facilities is an exercise of valid police power delegated by
the State of Indiana, and as stipulated in the Federal Telecommunications Act
of 1996.  The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable
conditions laid down by the Planning Commission.



   (I)   Enforcement, violations, and penalties.



      (1)   The enforcement of these regulations shall be the
responsibility of the Zoning Administrator.



      (2)   Any person who violates these regulations shall be
subject to a fine in an amount of $2,500 per violation.  Each day the
violation exists constitutes a separate violation pursuant to state law.



   (J)   Wireless communication facility application procedure and
approval process.

telecommunication towers erected, constructed, or located within municipality
shall comply with the following requirements.



         (a)   A proposal for a new commercial wireless
telecommunication service tower shall not be approved unless the Board of
Zoning Appeals finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the
proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing approved tower or
building, within a one-mile-search radius (one-half-mile-search radius for
towers under 120 feet in height, one-quarter-mile-search radius for towers
under 60 feet in height) of the proposed tower, due to one or more of the
following reasons.



            1.   The planned equipment would exceed the
structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the
existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.



            2.   The planned equipment would cause
interference materially impacting the usability of the other existing or
planned equipment at the tower or building, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.



            3.   Existing or approved towers and buildings
within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height
necessary to function for reasons documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer.



            4.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it
infeasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an
existing or approved tower or building. 



         (b)   1.   It is the applicant's responsibility to
adequately show due diligence in seeking to colocate telecommunications
facilities.



            2.   The applicant shall submit documented
refusals of attempts to colocate on towers within the search area.

tower is over 100 feet in height; or



               b.   At least one additional user if the
tower is over 60 feet in height.



            2.   Towers shall be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower, and to accept antennas mounted at
varying heights.



      (2)   Tower and antenna design requirements.  Proposed and
modified towers and antennas shall meet the following design requirements.



         (a)   Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend
into the surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging
architectural treatment; except in instances where the color is dictated by
state or federal authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.



         (b)   Commercial wireless telecommunication service
towers shall be of a monopole design, unless the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines that an alternative design would better blend into the surrounding
environment.



      (3)   Tower height.  The maximum tower height permitted in
the city is to be calculated by applying the following standards.



         (a)   If the tower is designed to accommodate only one
service provider, the maximum height shall be 120 feet from grade.



         (b)   If the tower is designed to accommodate two
service providers, the maximum height shall be 160 feet from grade.



         (c)   If the tower is designed to accommodate more than
two service providers, the maximum height shall be 199 feet from grade.



      (4)   Accessory utility buildings.



         (a)   All utility buildings and structures accessory to
a tower shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding
environment, and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district.



         (b)   Ground-mounted equipment shall be completely
screened from view by suitable landscaping and/or vegetation, except where a
design of non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the
architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood.



      (5)   Tower lighting.  Towers shall not be illuminated by
artificial means and display strobe lights, unless such lighting is
specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal
or state authority for a particular tower.



      (6)   Antennas mounted on structures, roofs, walls, and
existing towers.  The placement of wireless telecommunication antennas on
roofs, walls, and existing towers may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator; provided the antennas meet the requirements of these
regulations, after submittal of:



         (a)   A final site and building plan; and



         (b)   A report prepared by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer, indicating the existing structure of the tower's
suitability to accept the antenna, and the proposed method of affixing the
antenna to the structure.  Complete details of all fixtures and couplings,
and the precise point of attachment shall be indicated.



      (7)   Temporary wireless communications facilities.  Any
facility designed for temporary use is subject to the following requirements.

service shall interfere with public safety telecommunications within the city
or county.



         (b)   All applications for new service shall be
accompanied by an intermodulation study, providing a technical evaluation of
existing and proposed transmissions, and indicating all potential
interference problems.



         (c)   Before the introduction of a new service or
changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the
city and county at least ten calendar days in advance of such changes to
allow the city and county to monitor interference levels during the testing
process.



      (9)   Abandoned or unused towers or portions of towers.
Abandoned or unused towers or portions of towers shall be removed in the
following manner.



         (a)   The owner of a wireless facility shall file
annually a declaration with the Zoning Administrator as to continuing
operation of every facility installed subject to these regulations.



         (b)   Failure to do so shall be determined to mean that
the facility is no longer in use and considered abandoned, thus subject to
the following regulations.



         (c)   All abandoned or unused towers and associated
facilities shall be removed within 180 days of the cessation of operations at

   The special exceptions defined below, including accessory buildings and
uses, are permitted in the districts indicated in Appendices G and H
following this chapter, subject to the provisions herein.



   (A)   A "SPECIAL EXCEPTION" is one contemplated by this chapter,
which is likely or liable but not certain to occur, and is compatible with
the essential design of a particular zone, although the use is contrary to
the restrictions imposed thereon.  A "SPECIAL EXCEPTION" is not at variance
with the various elements or objectives of this chapter and the comprehensive
plan; therefore, a "SPECIAL EXCEPTION" shall not be construed to be a zone
change and shall be granted by the Plan Commission in those cases in which
such an exception is suitable and appropriate.



   (B)   The maximum building height for special exceptions shall be as
provided in Appendix H following this chapter.



   (C)   Whenever a special exception is expanded or enlarged, parking
space shall be provided for the expanded or enlarged portion thereof in
accordance with the requirements of this section.



   (D)   Other provisions and requirements for special exceptions are
as follows:



      (1)   The maximum building height requirement in Appendix H
may be increased if buildings are set back, from front and rear property
lines, one foot for each two feet of additional height above the maximum
building height requirement.



      (2)   In all districts, spires, church steeples, chimneys,
cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, fire towers, scenery lofts, and essential
mechanical appurtenances may be erected to any height not prohibited by other
laws or ordinances.

§ 152.36  VARIANCES.



   (A)   Upon receipt of an application for an improvement location
permit for a variance by the Building Commissioner, it shall be referred to
the Plan Commission for investigation as to the manner in which the proposed
location and character of the variance will affect the master plan.  The
Commission shall report the results of its study to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within 45 days following receipt of the application.  If no such
report has been filed with the Board within this time period, the Board may
proceed to process the application.



   (B)   The Board shall then proceed with a hearing on the application
in the manner prescribed in § 152.48.  Following the hearing, and upon an
affirmative finding by the Board that the conditions listed below exist, the
Board shall order the Building Commissioner to issue an improvement location
permit for the variance.



      (1)   The variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this chapter; will not substantially and permanently injure the
appropriate use of neighboring property; and will serve the public
convenience and welfare; and



      (2)   If the property owner complies with the provisions of
this chapter:



         (a)   He can secure no reasonable return from, or make
no reasonable use of, his property;



         (b)   Hardship results from the application of this
chapter to his property;



         (c)   The hardship of which he complains is suffered by
his property directly, and not merely by others;



         (d)   The hardship is not the result of his own actions;
and



         (e)   The hardship is peculiar to the property of the
applicant.



   (C)   An existing use which is listed herein as a variance, and
which is located in a district in which such variance may be permitted, is a
conforming use.  Any expansion of such variance involving the enlargement of
the buildings, structures, and land area devoted to that use shall be
considered a variance and subject to the procedure described in this section.

passage of this chapter, may be continued although such use does not conform
to all the provisions of this chapter, except as hereinafter provided.



   (A)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout a building
provided no structural alterations are made therein, except those required by
law.



   (B)   A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or greater restrictions, provided no structural changes are
made in the building.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a
conforming use or to a use permitted in a district of greater restrictions,
it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use of a less
restricted one.



   (C)   No building shall be erected upon any premises devoted to a
nonconforming use, except in conformance with regulations of this chapter.



   (D)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize, by written permit,
in a residentially zoned district for a period of not more than one year from
the date of the permit, a temporary building for commercial or industrial use
incidental to the residential construction and development of said district.



   (E)   Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of a building for which a building
permit has been heretofore issued, and the construction of which has been
diligently prosecuted within 90 days of the date of the permit, and which
entire building shall be completed according to such plans filed within three
years from the date of passage of this chapter.



   (F)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or
premises is discontinued for a period of one year, the use thereof shall
thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it is
located.



   (G)   Any nonconforming open use of land shall be discontinued
within five years from the date of passage of this chapter.



   (H)   When a building containing a nonconforming use is damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy to the extent of 50% of its
current market value, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the
regulations of the district within which it is located.



   (I)   These provisions apply in the same manner to a use which may
become a nonconforming use due to a later amendment to this chapter.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



§ 152.45  ADMINISTRATION BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER.



   The Building Commissioner is hereby designated and authorized to
enforce this chapter.



(Ord. 2281, passed 4-2-79)



§ 152.46  IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMITS.



   (A)   Any person who shall make application for an improvement
location permit shall furnish the Building Commissioner with a site plan or
development plan of the real estate upon which the application for an
improvement location permit is made.  The site plan or development plan
shall be drawn to scale showing the following items:



      (1)   Legal or site description of the real estate involved.



      (2)   Location and size of all buildings and structures.



      (3)   Width and length of all entrances and exits to and from
the real estate.



      (4)   All adjacent and adjoining roads or highways.



   (B)   Site plans so furnished to the Building Commissioner shall be
filed by the Building Commissioner and shall become a permanent record.



   (C)   The Building Commissioner may require the relocation of any
proposed building, structure, exit, or entrance shown on the site plan or the
location of new exits or entrances not shown on the site plan before issuing
an improvement location permit when such action is necessary to carry out the
purpose and intent of this chapter.



   (D)   An application for an improvement location permit for any use
subject to the provisions of § 152.20 shall be accompanied by a certificate
of compliance subscribed by a registered professional engineer of the state,
certifying that the use intended will satisfy the performance standards of
the district in which it is to be located.  The Building Commissioner may
take ten days in which to study the application, during which time he may
consult with appropriate technical consultants.  If, after the ten-day
period, the Building Commissioner has not required any additional information
or stated any objections in writing, the Building Commissioner shall issue
the improvement location permit.



   (E)   The Building Commissioner shall issue an improvement location
permit for a variance only following receipt of notice from the Board of
Zoning Appeals that the application therefor has been approved by the Board.



   (F)   Any person, to whom is issued an improvement location permit
for a shopping center pursuant to division (E), above, who fails to commence
construction within 24 months after the permit is issued, or who fails to
carry to completion 30% of the total development plan thereof within three
years after the permit is issued, or within one year after construction is
begun, whichever is later, or who fails to conform to the provisions of the
development plan and supporting data finally approved by the Board and upon
the basis of which such improvement location permit was issued, may be
required by the Board upon its own motion, and shall be required by the Board
upon written petition of any person deeming himself aggrieved, to show cause
why the approval should not be withdrawn and the permit revoked.  However,
no such order to show cause shall be issued for failure to commence
construction within 24 months after the construction has in fact commenced,
even though commenced after the expiration of the 24-month period.



      (1)   Upon the determination by the Board or petition by such
person to require the holder of the permit to show cause pursuant to the
provisions of this division, the Board shall set the same for public hearing,
and cause written notice thereof to be sent by registered mail to the permit
holder, and to be published according to law.  The notice shall name a day
not less than ten days after the date the notice is mailed and after the
publication of notice of the date when such hearing will be held.



      (2)   If after the hearing, upon evidence publicly presented
to the Board by members of the public or officers or employees of the city,
including members of the Board, present in person at the hearing, the Board
shall find that the holder of the permit in question has failed to commence
construction of the shopping center within 24 months from the date the
improvement location permit was issued, has failed to carry to completion 30%
of the total development plan within three years after that date, or has
failed materially to conform to the provisions of the development plan and
supporting data finally approved by the Board and upon the basis of which
such improvement location permit was issued, the Board shall withdraw its
approval of the development plan and order the permit revoked.



      (3)   However, the Board may, if it deems the failure
correctable within a period of six months, extend the time within which the
permit holder may purge himself of the failure for not longer than that
period, during which period the hearing shall be continued to a day certain
at the end thereof.



   (G)   Not more than one improvement location permit for each C3
District symbol on the zone map may be issued and outstanding at any one time.



   (H)   In the event the Board shall revoke an improvement location
permit under the authority of division (F) hereof, it may thereafter grant
approval for another shopping center development in the same C3 District
subject to all of the provisions and requirements of this chapter.



   (I)   The holder of an improvement location permit for a shopping
center may apply to the Board at any time for an alteration, change,
amendment, or extension of the development plan upon which such permit is
based.



      (1)   Upon receipt of the application the Board shall proceed
as in the case of original applications for an improvement location permit
for a variance.



      (2)   In the event the Board shall approve and order the
development plan changed, altered, amended, or extended, it shall so notify
the Building Commissioner, who shall issue an amended improvement location
permit accordingly.

§ 152.47  CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.



   (A)   No land shall be occupied or used and no building hereafter
erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered shall be occupied or used, in
whole or in part, for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate of
occupancy shall have been issued by the Building Commissioner stating that
the building and use comply with all of the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the building or premises or the use in the district in which it
is to be located.



   (B)   Upon completion of the improvement covered by the improvement
location permit, the Building Commissioner shall inspect the premises, and,
if his inspection shall reveal that the improvement has been completed in
substantial conformity with the site plan, and certificate of compliance,
when required, submitted pursuant to § 152.46(A) and (D), and any approved
amendments thereto, he shall issue a certificate of occupancy.



   (C)   No change shall be made in the use of land (except
agricultural) or in the use of any building or part thereof, now or hereafter
erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, without a certificate of
occupancy having been issued by the Building Commissioner.  No such permit
shall be issued to make such a change unless it is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.



   (D)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for coincidentally
with the application for an improvement location permit and shall be issued
within ten days after the lawful erection, reconstruction, or structural
alteration of the building or other improvement of the land shall have been
completed.



   (E)   A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on
file in the office of the Building Commissioner, and copies shall be
furnished upon request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest
in the building or land affected.



   (F)   No improvement location permit shall be issued for excavation
for or the erection, reconstruction, or structural alteration, of any
building, before application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.

chapter.



      (3)   Authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance
from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where owing to special conditions, fully demonstrated on the basis
of the facts presented, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done.



   (F)   In exercising its powers, the Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or

   (G)   Every decision of the Board shall be subject to review by
certiorari.



   (H)   No variance in the application of the provisions of this

circumstances or conditions applicable to the property or to the intended use
that do not apply generally to the other property or class of use in the same
vicinity and district.



      (2)   That the variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the
same vicinity and district but which is denied to the property in question.



      (3)   That the granting of the variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or
improvements in the vicinity and district in which the property is located.



      (4)   That the granting of the variance will not alter the
land use characteristics of the vicinity and district, diminish the
marketable value of adjacent land and improvements, or increase the
congestion in the public streets.



      (5)   That the granting of such variance complies with the
requirements of § 152.36(B).

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES



§ 153.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore,
the City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage;



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands; and



   (F)   Make federal flood insurance available for structures and
their contents in the City by fulfilling the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains; and



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
flood blight areas.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



DEFINITIONS



§ 153.10  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   “A ZONE.”  Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In “A
ZONES”, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below:



      (1)   “ZONE A.”  Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been
performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.



      (2)   “ZONE AE AND A1-A30.”  Areas subject to inundation
by the 1% annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base
flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised
maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)



      (3)   “ZONE AO.”  Areas subject to inundation by 1%
annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where
average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived
from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.



      (4)   “ZONE AH.”  Areas subject to inundation by 1%
annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average
depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.



      (5)   “ZONE AR.”  Areas that result from the
decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is
determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood
protection.



      (6)   “ZONE A99.”  Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon
completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These
are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the
construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. “ZONE A99" may only be
used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory
progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.



   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).”  A structure with a
floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the
use of the principal structure. “ACCESSORY STRUCTURES” should constitute
a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be
designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.



   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).”  Any walled and roofed
expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected
by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   “APPEAL.”  A request for a review of the Floodplain
Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter.



   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.”  A designated AO or AH Zone on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   “BASE FLOOD.”  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.



   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).”  The elevation of the 1% annual
chance flood.



   “BASEMENT.”  That portion of a structure having its floor
sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.



   “BOUNDARY RIVER.”  The part of the Ohio River that forms the
boundary between Kentucky and Indiana.



   “BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY.”  The floodway of a boundary river.



   “BUILDING.”  See “STRUCTURE.”



   “COMMUNITY.”  A political entity that has the authority to adopt
and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).”  A program developed by the
Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities
in the Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain
management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from
flooding.



   “CRITICAL FACILITY.”  A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   “D ZONE.”  Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined,
but flooding is possible. Flood insurance is available in participating

Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.



   (D)   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any
more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be
utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing
all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.

existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.20  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
ELEVATIONS.



   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site
shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not
be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.21  INTERPRETATION.

   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.22  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

153.32(B)(6) for additional information.)



   (B)   Construction stage.



      (1)   Upon establishment of the lowest floor of an elevated
structure or structure constructed on fill, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the
NAVD 88 or NGVD elevation of the lowest floor, as built. Said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey data submitted.
The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such review before any
further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure
to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work
order for the project. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the
elevation certification shall be at the applicant’s risk.



      (2)   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of a
floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered professional
engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator shall review
the floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall correct any
deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is allowed to
proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.



   (C)   Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, an
elevation certification which depicts the “as-built” lowest floor
elevation is required to be submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. If the
project includes a floodproofing measure, floodproofing certification is
required to be submitted by the applicant to the Floodplain Administrator.

(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.44 STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.



   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 153.16, are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
has erosion, potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction
of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/
improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river
floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/
improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining
a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition
above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources).



   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of
authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development
Permit, provided the provisions contained in §§ 153.40 through 153.47 have
been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than
the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if
any) shall take precedence.



   (C)   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.



   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the City shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per
mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)  Penalty, see § 153.99



§ 153.45  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.



   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the
provisions contained in this subchapter have been met. The key provision is
that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved
structure shall be at or above the FPG.



(Ord. 3715, passed 2-17-15)



§ 153.46  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
AND/OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.



   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 1%
annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has
been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.



      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the
proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided
the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive
than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
and the provisions contained in §§ 153.40 through 153.47 have been met.



   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square
mile.



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual
chance flood elevation for the site.



      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§ 153.40 through 153.47 have been met.



   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

city that qualities relating to its history and harmonious outward appearance
of its structures be preserved. This purpose is advanced through the
restoration and preservation of historic areas and buildings, the
construction of compatible new buildings where appropriate, and the
maintenance and insurance of compatibility in regards to style, form,
proportion, texture, and material between historic buildings and those of
contemporary design. It is the intention of the city through this chapter to
preserve and protect historic and architecturally worthy buildings,
structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, and neighborhoods which impart a
distinct aesthetic quality to the city and serve as visible reminders of its
historic heritage.

(Ord. 3431, passed 6-6-05)



§ 155.04  HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND GUIDELINES.



   (A)   All recommendations for the establishment of a historic
district shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on the
criteria outlined in this section. A recommendation for establishing a
historic district may be initiated from either of the following two sources:



      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit
historic district maps for City Council approval.



      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a
historic district which includes their property may petition the Commission
to consider drawing and submitting a map or maps of said property to the City
Council for its approval. The Commission may establish in its rules criteria
to be met before it considers a petition.



   (B)   Conservation districts. The Commission may recommend and the
City Council may provide that the establishment of a historic district shall
occur in two phases. During the first phase, which continues for a period of
three years from the date the ordinance is adopted, a certificate of
appropriateness is required for the following activities: the demolition of
any building; the moving of any building; and any new construction of a
principal building or accessory building or structure subject to view from a
public way.



      (1)   At the expiration of the initial three-year period, the
first phase of a conservation district continues and the second phase does
not become effective if a majority of the property owners in the district
object to the Commission,  in writing, to the requirement that certificates
of appropriateness be issued for the following activities:



         (a)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of
historic buildings by additions, construction, alteration, or maintenance
involving exterior color changes;



         (b)   A change in walls and fences or construction of
walls and fences, if along public ways;

non-historic buildings subject to view from a public way by additions,
reconstruction, alteration, or maintenance involving exterior color change.



      (2)   The objections of a majority of the property owners must
be received by the Commission not earlier than 180 days or later than 60 days
before the third anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance.



   (C)   Commission preparation of historic district maps. In order to
establish a historic district, the Commission shall first prepare a map
describing the district in accordance with the following:



      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the
Commission which identifies historic buildings, structures and sites located
within the city.



      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a
property containing a single building, structure, or site.



      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and
secondary areas as follows:



         (a)   Primary area. The principal area of historic and
architectural significance.



         (b)   Secondary area. An area adjacent to a primary area
which has a visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the
preservation of the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area
is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.



   (D)   (1)   The Commission shall classify and designate on the
map all buildings, structures, and sites within each historic district
described on the map. Buildings, structures, and sites shall be classified as
historic or non-historic. Historic buildings, structures, and sites must
possess identified historic or architectural merit of a degree warranting
their preservation. The Commission shall further classify and designate all
buildings and structures within a proposed historic district as follows:



         (a)   Outstanding;



         (b)   Notable; or



         (c)   Contributing.



      (2)   Non-historic buildings, structures, and sites are those
not classified on the map as historic. In lieu of other classifications, the
Commission may devise its own system of further classification of historic
buildings, structures, and sites.



   (E)   City Council approval of maps of historic districts. Before a
historic district is established and the building classifications take
effect, the map setting forth the district's boundaries and building
classifications must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the
City Council.



   (F)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing
boundaries of a historic district may be recorded in the Office of the Henry
County Recorder.

   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building,
structure, or site to be under interim protection under this section, the
Commission shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner
or occupant of the building, structure or site with a written notice of the
declaration. The written notice must:



      (1)   Cite the authority of the Commission to put the

      (2)   Approved in an ordinance or rejected by the City Council.



   (D)   While a building, structure, or site is under interim
protection under this section:



      (1)   The building, structure, or site may not be demolished
or moved; and,

         (a)   Addition;



         (b)   Reconstruction; or



         (c)   Alteration.



   (E)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at
any time during the period of interim protection, provided the proposed
change meets the criteria for considering effect of actions on historic
buildings in § 155.06(D) and any proposed preservation guidelines prepared
for the building, structure, or site, but the certificate of appropriateness
shall have no effect, and no action may be taken pursuant thereto, unless the
map including the building, structure or site is approved by the City Council.

so that surface water and groundwater are protected, soil erosion is
controlled, and flooding potential is not increased;



      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to
construct, repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems;



      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells;



      (7)   Assure that stormwater controls are incorporated into
site planning and design at the earliest possible stage;



      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of
soil, especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands;



      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to
roads, embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and
stormwater management practices that are the result of inadequate soil
erosion, sediment and stormwater control;



      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects
needed to address problems caused by inadequate stormwater, erosion and
sediment control;



      (11)   Require the construction of stormwater management
practices that serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion
and sediment control, and require water quality protection; and encourage
such practices that promote recreation and habitat preservation; and



      (12)   Ensure that all stormwater management, soil erosion and
sediment control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

permittee to both the city and the post-construction operator of the BMP
(including Homeowners’ Associations) upon completion of construction
activities and prior to the city giving final approval for the completed
construction.



   (B)   Single-family and multi-family residential developments. A
Homeowners' Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected
lands and shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance
and inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections
become officially accepted by the city. The Association shall be initially
established with adequate funding mechanisms in place to provide the required
maintenance.



   (C)   Apartments. Commercial and industrial developments. The plans
will clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously
responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity
unless the city officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.



   (D)   Maintenance design. All temporary and permanent soil erosion
and sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site
structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected
and maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the
plans. Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically
throughout the year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.



   (E)   Perpetual maintenance inspections. One inspection with a
written report will be performed each year. The written report will be
submitted to the MS4 Operator by May 1 of each and every year after the Best
Management Practice (BMP) has been completed.



   (F)   Structures that require a permit from the Indiana IDNR. A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources (IDNR). This applies to all BMPs that require a permit either at
the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the IDNR at any
time after construction is completed.



   (G)   Easements. A written report from an inspector on the status of
all stormwater management easements for each project shall be submitted to
the MS4 Operator by May 1 of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement
and will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.



   (H)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk
for loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure
related to imminent failure as determined by the MS4 Operator. A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer or landscape architect on the
status of permanent soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management
systems and the status of the related easements shall be submitted to the MS4
Operator by May 1 of each year into perpetuity.



   (I)   BMPs that have a potential loss of life. A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of
life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be
prepared by a professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid
state license that authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for
construction.



(Ord. 3436, passed 9-6-05)



§ 156.16  MINIMUM STANDARDS.



   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning
and practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the
following standards:



   (A)   (1)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow
of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring;



      (2)   All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional;



      (3)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more
phases. The first phase will include only those locations necessary to
install the perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs.
After the perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining
phase(s) of clearing and grubbing may continue; and



      (4)   Structural practices shall be used to control erosion
and trap sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.



   (B)   Sediment barriers.



      (1)   Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control,
silt fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the
maximum drainage areas to silt fence for a particular slope is shown in the
table below.



Table 1: Sill Fence Applicability



 


Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 linear feet of silt fence

 
Range of slope for a particular drainage area (in percent)


0.5
 
< 2%


0.25
 
> 2% but < 20%


0.125
 
> 20% but < 50%



 



      (2)   This does not preclude the use of other sediment
barriers designed to control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated
by a sediment barrier shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment
barrier. Straw bale barriers are not acceptable.



   (C)   Stormwater diversion practices. Stormwater diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains and diversions, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to ten
acres. Stormwater diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment
settling pond.



   (D)   Timing of sediment trapping practices. Sediment control
practices shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth
disturbing activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other
practices intended to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and
within seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function
until the up slope development area is permanently restabilized. As
construction progresses and the topography is altered, appropriate controls
must be constructed or existing controls altered to address the changing
drainage patterns.



   (E)   Stabilization of denuded areas.



      (1)   Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in the
tables below:



   Table 2: Permanent Stabilization



 


Area requiring permanent stabilization

 
Time frame to apply erosion controls


Any areas that will lie dormant for one year or more
 
Within seven days of the most recent disturbance


Any areas within 50 feet of a stream and at final grade
 
Within two days of reaching final grade


Any other areas at final grade
 
Within seven days of reaching final grade within that area



 



   Table 3: Temporary Stabilization



 


Area requiring temporary stabilization

 
Time frame to apply erosion controls


Any disturbed areas within 50 feet of a stream and not at final grade
 
Within two days of the most recent disturbance if the area will remain idle
for more than 21 days


For all construction activities, any disturbed areas that will be dormant for
more than 21 days but less than one year, and not within 50 feet of a stream
 
- Within seven days of the most recent disturbance within the area

- For residential subdivisions, disturbed areas must be stabilized at least
seven days prior to transfer of NPDES permit coverage

- For the individual lot(s). Proof of permit coverage transfer must be
submitted to the city. The city shall then inspect the lot to ensure that the
temporary seeding has been done.


Disturbed areas that will be idle over winter
 
Prior to the onset of winter weather



 



      (2)   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause
structural instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative
stabilization techniques must be employed.



   (F)   Sediment settling ponds. Stormwater runoff that exceeds the
design capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated stormwater flows shall
pass through a sediment settling facility.



      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten or more
acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling
pond must be provided and maintained until final stabilization of the site.
In single-family residential construction, final stabilization is after the
houses are built and permanent landscaping is done.



         (a)   Alternative equivalent controls may be used if
approved by the appropriate city officials.



         (b)   It is recommended that for drainage locations of
less than ten acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps
be used.



      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than
67 cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the
primary (principal) spillway.



      (3)   Permanent stormwater management ponds that are designed
to trap sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow
release of sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 72
hours, or meet the criteria in the Indiana Storm Water Quality Manual
whichever is most stringent. If the ponds are designed to provide final
runoff control, pre-development and post-development runoff calculations
certified by a professional engineer registered in Indiana shall be provided
with discharge rate requirements established by the city. The pond shall also
be cleaned of construction debris and sediment following permanent erosion
control establishment.



      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet
of settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit
of width (> 2:1 length to width ratio).



      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less
than or equal to five feet.



      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling
ponds when the design capacity has been reduced by 40%.



      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children,
must be considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design.



      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be
constructed in any stream channel. Permanent settling or retention/detention
ponds will only be allowed in streams if permitted and approved by IDEM, IDNR
and any other regulatory agency with review authority.



   (G)   Storm sewer inlet protection.



      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not
enter the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a sediment
settling pond and is exempted in writing by the city. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer
protection shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final
stabilization, as determined by the city.



      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall
hydraulically clean the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the city. All
sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed
downstream.



   (H)   Storm sewer and other drainage outlets. Where practical, all
storm sewers, footer drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be
outlet at the bottom of the slope. Structural measures will be taken so that
the slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being drained
through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the stream
or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is outletted
on.



   (I)   Working near, or crossing streams and wetlands.



      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources,
wetlands, riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must
cross these areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall
be constructed. Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed
and banks, shall be restabilized immediately after in-channel work is
completed, interrupted, or stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in
making stream crossings.



      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be
dumped or placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may
slough, slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing
is authorized by the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army
Corps of Engineers and IDEM, for such purposes as, but not limited to,
constructing bridges, culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.



      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to
streams, structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to
protect the adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.



      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be
constructed in a stream channel.



      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the city will
be implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the
ordinary high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its
natural state as a permanent buffer.



   (J)   Construction entrance.



      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto
public roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.



      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be
implemented as required by the city. These will be planned and installed
according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Indiana
Stormwater Quality Manual.



      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface,
the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more
frequently, in order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from
paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only
after shoveling or sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer
inlet protection is properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds
exist and are properly functioning.



      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to
enable equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone)
can be used.



   (K)   Unstable soils.



      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county
soil survey or by a detailed soil report.



      (2)   The city may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.



      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall
not be graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the
work is performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.



   (L)   Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage.
Consideration shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil
type, up slope drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization.
The minimum final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical
ratio of 2:1 (the horizontal will be two times the vertical).



   (M)   Stabilization of outfalls and channels. Outfalls and
constructed or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to
withstand the expected velocity of flow from the planned post-development
frequency storm without eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and
flow shall include the entire contributing watershed.



   (N)   Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetative
cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently
stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until
ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the city, has 80%
vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate
cover, and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and
survive adverse weather conditions.



   (O)   Disposition of temporary practices. All temporary soil erosion
and sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final
site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the city. Trapped sediment shall be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The construction
maintenance guarantee shall not be released by the city until all temporary
soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed have
been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.



   (P)   Underground utility construction. The construction of
underground utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following
criteria:



      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days;



      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters
resulting from dewatering activities. If trench or groundwater contains
sediment, it must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally
effective sediment control device, prior to being discharged from the
construction site or to waters of the state; and



      (3)   When discharging clean groundwater care must be taken to
ensure that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed
soils or other pollutant sources.



   (Q)   Inspections.



      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control
has been used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be
replaced or modified for the site conditions.



      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site
inspected for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns
every seven calendar days, and within 24 hours of one-half inch or greater
rainfall event until the MS4 Operator or appointed representative certifies
the site as being stable and all permanent facilities are established.



      (3)   The owner, or his or her designated representative,
shall keep a written log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements
to the soil erosion, sediment control or other environmental controls. The
inspections shall include the date of the inspection, the name of the
inspector, weather conditions, and the actions needed to correct the
identified problems.



      (4)   The inspection log will include the date and actions
taken to correct problems noted in past inspection logs.



      (5)   A copy of all of the required inspection logs will be
submitted to the MS4 Operator within three working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.



      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials
that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the
potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.



      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the
comprehensive stormwater management plan shall be observed to ensure that
they are operating correctly.



      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain
whether erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing
significant impacts to the receiving waters.



      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.



      (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in
need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds,
it must be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection.
Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the
inspection.



      (11)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails
to perform its intended function and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the comprehensive stormwater management plan must be
amended by the owner and the new control practice must be installed within
ten days of the inspection.



      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has
not been implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be
installed within ten days from the date of inspection.



      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control
practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as
to why the control practice is not needed.



   (R)   Control of materials and debris. Site management practices
shall be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or
other debris from entering the city's and state's water resources or
wetlands. These practices shall include, but are not limited to, the
following:



      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster,
drywall, grout, gypsum and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided
for the proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.



      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street,
catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A
designated area for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for
all concrete washouts.



      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked
storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a
minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the
storage area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be
followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be
kept in the "dike" tank at all times.



      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils
must be disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and
statutes. IDEM can provide guidance on these issues.



      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial landuse or a site that
is contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other
IDEM or RCRA regulated contaminates, the stormwater is considered wastewater.
Discharge of pollutants to the city sewer system must be approved by city
wastewater personnel. The city may elect to refuse such contaminated
discharge.



      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development
projects on solid waste landfill sites.



      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other
paint wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in
accordance with applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these
wastes shall occur at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes
into surface or groundwaters.



         (a)   Water based paint washing liquids and small
quantities of excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a
connected sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal
system.



         (b)   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint
cleaning materials will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal
dumpster.



      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at
all times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the
construction.



      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or
local agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or
commercial use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a
regulated pollutant.



   (S)   Pre-winter stabilization. If the development area will, or is
planned to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the
development area shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting. The meeting
will be held before October 1. The owner shall invite the operator,
developer, engineer, contractor, MS4 Operator and anyone else requested by
the city to the meeting.



   (T)   Stormwater basins.



      (1)   Pool geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the
pond is 3:1 (the length will be three times the width).



      (2)   Riser in embankment. The riser shall be located within
the embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will
be by manholes.



      (3)   Water drains. Each retention basin shall have a
drainpipe that can completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow,
stone filtration barrier or other mechanism within the pond to prevent
sediment deposition from plugging the drain.



      (4)   Adjustable valves. Both the stormwater management and
water quality basin drains shall have adjustable valves. Valves shall be
located inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism,
the handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.



      (5)   Principal spillway. Each principal spillway shall have
the capacity to pass the 100-year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size
for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the structure
goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into orifice
control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall be no
less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Pressure joint pipe is
required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.



      (6)   Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be
provided on each stormwater management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment. Emergency spillways shall have
a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in writing by the city.



      (7)   Embankments. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.



      (8)   Safety features.



         (a)   The primary spillway opening shall not permit
access to the public and other non-maintenance personnel.



         (b)   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are
deeper than three feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:



            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%,
which extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a
minimum of 25 feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and
maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench
may be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the
water pool.



            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the
aquatic bench shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every
one foot vertical).



            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the
shoreline far enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15
inches below the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be
landscaped to prevent access to the deeper water pool.



            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and
below the permanent water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (two feet
horizontal for every one foot vertical).



            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and
managed to eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.



            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not
exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.



            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices
used to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications
in the current edition of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.



         (c)   Alternative safety features including fencing and
other access restrictions may also be considered as acceptable by the city.



   (U)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the
right of the city to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the city to waive,
in writing, individual requirements.



   (V)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current
edition of the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.



   (W)   Methods for controlling increases in stormwater runoff peaks
and volumes may include, but are not limited to:



      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for
example, grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where
practical, discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined
drainage channels;



      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a
level of control in flow paths and stream gradients;



      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased stormwater runoff into
soil, where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas
where soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities;
and



      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example,
permanent retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface
detention tanks.

   (A)   Runoff rate. The peak runoff rate from the development area
shall not be greater after development than it was before development. The
applicant shall provide engineer certified calculations proving no increase
in the runoff rates from the two, ten, 25, and 100-year storms. Peak runoff
rates for the post-developed 100-year storm event shall be limited to the
pre-developed ten-year peak rate. Where appropriate in the city's opinion,
design shall also limit peak runoff rates for the post-developed ten-year
storm to the pre-developed two-year storm peak discharge rate. All stormwater
calculations shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the
State of Indiana. Complete calculations and logic for all portions of the
runoff calculations shall be submitted in a clear and orderly format.



   (B)   Runoff volume. When determined by the city due to downstream
stormwater facility limitations, increases in the runoff volume shall be
offset by further restricting runoff rates. Increased stormwater discharge to
combination sewers, if approved by the city, shall be offset by a factor of
2:1 by developer funded combined sewer system (CSS) mitigation projects
downstream of or immediately upstream of the development.



   (C)   Where the city determines that site constraints exist in a
manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management
of stormwater runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives
may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction
of stormwater runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent
and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet
the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives
shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development
project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:



      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the city.
These fees shall be applied by the city to stormwater management practices
that reduce existing stormwater runoff in the drainage basin impacted by the
owner;



      (2)   Implementation of off-site stormwater management
practices;



      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration;



      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing stormwater management
practice; or



      (5)   Other practices approved by the city in keeping with the
intent of this section.

(Ord. 3436, passed 9-6-05)  Penalty, see § 156.99



§ 156.20  CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.



   (A)   All permanent stormwater, soil erosion, other wastes control,
and water quality practices not specifically waived by the city shall be
constructed prior to the granting of the final plat approval.



   (B)   Upon the request of the owner, the city may defer the
construction or installation of a permanent stormwater, soil erosion,
sediment, or other wastes control or water quality practice prior to the
approval of the final plat where, in the city's judgment, such proper
construction or installation is not immediately necessary for the protection
of the public health and safety; and where the prior installation or
construction of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the
owner because in the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because
in the case of concrete, building construction could cause cracking and
excessive wear and tear on new structures. In such event, the city may elect
to require a security bond, escrow account, certified check or cash to
guarantee that such deferred improvements will be properly constructed or
installed within an agreed specified time, but not to exceed six months after
the filing of such final plat. In no case shall land disturbing activities
begin prior to the installation of the required stormwater and erosion
control facilities being in place.



   (C)   The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all
permanent improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality
practices.



   (D)   The city may require a security bond, escrow account,
certified check or cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent
soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes controls and water quality practices
will be constructed, maintained and removed in a timely manner, as determined
by the city. The city will utilize owner/developer submittal information in
part to determine the need for bonds, escrow account deposit or other
acceptable guarantees for each specific project. Potential impacts to the
environment, receiving streams, adjacent property owners, right-of-ways as
well as drainage basin area, erosion improvement complexity and cost will be
considered in determining any guarantee requirements. The following divisions
detail such guarantee requirements that may be required for a specific
project.



      (1)   The guarantee. The guarantee of both performance and
maintenance will be in the form of a security bond, escrow account, certified
check or cash. The security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash will
be used by the city to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of
improvements or temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or
removed by the owner in a timely manner, as determined by the city. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash will be in the total
amount of both the performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee.
Indiana municipalities and counties may require performance bonds or other
guarantees for water management improvement.



         (a)   Security bond, escrow account, verified check or
cash shall be deposited with the city prior to review by the city and/or its
consultants to cover professional services of the MS4 Operator, Building
Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the city.



         (b)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted
until a security bond, escrow account, certified check or cash has been
posted to the satisfaction of the city sufficient for the city to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible for
the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the city and all permit and inspection fees required by these
regulations have been paid in full.



         (c)   No project subject to this regulation shall
commence without the comprehensive stormwater management plan having been
approved by the city.



      (2)   Performance guarantee. The furnishing of a performance
guarantee will be maintained in an amount of not less than 120% of the
estimate approved by the city, of installation of the deferred improvements.



      (3)   Maintenance guarantee. The maintenance guarantee shall
be maintained for a period of not less than two years after final acceptance
of the installed stormwater, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices in an amount equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the city, of
the construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.



      (4)   Time extension. The city may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.



      (5)   Completion. Upon completion of the construction of
improvements or temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion,
sediment, and other wastes control practices for which the performance
guarantee has been provided the owner shall notify the city of this fact.



      (6)   Inspection. The city will not release the security bond,
escrow account, certified check or cash guarantee until the city or appointed
representative has inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s)
have been completed and/or removed.



      (7)   Slow release devices. Performance and maintenance
guarantees will be maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release
devices installed in detention and retention basins until the entire site has
reached final soil stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family
residential developments is when 90% of the homes are constructed with their
lawns completely installed and any remaining unbuilt lots having been
permanently stabilized with a uniform ground cover at a growth density of 80%
or better.



      (8)   Release. The construction maintenance guarantee shall
not be released by the city until all temporary soil erosion and sediment
control practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly
disposed of and any trapped sediment has been stabilized.



(Ord. 3436, passed 9-6-05)



§ 156.21  INSPECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENTS.



   The city or its designated representative may inspect any project site
involved in construction activities regulated by this rule at reasonable
times. The city or its designated representatives may make recommendations to
the project site owner or their representative to install appropriate
measures beyond those specified in the comprehensive stormwater management
plan.



(Ord. 3436, passed 9-6-05)



§ 156.99  PENALTIES.



   (A)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined
no more than $1,000 or imprisoned for no more than 180 days, or both, for
each offense.



   (B)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during
or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.



   (C)   Fines or penalties imposed upon the city or the specific
development by other local, state or federal agencies over and above the city
fines shall be the responsibility of the property owner and developer.



   (D)   Upon notice from the city, or designated representative, that
work is being performed contrary to this regulation, such work shall
immediately stop. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner or person responsible for the development area, or person performing
the work, and shall state the conditions under which such work may be
resumed; provided, however, in instances where immediate action is deemed
necessary for public safety or the public interest, the city may require that
work be stopped upon verbal order pending issuance of the written order.



   (E)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall
not preclude the city, by or through its City Attorney and/or any of their
assistants, from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a court
of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain,
correct or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of
this regulation or other applicable laws, or ordinances, rules or regulations
or the orders of the city.
