703.2. Administrative Appeals
To hear and decide where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer or the Planning Board.
703.3. (Intentionally Blank)
703.4. Variance
To grant a variance from the requirements of this Ordinance. To hear and decide, upon appeal, in specific cases, such variances from the requirements of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship. In granting by majority vote any variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this Ordinance and 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4353 as referenced in the following paragraph shall be strictly followed:
"The Board of Appeals may grant a variance only when strict application of the Ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause undue hardship." These words, "undue hardship," as used in this subsection mean:
1. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted.
2. That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions of the neighborhood.
3. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality.
4. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner. Before granting approval of a side or rear yard setback variance that is less than fifteen
(15) feet from the property line or height variance that is more than thirty-four (34) feet, the Board of Appeals shall obtain a written statement from the Fire Chief concerning the effect of the proposed variance on fire safety.
703.5. Disability Variance
The Board may grant a variance to an owner of a dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling. The Board shall restrict any variance granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the person with the disability. The Board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives in the dwelling. For the purposes of this subsection, a disability has the same meaning as a physical or mental handicap under 5 M.R.S.A., § 4553, and is defined as any disability, infirmity, malformation, disfigurement, congenital defect or mental condition caused by bodily injury, accident, disease, birth defect, environmental conditions or illness; and also includes the physical or mental condition of a person which constitutes a substantial handicap as determined by a physician or, in the case of mental handicap, by a psychiatrist or psychologist, as well as any other health or sensory impairment which requires special education, vocational rehabilitation or related services, and the term "structures necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling" is defined to include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.

703.6. Setback Variance for Single-Family Dwelling
The Zoning Board may permit a setback variance only when strict application of the Zoning Ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner's property would cause undue hardship. The term "undue hardship" as used in this subsection means:
1. For a single-family dwelling, the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
2. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
3. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
4. The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of abutting property; and
5. That the granting of variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience, and no other feasible alternative is available.
A variance here is strictly limited to permitting a variance from a setback requirement for a single-family dwelling that is the primary year-round residence of the petitioner. A variance under this subsection may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of a setback requirement and may not be granted if the variance would cause the area of the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage. The petitioner may receive a variance under this subsection to exceed twenty percent (20%) of a setback requirement, except for minimum setbacks from a wetland or water body required within shoreland zones, if the petitioner has obtained the written consent of an affected abutting landowner.
703.7. Variance Recorded
If the Zoning Board grants a variance, a certificate indicating the name of the current property owner, identifying the property by reference to the last recorded deed in its chain of title and indicating the fact that a variance, including any conditions on the variance, has been granted and the date of the granting, shall be prepared in recordable form. This certificate must be recorded in the Knox County Registry of Deeds.
703.8. Miscellaneous Appeals
To hear and decide only the following miscellaneous appeals from the provisions of this Chapter. In granting such appeals by majority vote, the Board of Appeals may prescribe conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary.
1. To permit variations of nonconformance as authorized under Section 505 of this Ordinance.
2. To permit adjustments from the terms of this Ordinance with respect to curb cuts and off-street parking standards, provided such variances will not result in traffic, pedestrian or safety hazards.
704. Application Procedure
A complete application containing all the information requested in the ‘Board of Appeals Application’ and appropriate fee shall be submitted to the Planning Office at least fifteen (15) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting. Applicants should carefully follow the application procedure specific to their application/appeal and precisely tailor their application and supporting documentation to the specific requirements for administrative appeals, special exceptions, or variances.

Chapter 800 - General Standards of Performance
Amended June 12, 2018
www.town.rockport.me.us
8 - 15
1. One Entrance Per Lot. In order to minimize traffic congestion and conflict no more than one entrance per lot providing direct access onto Route 1 or Route 90 is permitted. The Planning Board shall have the authority to allow a separate entrance and exit for one driveway per lot in the event that the Planning Board determines that a separate entrance and exit are required to meet reasonable safety concerns which arise from a single entrance per lot providing direct access onto Route 1 or Route 90.
2. Shared Driveways. Owners of adjacent properties are encouraged to construct shared driveways. Road frontage requirements, as referenced in Rockport's Land Use Ordinance, may be reduced by 10% when abutting property owners share one driveway.
3. Turn-Around Area. Driveways must be designed with sufficient on-site turn- around area on the lot to enable a driver to exit the premises without backing onto Route 1 or Route 90.
4. Width of Driveways. The traveled portion of such driveways shall be no greater than eighteen (18) feet in width.
5. Turning Safety. Points of access and egress must be located to avoid hazardous conflicts with existing turning movements and traffic flows.
6. Angles. In order to minimize turning time and driver confusion, driveways that permit traffic flow for ingress and egress must intersect the road at an angle of or as near to ninety (90) degrees as site conditions will permit and in no case less than sixty (60) degrees. Driveways permitting one-way access for ingress or egress only shall form an angle of at least sixty (60) degrees with Route 1 or Route 90.
7. Corner Lots. Where a lot has frontage on two or more roads, the primary access to and egress from the lot must be provided to the road where the Planning Board determines there is less potential for traffic congestion and for traffic and pedestrian hazards.
8. Driveway Spacing. In order to minimize traffic accidents resulting from turning vehicles, the minimum distance between driveways must be seventy-five (75) feet measured from the centerlines of the driveways at the right-of-way line. This standard applies to driveways on the same lot or on adjoining lots. The Planning Board may reduce this requirement when the requirement cannot be met because of driveway location on adjacent lot(s) or because of topographic or other on-site conditions. Shared driveways are exempt from the driveway spacing requirement.
9. Minimum Setback from Intersections. To minimize accidents at intersections, driveways and road entrances/exits must be located at least one hundred (100) feet from the closest unsignalized intersection of Route 1 or Route 90 and another public road, and at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the closest signalized intersection of Route 1 or Route 90 and another public road. The Planning Board may reduce this requirement if the shape of the site does not allow conformity with this standard.
808.3 Traffic Access – Commercial, Multi-Family and All Other Uses (Route 1 and Route 90)
The following standards apply to the connections or intersection of driveways and other access ways with Route 1 or Route 90 which are established after June 14, 2000 for multi- family residential dwellings, subdivisions, and all other non-residential uses which require direct access to Route 1.

1. Access into the Site
a. Safe Sight Distance. Unless otherwise specified by the Maine Department of Transportation, any driveway or road must be located and designed so as to provide, to the maximum extent possible, a safe sight distance measured in each direction. Refer to current Maine Department of Transportation Entrance Rules for site distance standards.
Sight distance is measured from the driver's seat of a vehicle that is ten (10) feet behind the curb line (or edge of shoulder) with the height of eye three and one-half (3.5) feet above the pavement and height of an object four and one- quarter (4.25) feet above the pavement.
b. Turning Safety. The intersection of any driveway or proposed street must function:
(i) Adequately so that appropriate turning radii are provided to prevent tractor-trailer service vehicles or other large vehicles (buses, recreational vehicles, etc.) from encroaching into the opposing lane of travel where traffic is expected.
(ii) Adequately without creating excessive delay to through traffic on Route 1 or Route 90. Auxiliary turning lanes shall be installed where it is essential for public safety as determined by the Planning Board.
c. Angles. In order to minimize turning time and driver confusion, driveways which permit traffic flow for ingress and egress must intersect the road at an angle of or as near to ninety (90) degrees as site conditions will permit and in no case less than sixty (60) degrees. Driveways that permit one-way access for ingress only or egress only shall form an angle of at least sixty (60) degrees with Route 1 or Route 90.
d. Grades. Steep grades can cause accidents and create icy conditions on public roads. For driveways and proposed streets, the maximum grade is three percent (3%) for the first forty-five (45) feet from the edge of the existing road.
e. Driveway Turn-Around. Driveways must be designed with sufficient on-site turn-around area on the lot to enable a driver to exit the premises without backing onto the road. This standard is presumed to be met when a driveway terminates in an on-site parking lot.
f. Driveway Length. Driveways must be of sufficient length and in no case less than 75 feet to avoid the queuing of vehicles (vehicles waiting in line) on Route 1 or Route 90.
g. Corner Lots. Where a lot has frontage on two (2) or more roads, the primary access to and egress from the lot must be provided to the road where there is less potential for traffic congestion and for traffic and pedestrian hazards. Access from other streets may be provided if it is safe and does not promote shortcutting through the site.
h. Number of Access Points. Unchecked access points along Route 1 or Route 90 creates traffic hazards and increases congestion. The Maine Department of Transportation has specified standards for the number of access points intersecting or connecting with Route 1 and Route 90. Refer to current Maine Department of Transportation Entrance Rules for spacing standards.
i. The intersection of any driveway or proposed street must function:
(i) At a Level of Service D following development if the project will generate 1,000 or more vehicle trips per twenty-four (24) hour period; or

Land Use Ordinance
Chapter 800 - General Standards of Performance
Amended June 12, 2018
www.town.rockport.me.us
8 - 17
(ii) At a level that will allow safe access into and out of the project if less than one thousand (1,000) trips are generated.
j. Parking Lot Access. So as to minimize traffic conflicts, no parking lot or portion of a parking lot may be directly accessible from any public way. Ingress to and egress from parking areas must be limited to driveway entrances.
k. Right-Turn Deceleration Lane.
(i) Where a driveway serves as an entrance to a development containing fifty
(50) or more parking spaces and the adjacent arterial, either Route 1 or Route 90, has an average annual traffic volume (A.A.D.T.) exceeding 7,500 vehicles, a deceleration lane shall be provided, where suitable frontage exists, for traffic turning right into the driveway from the arterial. The deceleration lane shall be at least two hundred (200) feet long, not including taper, and at least twelve (12) feet wide measured from the road edge or curb line.
(ii) The Planning Board may also require a deceleration lane where: (1) a traffic impact study determines a right-turn lane is necessary to meet the level-of- service criteria; or (2) at any intersection where the accident experience, existing traffic operations or engineering judgment indicates a significant hazard to right-turning vehicles; or (3) meets minimum volume warrants for right-turn lanes.
l. Left-Turn Lane. The Planning Board may require that the applicant construct a left-turn lane when the Planning Board can document, through an independent traffic study conducted at the expense of the applicant, that such treatment is necessary to avoid conflicts with through traffic, congestion or other unsafe conditions on the arterial, as set forth in the Maine Highway Design Manual, 1990 edition or later. To determine whether a left-turn lane is warranted, the independent traffic study shall include a determination of the advancing, opposing, and left-turning volumes at the point of access, and such determinations shall be determined based on the standards contained in the Maine Highway Design Manual, 1990 edition or later
2. Driveway Location and Spacing
a. Driveway Spacing. In order to minimize traffic accidents resulting from turning vehicles, the minimum distance between driveways must be seventy- five (75) feet measured from the centerlines of the driveways at the right-of- way line. This standard applies to driveways on the same lot or on adjoining lots. The Planning Board may reduce this requirement when the requirement cannot be met because of driveway location on adjacent lot(s) or because of topographic or other on-site conditions. Shared driveways are exempt from the driveway spacing requirement.
b. Shared Driveways. Road frontage requirements, as referenced in Rockport's Land Use Ordinance, may be reduced by 10% when abutting property owners share one driveway.
c. Minimum Setback from Intersections. To minimize accidents at intersections, driveways and road entrances/exits must be located at least one hundred
(100) feet from the closest unsignalized intersection of Route 1 or Route 90 and another public road, and at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the closest signalized intersection of Route 1 or Route 90 and another public road. The Planning Board may reduce this requirement if the shape of the site does not allow conformity with this standard.

d. Commercial or Residential Subdivision Access. In order to minimize future road congestion and avoid traffic conflicts, in the event that a proposed subdivision, as subject to the Rockport Land Use Ordinance or subject to Title 30-A MRSA Sections 4401-4407, has access to Route 1 or Route 90, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Permitted Access. Access to the development shall include one of the following:
(a) One driveway leading to a common frontage road running parallel to Route 1 or Route 90. The sideline of such common frontage road closest to Route 1 or Route 90 shall be least fifty (50) feet from the nearest sideline of Route 1 or Route 90.
(b) A common driveway, which shall intersect Route 1or Route 90, and which serves the individual lots or businesses or a common parking lot adjacent to the individual lots or businesses; or
(c) One or more minor roads, to be constructed by the developer, to serve the development.
(ii) Prohibited Access. Direct access from Route 1 or Route 90 to any individual lot is not permitted unless the Planning Board grants a waiver after finding that one or more of the following conditions is met:
(a) There is too little road frontage to reasonably allow creation of a new road;
(b) The shape or physical condition of the parcel does not permit access to or creation of a street other than Route 1; or
(c) A common access or shared driveway will be utilized to serve proposed lots.
3. On-Site Vehicle Circulation
a. Truck Loading/Unloading. In order to minimize traffic back-ups caused by parked delivery vehicles, non-residential uses that will be served by delivery vehicles must provide a clear route for such vehicles with appropriate design to allow for on-site turning and backing.
b. Emergency Vehicle Access. For public health and safety purposes, clear routes of access must be provided and maintained for emergency vehicles to and around buildings and must be posted with appropriate signage (e.g., fire lane - no parking).
c. Loading Docks. Loading docks must not be located on any street frontage. Provision for handling all freight must be on those sides of any buildings that do not face on any street or proposed streets.
d. Inter-Connections
(i) For all uses, provision for vehicular connections to existing or future uses on adjacent properties shall be encouraged wherever feasible and to the maximum extent possible so as to minimize the traffic exit/enter movements.
(ii) Where appropriate and feasible, shared circulation roads for major non- residential projects shall be located between 150 feet and 300 feet from the main highway in order to avoid intersection conflicts.

Construction or enlargement of a foundation beneath the existing structure shall not be considered an expansion of the structure provided that whenever a new, enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals, basing its decision on the criteria specified in Section 1412.3.2, Relocation, below; and that if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except for expansion in conformity with Section 1412.3.1.a above, and that the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.
c. No structure that is less than the required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland shall be expanded toward the water body, tributary stream, or wetland.
2. Relocation: A non-conforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules , or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more non- conforming.
In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on- site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Zoning Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replaced with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:
a. Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five

trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed.
Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.
b. Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel, the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
3. Reconstruction or Replacement: Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within one year of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with the purpose of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity.
If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Section 1412.3.1, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with Section
1412.3.2 above.
Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place within one year if a Building Permit is obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer.
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback requirement to the greatest practical extent, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider, in addition to the criteria in Section 1412.3.2, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.
4. Change of Use of a Non-Conforming Structure: The use of a non-conforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Zoning Board of Appeals, after receiving a written application, determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than the existing use.
In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public

access to waters, natural beauty, flood plain management, archaeological and historic resources, and commercial fishing and maritime activities, and other functionally water-dependent uses, and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall also determine whether the standards set forth in Section 1416.4 (1 through 9) have been met.
Non-conforming Uses
1. Expansions: Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that non- conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in Section 1412.3.
2. Resumption Prohibited: A lot, building or structure in or on which a non- conforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use except that the Zoning Board of Appeals may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year extension to that time period. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five (5) year period.
3. Change of Use: An existing non-conforming use may be changed to another non- conforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources, including water dependent uses in the Rockport Downtown District 913, than the former use, as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed in Section 1412.3.4, above.
Non-conforming Lots
1. Non-conforming Lots: A non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width and shore frontage can be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot width or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12
M.R.S.A. § 4807) and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two or more principal uses or structures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this Ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided, each lot thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
3. Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Built: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain no principal structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.

1413. Establishment of Shoreland Overlay Districts
Shoreland Districts intentionally overlay and embrace underlying land use districts and where the provisions of the overlay districts conflict with those of the underlying districts, the stricter provisions shall prevail.
Resource Protection District
The Resource Protection District includes areas in which development would adversely affect water quality, productive habitat, biological ecosystems, or scenic and natural values. This district shall include the following areas when they occur within the limits of the shoreland zone, exclusive of the Stream Protection District, except that areas that are currently developed need not be included in the Resource Protection District.
1. Areas within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of freshwater wetlands, salt marshes and salt meadows, and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers, which are rated “moderate” or “high” value, by the Maine Department of Island Fisheries and Wildlife as of January 1, 1973.
NOTE: The Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. § 480-A -Z, requires the Department of Environmental Protection to designate areas of “significant wildlife habitat.” Significant wildlife habitat includes: Habitat for species appearing on the official state or federal lists of endangered or threatened species; high and moderate value deer wintering areas and travel corridors as defined by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife; high and moderate value waterfowl and wading bird habitats, including nesting and feeding areas as defined by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife; critical spawning and nursery areas for Atlantic sea run salmon as defined by the Atlantic Sea Run Salmon Commission; and shorebird nesting, feeding and staging areas and seabird nesting islands as defined by the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
2. Flood plains along rivers and flood plains along artificially formed great ponds along rivers, defined by the 100-year flood plain as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils. This district shall also include 100-year flood plains adjacent to tidal waters as shown on FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps.
3. Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres with sustained slopes of 20% or greater.
4. Areas of two (2) or more contiguous acres supporting wetland vegetation and hydric soils, which are not part of a freshwater or coastal wetland as defined, and which are not surficially connected to a water body during the period of normal spring high water.
NOTE: These areas usually consist of forested wetlands abutting water bodies and non-forested wetlands.
5. Land areas along rivers subject to severe bank erosion, undercutting, or river bed movement and lands adjacent to tidal waters that are subject to severe erosion or mass movement, such as steep coastal bluffs.
Stream Protection District
The Stream Protection District includes all land areas within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a stream, exclusive of those areas within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a great pond or river, or within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the upland edge of a freshwater or coastal wetland. Where a stream and its associated shoreland area are located within two hundred fifty (250) feet, horizontal distance, of the above water bodies or wetlands, that land area shall be regulated under the terms of the shoreland district associated with that water body or wetland.

Section 607 of the Rockport Land Use Ordinance and 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4452.
c. Within a shoreland area zoned for Resource Protection abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of vegetation within the strip of land extending 100 feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high- water line, except to remove safety hazards, without first obtaining a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer. Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection District the clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that District.
2. Except in areas as described in Section 1415.16.1, above, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high- water line of a great pond and 75 feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream, tidal waters or the upland edge of a wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
a. There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy as measured from the outer limits of the tree crown. However, a footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created.
b. Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed provided that a well distributed stand of trees and other vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of this Section, a "well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation" adjacent to a great pond or stream shall be defined as maintaining a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular (1,250 square feet) area as determined by the following rating system:
Diameter of Tree at 4½
feet Above Ground Level (inches)
2 – < 4 in. 1
4 - < 8 in. 2
8 - < 12 in. 4
12 in. or greater 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a "well- distributed stand of trees and other vegetation" is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area.
In each rectangular plot established pursuant to this section, at least five
(5) saplings less than 2 inches in diameter at four and one-half feet above ground level for each 25 foot by 50 ft. rectangular area shall be retained. If five (5) saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two inches in diameter shall be removed until five (5) saplings have been added to the rectangular plot.
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
(i.) The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;

(iv.) Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(v.) Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25- foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at 4½ feet above ground level, may be removed in any ten (10) year period.
c. In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered or removed except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in Sections
1415.16.2 and 1415.16.2a, above.
d. Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is allowed.
e. In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe, or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present.
The provisions contained in Section 1415.16.2 above shall not apply to those portions of public recreational facilities adjacent to public swimming areas and the Rockport Harbor located on Tax Map 29B Lots 091 and 309. Cleared areas, however, shall be limited to the minimum area necessary.
f. Within Shoreland Districts at distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from a great pond and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of any other water body, tributary stream, or the upland edge of a wetland, except to allow for the development of permitted uses, there shall be permitted on any lot, in any ten (10) year period, selective cutting of not more than forty
(40) percent of the volume of trees four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured four and one-half (4-1/2) feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards, volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
3. Clearing Limitation: In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to, principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) of the lot area within the shoreland zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously cleared.

Excavation, moving, placement or removal of volumes in excess of ten (10) cubic yards of soil material or enlargement of cleared areas shall require a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.
5. Fields and other cleared openings that have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees, or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of this Section and shall require a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer.
Erosion and Sedimentation Control
1. All activities that involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities that result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall also require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. The plan shall be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and shall include, where applicable, provisions for:
a. Mulching and revegetation of disturbed soil.
b. Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, silt fencing or diversion ditches.
c. Permanent stabilization structures such as retaining walls or riprap.
2. In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
3. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.
4. Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure. In addition:
a. Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.
b. Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.
c. Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.
5. Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from erosion from water flowing through them.

nonresidents and entitles the holder to dig and take no more than one peck of
shellfish in any one day for personal use.
