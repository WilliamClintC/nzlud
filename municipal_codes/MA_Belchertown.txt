§ 38-2 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 38-4
27:52
§ 38-5. Resolution of disputes.

If any part of this article is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or

Town of Belchertown hereby declares the provisions of this article to be
severable.
"It is the desire of the Town of Belchertown to conserve, protect and
encourage the maintenance and improvement of agricultural land for
the production of food and other agricultural products, and also for its
natural and ecological value. This disclosure notification is to inform
buyers that the property they are about to acquire lies within a town
where farming activities occur. Such farming activities may include,
but are not limited to, activities that cause noise, dust and odors.
Purchasing and occupying land within Belchertown means that one
should expect and accept such conditions as a normal and necessary
aspect of living in Belchertown."
The Belchertown Agricultural Commission will make available for use
by selling landowners or their agents and assigns copies of written
example notification, and make suggestions on their dissemination for
notification purposes.

article. This procedure is notwithstanding the pursuit of other available
remedies through Town bylaws and regulations, state statutes and
regulations, or legal remedy. The Town Administrator will forward
farming complaints to the Agricultural Commission (and other Town
board or officer as appropriate). The Agricultural Commission will seek
an amicable resolution through facilitating discussion between the
parties, and will issue its recommendations to the Town Administrator.
A.
Complaints about a farm or farming activity filed with other
deliberative Town boards and/or officials will be copied to the
Agricultural Commission as information only. The Commission will not

§ 51-4 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 51-5
42:56
§ 51-6. Limits and exemptions.
In passing upon matters before it, the Commission shall consider,
among other things, the historic and architectural value and
significance of the site, building or structure; the general design,
arrangement, texture, material and color of the features involved;
and the relation of such features to similar features of buildings
and structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new
construction or additions to existing buildings or structures, the
Commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size, shape
and material of the building or structure, both in relation to the
land area upon which the building or structure is situated and
to the buildings or structures in the vicinity, and the Commission
may, in appropriate cases, impose dimensional and setback
requirements in addition to those required by applicable zoning
bylaws.
(1)
In passing upon applications for a certificate of appropriateness,
the local Historic District Commission shall refer to historical
scholarship based on original sources, historic photographs or
other visual documentation and the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation in order to evaluate the proposed
changes.
(2)
Exceptions. The Commission may determine from time to time, after
public hearing, that certain categories of exterior architectural
features, structures or signs may be constructed or altered without
review by the Commission. The Commission may, after public hearing,
set forth the various designs of certain appurtenances, such as lighting
fixtures, which will meet the requirements of the Historic District, but
no such determination shall limit the right of an applicant to present
other designs to the Commission for its approval.
E.
The Historic District Commission shall not make any recommendations
or requirement with regard to new construction, reconstructions or
additions, except for the purpose of preventing development
incongruous with the historic aspects and/or architectural
characteristics of the surroundings and of the Historic District.
A.
The following elements shall be exempt from review by the Historic
District Commission, as provided under MGL c. 40C, § 8.

with artificial siding, shall require the review and approval of the
Historic District Commission as set forth in this chapter.

§ 51-7. Applications for certificates.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance, repair or replacement of any exterior architectural
feature within an historic district which does not involve a change
in design, material, color or outward appearance, nor to prevent
landscaping with plants, trees and shrubs, nor to prevent the meeting
of requirements certified by a duly authorized public official to be
necessary for public safety, nor to prevent any construction or
alteration under a permit duly issued prior to the effective date of this
chapter.
C.
Except as this chapter provides in § 51-5, no building or structure
within the Historic District shall be constructed or altered in any way
that affects exterior architectural features unless the Commission shall
first have issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of
nonapplicability or a certificate of hardship with respect to such
construction or alteration, nor shall any building permit or permit for
demolition be issued by the town or any department thereof for any
building or structure within the Historic District until the certificate
required by this section has been issued by the Commission.
A.
Applications for certificates shall be made in triplicate, one copy being
filed with the Historic District Commission, one copy with the Building
Inspector and one copy with the Town Clerk. Applications shall be in
the form specified by the Commission, to include plans and elevations,
signed by the draftsman or architect, drawn to scale, detailed enough
to show the architectural design of the structure and its relation to
existing buildings, and other materials deemed necessary by the
Commission. Plot and site plans should be filed when the applicant
proposes improvements affecting appearances, such as walks, fences,
steps and paving. In the case of demolition or removal, the applicant
must include a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of
the property thereafter.
B.

Commission shall determine whether the application involves any
features which are subject to review and/or approval by the
Commission.

of the applicant, the Commission shall hold a public hearing, unless
waived according to MGL c. 40C, as amended. Public notice of the time,
place and purposes of the hearing shall be given at least 14 days in
advance, and the Commission shall notify by mail all affected parties as
provided in MGL c. 40C, as amended.

42:58
§ 51-8. Applicability to town.
The Town of Belchertown shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter,
notwithstanding any town bylaw to the contrary.
§ 51-9. Amendments.
A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued to the applicant if the
Commission determines that the proposed construction or alteration
will be appropriate and compatible with the preservation and
protection of the Historic District. In the case of disapproval of an
application for a certificate for appropriateness, the Commission shall
place upon its record the reasons for such determination and shall
forthwith cause a notice of its determination, accompanied by a copy
of the reasons therefor as set forth in the records of the Commission,
to be issued to the applicant, and the Commission may make
recommendations for changes in the applicant's proposal which, if
made, would make the application acceptable to the Commission. If,
within 14 days of receipt of such notice, the applicant files a written
modification of his application in conformity with the changes
recommended by the Commission, the Commission shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness to the applicant.
F.
Upon request, the Commission may issue a certificate of
nonapplicability to any applicant whose proposed work does not require
Commission approval.
G.
If an application is deemed inappropriate or if application is specifically
made for a certificate of hardship, the Commission may issue a
certificate of hardship if conditions especially affecting the building
or structure involved, but not affecting the Historic District generally,
would result in a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the
applicant and if approval would not result in a substantial detriment
to the public welfare. A certificate of hardship shall also be issued in
the event that the Commission does not make a determination on an
application within the time specified in this chapter.
H.
Each certificate issued by the Historic District Commission shall be
dated and signed by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary or such
other person designated by the Commission to sign certificates on
its behalf. The Commission shall keep a permanent record of its
determinations, the vote of each member participating therein and the
reasons for determination and shall file a copy of notice of certificates
and determinations or disapproval with the Town Clerk and Building
Inspector.

litigation costs only if the Commission is found to have acted in bad
faith, with malice or with gross negligence.

Board, Board of Selectmen and the Town Accountant.
[4]
If a member of the Sick Leave Bank uses all of his/her
sick time due to illness or other permissible use and has
exhausted all of his/her personal and vacation time, he/she
may receive additional sick leave days from the Sick Leave
Bank for legitimate reasons, as deemed by the Committee,
until such time as he/she accrues more sick leave days
of his/her own or exceeds the limits defined below.
[Amended 5-14-2001 ATM by Art. 28]
Each eligible, benefited employee covered by this
chapter may become a member of the Sick Leave Bank
by donating three sick leave days to the bank within
45 calendar days of his/her permanent, benefited
employment under this chapter (after the six-month
probationary period). Each member of the Sick Leave
Bank will also agree to donate three additional days at
the beginning of each fiscal year thereafter, plus any
days assessed by the Sick Leave Bank Committee. A
member may cease membership with the bank for a
subsequent fiscal year by giving written notice to the
Sick Leave Bank Committee and the Town Accountant
by June 15 prior to the beginning of that fiscal year.
[a]
[5]
§ 91-6 OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES § 91-6
85:89
Each member of the Sick Leave Bank may receive up
to 30 days of sick leave from the bank per fiscal year
upon approval of the Sick Leave Bank Committee.
Additional days of sick leave from the bank may be
granted by a majority vote of the membership of the
Sick Leave Bank. If it is not feasible to receive this
approval or vote prior to a member's absence, the
Town Accountant may withhold the Sick Leave Bank of
the employee for the days in question until such time
as a decision has been made. If the Sick Leave Bank
Committee or membership approves, the days shall be
deducted from the bank's total, and the employee shall
be paid his/her Sick Leave Bank in full for the days in
question.
[b]
If the number of sick leave days in the bank is
depleted below 60 days, up to three additional days
for the bank may be assessed each member. No more
than six days may be assessed in any one fiscal year.
[c]
If the sick leave days in the bank equal or exceed 300
days at the end of the fiscal year, the past members of
the bank will not be required to donate any additional
days to maintain membership for the following fiscal
year.
[d]
If an employee who once decided not to join the Sick
Leave Bank decides to join in a subsequent year, his/
her initial donation to the bank must equal the total
number of days that he/she would have donated to the
bank through the years had he/she joined initially. In
no case will this initial donation exceed 15 days.
[e]
No member of the Sick Leave Bank will be denied
continuation of membership in the bank because he/
she has no sick leave days of his/her own to donate
to the bank when additional assessments are made for
the bank. His/her assessment will be made up at the
beginning of the following fiscal year.
[f]
On September 1 of each fiscal year, the Sick Leave
Bank Committee will inform the Town Accountant's
office, in writing, of the number of sick leave days
donated by each member to the bank and the number
of days accrued by the bank itself according to its
records. The Town Accountant's office will advise, in
writing, the Sick Leave Bank Committee of the
number of sick days accumulated by each member.

All sick leave days accrued by a member of the Sick
Leave Bank over and above the maximum number of

(currently 180 days) shall automatically be placed in
the Sick Leave Bank at the beginning of each fiscal
year.
The granting of sick leave from the bank shall be subject
to the same criteria as regular sick leave days and shall
be in all other respects consistent with the Town of
Belchertown's sick leave policy; provided, however, that
such sick leave shall be available only for the illness of the
Town employee and not for illness of his/her family.
[6]
Employees who are receiving workers' compensation
provided by statute shall not be eligible to apply for sick
leave from the bank.
[7]

Curb cuts  See Ch. 114, Art. I. Subdivision of land  See Ch. 270.
§ 97-1. Authority.
Statutory provisions of the Scenic Road Act, MGL c. 40, § 15C: "Upon
recommendation or request of the Planning Board, Conservation
Commission, or Historical Commission of any city or town, such city or town
may designate any road in said city or town other than a numbered route or
state highway, as a scenic road.
After a road has been designated as a scenic road, any repair,
maintenance, reconstruction, or paving work done with respect thereto
shall not involve or include the cutting or removal of trees, or the tearing
down or destruction of stone walls, or portions thereof, except with prior
written consent of the Planning Board ... after a public hearing duly
advertised twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the areas, as to
time, date, place, and purpose, the last publication to occur at least seven
days prior to such hearings; provided, however, that when a public hearing
must be held under the provisions of this section and under section three
of Chapter 87 (Public Shade Tree Act) prior to cutting or removal of a tree,
such hearings shall be consolidated into a single public hearing before the
Tree Warden and the Planning Board ... and notice of such consolidated
public hearing shall be given by the Tree Warden or his deputy as provided
in said section three of Chapter 87.
Designation of a road as scenic road shall not affect the eligibility of a
city or town to receive construction or reconstruction aid for such road
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter ninety."
§ 97-2. Purpose.
In accordance with the Belchertown Community Plan, the purpose of this
chapter is to maintain Belchertown's rural New England look and feel:
To maintain and enhance the rural character of historic and scenic town
roads through the preservation of mature trees and stone walls;
A.
To "avoid suburban style road sides" by maintaining the natural beauty
that exists along scenic roads and encouraging new development that
is compatible with existing road side features;
B.
To implement more fully the provisions of the Scenic Road Act, with
acknowledgement that roads serve transportation function for
pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians as well as motorized vehicles.

97:101
§ 97-3. Definitions.
For terms not qualified in MGL c. 40, § 15C, of the Massachusetts General
Laws the following meanings shall apply for the purposes of this chapter:
CUTTING OR REMOVAL OF TREES  The removal of one or more trees,
trimming of major branches or cutting of roots sufficient in the Tree
Warden's written opinion to cause eventual destruction of a tree. It does not
include clearing nuisance growth, routine or emergency tree maintenance
which removes only permanently diseased or damaged limbs, trunks or
roots and dead whole trees or thinning overcrowded trees as determined by
the Tree Warden.
REPAIR, MAINTENANCE, RECONSTRUCTION, OR PAVING WORK  Any
work done within the right-of-way by any person or agency, public or
private. Construction of new driveways or alteration of existing ones is
included, in so far as it takes place within the right-of-way. Construction or
alteration of water, sewer, electric, telephone, cable TV, or other utilities
within the right-of-way is also included.
ROAD  A vehicular traveled way plus its necessary appurtenances within
the right-of-way, including bridge structures, drainage systems, retaining
walls, traffic control devices, and sidewalks, but not intersecting streets or
driveways. The right-of-way includes the area on and within the boundaries
of the public way and the air space above. If the boundaries are not officially
known, any affected tree or stone wall shall be presumed to be within the
public right-of-way until shown to be otherwise.
TEARING DOWN OR DESTRUCTION OF STONE WALLS  The destruction
of more than 10 linear feet of stone wall involving more than one cubic foot
of wall material per linear foot above existing grade. Temporary removal
and replacement of a stone wall, within a reasonable period of time, not
to exceed six months, at the same location with the same materials is
permitted without Planning Board approval if the Town Highway
Department is notified before the work begins. Repair of a stone wall not
involving removal and/or destruction is not covered by this chapter.
TREES  Includes a tree whose trunk has a diameter of four inches or more
as measured four feet above the ground. Nothing in this definition shall be
construed to permit a person, other than the Tree Warden or his deputy, to
trim, cut down or remove a public shade tree more than one and one-half
inch in diameter one foot from the ground.
§ 97-4. Criteria for designation as scenic road.
In determining which roads or portions of roads should be recommended to
Town Meeting for designation as scenic roads, the following criteria shall
be considered:

preservation of rural character and scenic beauty, public safety, and
efficient road maintenance.

Commission and the public by advertising twice in a newspaper of
general circulation, the first advertisement to appear at least 14 days
prior to the public hearing. The Planning Board shall make a

§ 112-1. Background.
Land uses in Town affect our streams, lakes and drinking water
supplies. Land development and other land use conversions, and their
associated changes to land cover, have the potential to permanently
alter the function of local watersheds, resulting in increased
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding,
stream channel erosion, sediment transport and discharge, and
nonpoint source pollution, and decrease groundwater recharge.
Adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the
application of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) and lowimpact
development principles.
A.
Low-impact development (LID) seeks a balance between human
activities and protecting habitat and important natural resources. It
is about maintaining environmental quality of life that gives the
communities we live in a sense of place. The goal of LID is to integrate
human development into the landscape in a way that is mindful of
natural ecosystems and does not disrupt the complex hydrologic cycle
that maintains them. LID can be applied through development density,
reduced impervious surface coverage, lot size, open space/tree
retention, street design, street width, parking design, sidewalks, and
stormwater management practices. Because LID involves a
comprehensive approach, it must be integrated into municipal policies,
regulations, and development standards in order for it to be effective.
B.
Careful planning of development, redevelopment, and land conversion
projects will protect the quality and health of the water resources
of Belchertown. Therefore, the Town of Belchertown enacts this
Stormwater Management Bylaw to prevent potential harmful impacts
from land development activities.
C.
In addition, localities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are
required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws,
bylaws and permits which require a locality to address the impacts
of construction site runoff, post-development stormwater runoff, and
nonpoint source pollution.

§ 112-2. Purpose.
Therefore, the Town of Belchertown has established this chapter to
provide reasonable guidance for site planning and stormwater
management for the purpose of protecting local water resources from
degradation. This chapter addresses construction and postconstruction
stormwater runoff from new development and
redevelopment projects.
E.
This chapter is not retroactive and does not affect current or approved
land development or redevelopment applications.
F.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare by establishing requirements and
procedures to control the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff from
new development and redevelopment. The objectives of the chapter are
to:
Establish regulations for land development activities that preserve
the health of water resources by reducing the adverse water
quality impacts from stormwater discharges to rivers, lakes,
reservoirs, and streams in order to attain federal water quality
standards;
(1)
Require that new development, redevelopment and all land
conversion activities maintain the natural hydrologic
characteristics of the land in order to reduce flooding, stream bank
erosion, siltation, nonpoint source pollution, property damage, and
to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(2)
Prevent the discharge of pollutants, including hazardous
chemicals, into stormwater runoff;
(3)
Minimize the volume and rate of stormwater discharges to rivers,
lakes, reservoirs, and streams during and following development;
(4)
Prevent erosion and sedimentation from land development, and
reduce stream channel erosion caused by increased runoff;
(5)
Provide for the recharge of groundwater aquifers and maintain the
base flow of streams;
(6)
Encourage the use of LID practices such as reducing impervious
cover and the preservation of green space and other natural areas,
to the maximum extent practicable;
(7)
Coordinate site design plans, which include green space, with the
Town's green space protection plan;
(8)
Provide stormwater management facilities that are attractive,
maintain the natural integrity of the environment, and are designed
to protect public safety;

§ 112-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALTER  Any activity, which will measurably change the ability of a ground
surface area to absorb water or will change existing surface drainage
patterns. Alter may be similarly represented as "alteration of drainage
characteristics," and "conducting land disturbance activities."
APPLICANT  A property owner or agent of a property owner who has filed
an application for a stormwater management permit.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Structural, nonstructural and
managerial techniques that are recognized to be the most effective and
practical means to prevent and/or reduce increases in stormwater volumes
and flows, reduce point source and nonpoint source pollution, and promote
stormwater quality and protection of the environment. Structural BMPs are
devices that are engineered and constructed to provide temporary storage
and treatment of stormwater runoff. Nonstructural BMPs use natural
measures to reduce pollution levels, do not require extensive construction
efforts, and/or promote pollutant reduction by eliminating the pollutant
source.
BETTER SITE DESIGN  Site design approaches and techniques that can
reduce a site's impact on the watershed through the use of nonstructural
stormwater management practices. Better site design includes conserving
and protecting natural areas and green space, reducing impervious cover,
and using natural features for stormwater management.
Require that the amount and quality of stormwater runoff from new
development is equal to or better than pre-development conditions
in order to reduce flooding, stream erosion, pollution, property
damage, and harm to aquatic life;
(10)
Establish maintenance provisions to ensure that stormwater
treatment practices will continue to function as designed and pose
no threat to public safety;
(11)
Establish procedures for the Town's review of stormwater
management plans, and for the Town's inspection of approved
stormwater controls;
(12)
Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to
stormwater discharges.
(13)
Nothing in this chapter is intended to replace the requirements of
the Town of Belchertown Wetlands Protection Bylaw,8 or any other
bylaw that may be adopted by the Town of Belchertown. Any activity
subject to the provisions of the above-cited bylaws must comply with
the specifications of each.

Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety
and welfare of the community by protecting and preserving the
groundwater resources of Belchertown from any use of land or
structures which reduce the quality or quantity of its water resources.
A.
Scope of authority. The Aquifer Protection District is an overlay district
and shall be superimposed on the other districts established by this
chapter. All uses, dimensional requirements and other provisions of this
chapter applicable to such underlying districts shall remain in force
and effect, except that where the Aquifer Protection District imposes
greater or additional restrictions and requirements, such restrictions
or requirements shall prevail. Any uses not permitted in underlying
districts shall remain prohibited.
B.
Establishment of district. The Aquifer Protection District is herein
established to include all specified lands within the Town of
Belchertown. The intent of the Aquifer Protection District is to include
lands lying within the primary recharge areas of groundwater aquifers
which provide public water supply. The map entitled "Aquifer
Protection District," Town of Belchertown, on file with the Town Clerk,
delineates the boundaries of the district. Where the bounds delineated
are in doubt or in dispute, the burden of proof shall be upon the
owner(s) of the land in question to show where they should be properly
located. At the request of the owner(s), the Town may engage a
professional hydrogeologist to determine more accurately the location
and extent of an aquifer or primary recharge area. In the case of a
determination by a hydrogeologist that the bounds delineated on the
above said map are incorrect for the property in question, the Town
shall pay for the investigation. In the case of a determination by a
hydrogeologist that the bounds delineated on the above said map are
correct for the property in question, the owner(s) shall pay for the
investigation.

done solely for the purpose of altering the allowed height of
the sign. The Building Commissioner or Zoning Enforcement
Officer may permit a sign in height greater than the standards
listed in Table E-1 where the physical characteristics of the lot
prevent adequate setback from public ways and a lower sign
would create a potential traffic hazard. See Figure E-4 below.

with traffic visibility and shall not protrude over any lot line.
(2)
Any illumination provided shall be of one color only, for example,
only white, or only red, but not both.
(3)
Any sign illuminated by an external light source shall have the light
source projected downward from above and shall be shielded from
view off the premises so that no direct light extends above ground
level beyond the property lines on which the sign is located.
(4)
No sign shall constitute a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic
because of the intensity or direction of illumination.

Light fixtures, including bulbs or tubes, used for sign illumination
should be selected and positioned to achieve the desired brightness
of the sign with the minimum possible wattage while ensuring
compliance with all applicable requirements of this section. Where
possible, the fixtures used for sign illumination should classify as
"energy efficient," as defined by the power utility company serving
the lot.
(8)
The following types of signs with internal or quasi-internal
illumination shall be permitted, provided that they comply with all
applicable standards of this section. The word "opaque," as used in
the following subsections, shall mean that the opaque object shall
appear black when the sign is lit at night.
Neon signs, erected on a lot in place of a sign otherwise
permitted, provided it features an individualized, custom made
design showing only a drawing, logo, symbol or illustration,
but not letters. A neon sign hereunder shall comply with all
applicable dimensional standards. It shall be composed of
primarily single-strand glass tubing with a maximum one-inch
diameter.
(a)
Opaque individual letter signs or symbols, back-lit with a white
and concealed light source, thereby creating an effect by which
the letters or symbols are silhouetted against a wall
illuminated by said light source.
(b)
Signs featuring individual letters or symbols which are cut out
from an opaque facing and back-lit with a white and concealed
light source, thereby creating an effect by which the facing,
from which the letters or symbols are cut out, is silhouetted
against a wall illuminated by said light source.
(c)
Back-lit awning signs with the light source internal or
concealed from public view. Such signs shall not be permitted
in the Historic District.
(d)
Individual letter signs with translucent letter faces, internally

permit granting authority may grant a special permit for one
additional freestanding sign if such additional sign is
determined necessary due to the specific combination of uses
on the lot.
(c)
Freestanding signs may be lighted on both sides. Any
illumination provided for signs shall conform to the

139:210
landscaped area located on the lot or parcel with a minimum
area in square feet to be equal to the overall height of the sign
multiplied by two, by the power of two. (Example: sign height
= six feet: six feet x two feet = 12 feet.; 12 feet x 12 feet =
144 square feet = minimum landscaped area) Such landscaped
area shall be planted and maintained with suitable vegetation,
including shrubs and flowering perennials surrounding the
base of the freestanding sign. The landscaped area required
under this section may be provided as part of a landscaped
area required under any other section of this section.

(2)
Compatibility. Proposed signs will be considered in relation to the
character of the neighborhood and the architecture, colors and
material of the building and should be compatible in terms of
the appropriateness of the size, color, shape, material and design.
Signs should be informative, legible and designed to improve the
quality of the street scene.
(3)
Discontinuance of sign-related use. All signs erected for a
permitted use, use by a special permit or a special event, including

shall be removed or repaired by the owner of the sign or the owner
of the premises.
(3)
Removal of signs by the Building Commissioner or Zoning
Enforcement Officer.
The Building Commissioner or Zoning Enforcement Officer

detract from the character of the existing land use.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow as a permitted use, upon
the issuance of a zoning permit, home occupations which comply with
the standards set forth below. The purposes of these standards are to
assist in ensuring the residential characteristics of the neighborhoods
in which home occupations are located.
B.
Procedure.
Home occupations are permitted by a zoning permit issued upon
application to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
(1)
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue a zoning permit only
after making a determination that the application conforms to the
standards in Subsection D.

(1)
F.
§ 145-27 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-27
139:224
If the proposal requires a special permit, it must conform to
the special permit requirements as listed in § 145-69 of this
chapter.
(a)
The development shall be integrated into the existing terrain
and surrounding landscape and shall be designed to protect
abutting properties and community amenities. Building sites
shall, to the extent feasible:
Minimize use of wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains and
hilltops;
[1]
Minimize obstruction of scenic views from publicly

[3] Preserve unique natural or historic features;
Minimize tree, vegetation and soil removal and grade
changes;
[4]
[5] Maximize open space retention; and
Screen objectionable features, such as lighting, utility
structures, outdoor storage or other such features, from
neighboring properties and roadways.
[6]
(b)
The development shall be served with adequate water supply
and waste disposal systems. "Adequate" means the
development shall not place an excessive demand on public
infrastructure and resources.
(c)
The plan shall maximize the convenience and safety of
vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site and in
relation to adjacent ways. Sidewalks must be shown along the
applicant's frontage adjacent to public ways, and shall meet,

pollution of surface water or groundwater, to minimize erosion
and sedimentation and to prevent changes in groundwater
levels, increased runoff and potential for flooding. Drainage
shall be designed so that runoff shall not be increased,
groundwater recharge is maximized and neighboring
properties will not be adversely affected.
(e)
Exposed storage areas, machinery, service areas, truck loading
areas, utility buildings and structures and other unsightly uses
shall be set back or screened to protect the neighbors from
these objectionable features.
(f)
In all cases, setback and dimensions as described in Article V
of the Zoning Bylaw must be honored and cannot be waived.
(g)
§ 145-27 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-27
139:225
The site plan shall comply with all zoning requirements for
parking, loading and environmental performance standards
and all provisions of this chapter. However, strict compliance
with any zoning bylaw governing any individual aspect of a site
plan, other than setbacks and dimensions, may be waived by
the Planning Board where such action is in not detrimental to
the public good. In such cases, any waiver on a site plan with
approval from the Planning Board supersedes the individual
bylaw governing the waiver. If the applicant requests a waiver,
it is incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate the viability
of the proposed waiver. The Planning Board reserves the right
to request a waiver when the Board deems it appropriate, even
if the applicant does not request a waiver.
The site plan shall demonstrate compliance with § 145-41
(Commercial development and architectural design). [Added
5-12-2014 ATM by Art. 20]
(h)
Before approval of a site plan, the Planning Board may request
the applicant to make modifications in the proposed design of the
project to ensure that the above criteria are met.
(2)
Final action.
The Planning Board's final action shall consist of either:
A determination that the proposed project meets the criteria of
Subsection F for site plan approval, stating the specific manner
and criteria in which the proposed project conforms to this
chapter;
(a)
A written denial of the application stating the reasons by which
the submitted application and site plan are incomplete for
sufficient review by the Planning Board and/or its agents; or
(b)
Approval subject to any conditions, modifications and
restrictions as the Planning Board may deem necessary.
(c)
(1)
The Planning Board's decision shall be sent by certified mail to
the applicant and shall be filed with the Town Clerk within seven
days of the date of the final determination by the Planning Board
pertaining to any such plan approval. A copy shall also be sent to
the Building Inspector/Zoning Enforcement Officer.

G.
Enforcement.
Security for incomplete work. The Planning Board may require
the posting of a performance guaranty, in the form of a deposit
of money made out to the Town of Belchertown or a bond, in
an amount determined by the Planning Board to be sufficient to
cover the costs of all or any part of the improvements required
per the approved site plan and outstanding conditions affecting
(1)
H.
§ 145-27 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-27
139:226
public facilities, such as roads or drainage, or public health, safety
or general welfare. The Planning Board, through the action of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, may suspend any license or permit
when work is not performed as required. The security or guaranty
is to ensure that the incomplete work is completed within a
reasonable time. The Planning Board shall establish a deadline
for completion of not more than one year from the posting of the
security. This allowance is subject to the review by the Planning
Board by a site inspection to ensure the safety and health for those
who occupy the structure and use the site. If the Planning Board
requires a performance guaranty, the guaranty must be posted
before the site plan may be approved.
Each site plan must include a total construction estimate with an
inflation factor added to it. Security is to be provided to cover
all work involving public property, all drainage and stormwater
structures, and additional amounts to cover any health and safety
hazards resulting from incomplete work on the site.
The Planning Board must sign a certificate of completion for any
security or guaranty to be released.
Certificate of occupancy. No occupancy permit shall be issued for
any building or structure, or portion thereof, until the Building
Inspector receives certification from a registered architect,
landscape architect, engineer or land surveyor, that all
construction (including utilities) has been done in accordance with
the approved site plan (not required for site plans for structures
less than 5,000 square feet). The Building Inspector may issue a
conditional certificate of occupancy to allow a tenant to operate
before full site completion, but this is issued at the tenant's and
property owner's risk of rescission in the event that the site work
is incomplete by the required date. The Building Inspector and
Planning Board shall require a performance guaranty to cover any
unfinished site items shown on the approved site plan during the
conditional occupancy.
(2)
Modification of an approved site plan.
In the event that the applicant desires to alter, modify or correct an
approved site plan, the applicant shall provide the Planning Board
with:
A written statement, signed by the applicant and property
owner, requesting such changes;
(a)
Seven prints of the original approved site plan with the
changes drawn on said plan in red; and
(b)
Other documentation deemed necessary by the Board for its
review of the proposed modification.

Purpose and intent. This bylaw is to promote safe, effective and efficient
use of small wind energy systems for individual property owners to
reduce on-site consumption of utility-supplied electricity, while avoiding
undue negative effects on surrounding properties.
A.
Applicability.
Small wind energy systems, as defined herein, shall be allowed by
special permit issued in accordance with this bylaw in all zoning
districts in the Town.
(1)
The Planning Board is the special permit granting authority for
small wind energy systems.
(2)
This section applies to small wind systems no greater than 100
kilowatts of rated nameplate capacity proposed to be constructed
after the effective date of this section.
(3)
(4) Towers are limited to one tower per parcel.
Small wind energy systems mounted on buildings shall extend or
protrude no more than five feet higher than the highest point of the
building.
(5)
Small wind energy systems that are used primarily for agriculture,
as defined in § 145-2 of this chapter, also pursuant to MGL c. 40A,
§ 3, are exempt from this bylaw.
(6)
B.
Definitions.
HEIGHT  The height of a wind turbine measured from natural grade
to the tip of the rotor blade at its highest point, or blade-tip height.
This measure is also commonly referred to as the maximum tip height
(MTH).
OFF-GRID  A standalone generating system not connected to or in any
way dependent on the public utility grid.
RATED NAMEPLATE CAPACITY  The maximum rated output of
electric power specified by an equipment manufacturer on the
nameplate of a piece of equipment or wind turbine system.
C.
§ 145-28 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-28.1
139:234
SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM  A wind energy conversion system
consisting of a wind turbine and associated control or conversion
electronics that has a rated capacity of not more than 100 kW and
which is intended to provide power primarily for on-site uses, although
excess generation may be supplied to the commercial power grid. The
distinction between this small wind energy system and a commercial
system is that this is intended to provide an alternative to the public
utility grid, whereas a commercial system is intended to provide to the
public utility grid for pay.
TOWER  A freestanding structure on which the wind turbine is
mounted.
WIND MONITORING OR METEOROLOGICAL TOWER  A temporary
tower used to gather wind data necessary for site evaluation and
development of a wind energy project. In addition, a meteorological
tower may be equipped to record temperature, solar radiation and air
pressure if necessary, but is not used for the purpose of generating
electricity.
WIND TURBINE  A device that converts kinetic wind energy into
rotational energy that drives an electrical generator. A wind turbine
typically consists of a tower, nacelle body, and a rotor with two or more
blades.

21; amended 5-14-2018 ATM by Art. 22]
Restoration shall be carried on simultaneously with excavation
so that, for excavation only, when any three-acre operation
area has been excavated, at least two of those acres must be
restored before work commences on the next two contiguous
acres; and for excavation with processing, when any six
operation acres have been excavated at least five of those
acres must be restored before work commences on the next

distance to one foot of vertical distance (4:1). The Planning
Board may modify the required slope where the stability of
material, or ledge rock, makes steeper slopes practical.
[Amended 5-13-2002 ATM by Art. 23]
(c)
Unless the permit conditions expressly require alteration of
drainage patterns, the land shall be left so that natural storm
drainage shall leave the property at the original natural

§ 145-29 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-29.1
139:244
General objectives. The provision of accessory apartments is intended
to:
Provide housing options for residents who cannot afford, or who do
not desire, a single-unit house with land, for example, young adults
and senior citizens; and
(1)
Provide older owners with a means of obtaining rental income,
companionship, security and services, and thereby enable them to
stay more comfortably in houses and neighborhoods they might
otherwise be forced to leave;
(2)
Encourage a more economic and energy-efficient use of the Town's
housing supply while maintaining the appearance and character of
the Town's residential neighborhoods;
(3)
Protect the stability, property values, and the single-unit residential
character of a neighborhood by ensuring that accessory
apartments are installed only on owner-occupied lots and are
properly permitted and inspected;
(4)
Add moderately priced rental units to the housing stock to meet the
needs of smaller households and make housing units available to
moderate-income households who might otherwise have difficulty
finding housing;
(5)
(6) To provide housing units for persons with disabilities.
A.
Procedure. The Planning Board may issue a special permit for one
apartment accessory to the use of a single-unit dwelling, provided each
of the following conditions is met:
There shall be no more than one accessory apartment on an
individual parcel of land, regardless of the parcel's area.
(1)
The owner of the residence in which the accessory unit is created
must continue to occupy at least one of the dwelling units as his
or her primary residence. The special permit for the accessory
apartment may be revoked by the Planning Board if the owner no
longer occupies one of the dwelling units.
(2)
Up to 33% of the gross floor area of the main dwelling, not to
exceed 600 square feet maximum gross floor area, may be
permitted for the accessory apartment; to provide for development
of housing units for disabled individuals, the Planning Board may
allow reasonable deviation from the stated conditions when
necessary to install features that facilitate access and mobility for
disabled persons.
(3)
(4) The accessory apartment shall have only one bedroom.
There is no outward evidence that the premises are being used for
more than one residential unit. That is:
(5)
B.
§ 145-29.1 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-29.1
139:245
All stairways to apartments should be enclosed within the
exterior walls of the dwelling. Otherwise, they must not be
apparent from the street.
(a)
Any new entrance shall be located on the side or in the rear of
the dwelling or accessory building.
(b)
Where there are two or more existing entrances on the front
facade of a dwelling, if modifications are made to any entrance,
the result shall be that one entrance appears more prominent
than the others.
(c)
The accessory apartment must use the same driveway as the
main dwelling unit.
(d)
The accessory apartment must have the same street address as the
main dwelling unit, but with the designation "A" for the apartment,
for example, if the house is No. 123, the accessory apartment would
be No. 123A.
(6)
Accessory apartments are allowed only in the AG-A, AG-B, LR, and
VR Zones, and only with a special permit from the Planning Board.
(7)
Special permits issued under this section shall specify that the
owner must occupy one of the dwelling units. Prior to the
occupancy of the accessory apartment, the special permit must
be recorded in the Hampshire Registry of Deeds or Land Court,
as appropriate, in the chain of title to the property, with
documentation of the recording provided to the Building Inspector/
Zoning Enforcement Officer. This special permit requires the
applicant to demonstrate to the special permit granting authority
that § 145-69 is satisfied.
(8)
When there is a transfer of ownership of a property with a
permitted accessory apartment, the new owner may apply for
transfer of the accessory apartment special permit by submitting
a notarized letter of application stating that the new owner shall
occupy one of the dwelling units on the premises. In extenuating
circumstances of transfer, such as, but not limited to, inheritance,
bankruptcy, or foreclosure, the owner may request the Planning
Board modify the owner-occupancy requirement to allow
reasonable time to establish occupancy. The period of owner nonresidency
will not exceed one year. During the nonresidency
period, the owner shall not be allowed to rent both units.
(9)
Prior to issuance of an accessory apartment special permit, a floor
plan must be submitted showing the building, including proposed
interior and exterior changes to the building.
(10)
The applicant must demonstrate in writing that the special permit
requirements of § 145-69, with specific emphasis on Subsection
A(1)(a),(b), (c), have been met.
(11)
§ 145-29.1 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-29.1
139:246
Apartments created before the adoption of this bylaw. To ensure that
accessory apartments in existence before the adoption of this bylaw
comply with the Massachusetts building code:
Apartments that lawfully existed before the adoption of this bylaw,
but do not strictly conform to the terms of this by law, are exempt
from the terms of this bylaw for the life of the current special
permit.
(1)
The Planning Board may authorize, under a special permit and in
conjunction with the building inspector, an accessory apartment
in an owner-occupied single-unit dwelling. The Board shall review
each existing apartment on its individual merits to determine if
the dwelling conforms to the Massachusetts Building Code. The
applicant must follow the same procedure described in this bylaw,
including the submission of a notarized letter declaring owneroccupancy.
(2)
If an accessory apartment special permit expires, a new application
for a special permit is required and shall conform to the bylaw as
exists at the time of new application.
(3)
The Planning Board may authorize a special permit for an
apartment that existed prior to May 12, 2014, which may or may
not conform to this standard, upon a finding that it is the best
interests of the community to recognize the current use.
(4)
C.
Accessory apartment in accessory structure. Consistent with the
definition of accessory structure in § 145-2 of this bylaw, the Planning
Board may grant a special permit to allow the construction of an
accessory apartment in an existing accessory structure which is on the
same lot as an existing single-unit dwelling provided:
The lot has an area of at least 20,000 square feet in the VR District
and at least 40,000 square feet in the AG-A, AG-B, and LR Districts;
(1)
The setbacks of the accessory structure meet the setback
requirements of a primary dwelling in the subject zone;
(2)
The accessory structure is no more than 75 feet from the primary
dwelling with clear line of sight between the primary dwelling and
the accessory structure;
(3)
(4) (Reserved)
The accessory apartment has not more than 600 square feet of
gross floor area; to provide for development of housing units for
disabled individuals, the Planning Board may allow reasonable
deviation from the stated conditions when necessary to install
features that facilitate access and mobility for disabled persons.
The gross floor area for the accessory apartment shall not include
floor area used for any other permitted accessory use or floor area

designed, intended, or used for required off-street parking to serve
the principal dwelling;
Not more than one accessory structure on the lot may have a
accessory apartment. There shall be not more than two dwelling
units, one of which is the accessory apartment and the other is the
principal dwelling, on the lot;
(6)
The accessory apartment complies with all applicable building,
health, and safety codes for a dwelling; and
(7)
The exterior appearance of the accessory structure maintains the
essential character of the purpose for which it was originally
constructed, which must be for something other than an accessory
apartment, and is visually compatible with the principal dwelling
unit on the same lot and with the character of the neighborhood.
(8)

Common Drive Development
[Amended 5-13-1996 ATM by Art. 23; 5-12-2003 ATM by Art. 27;
12-5-2005 STM by Art. 10]
§ 145-42. Definitions; intent.
§ 145-43. Special permit granting authority; waivers.
A. Definitions. Refer to § 145-2 of this chapter.
Intent. This article is meant to allow for a minor residential
development alternative to conventional subdivision development. The
purpose of a common drive development is to result in less
environmental damage than a conventional subdivision or separate
curb cuts for each lot would cause.
B.
Minor common drive. A minor drive that serves only two lots and is
less than 600 feet long may be approved by the Department of Public
Works upon submittal of an owners' maintenance agreement, a plan
showing the right-of-way, and a grade and stormwater plan meeting the
standards of the town's curb-cut bylaw, and does not require a special
permit. The owners' maintenance agreement and right-of-way must be
recorded with the deeds of each property.
C.
Special permit common driveway. A two-lot drive longer than 600 feet,
and any common drive serving up to six lots, is subject to a common
drive development special permit from the Planning Board under this
article.
D.
The Belchertown Planning Board shall be the special permit granting
authority for all purposes under this article and shall adopt rules and
regulations with respect to the administration of applications or special
permits under this article, subject to the conditions set forth below and
in accordance with the provisions of § 145-69 of this chapter and MGL
c. 40A, §§ 9 and 11, as amended.
A.
Waiver of compliance. The Belchertown Planning Board, acting as the
special permit granting authority under this article, in appropriate
cases, may waive strict compliance with such requirements of this
article as provided in MGL c. 40A, § 9, where such action is in the
public interest and not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the
Zoning Act or this chapter. The applicant shall submit waiver requests
in writing. Waivers granted by the Planning Board under this subsection
may be limited by conditions which shall be endorsed on the plan
to which said conditions relate or set forth in a separate instrument
attached to the plan.
B.
§ 145-42 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-44
139:263
§ 145-44. Standards.
The driveway of a common drive development shall be constructed to
minimum standards as described in this article. The following regulations
shall apply to a common drive development:
The common drive:
Shall not be extended and shall not be an extension of an existing
common drive;
(1)
Shall not be connected to any other way except the way from which
it originates;
(2)
Shall serve no more than six lots. A common drive longer than
600 feet shall serve no more than three lots. For purposes of this
paragraph, the length of the common drive shall be measured from
its intersection with the public way from which it originates to the
most distant point serving more than one lot; and
(3)
Shall enter from the same public way which serves as frontage
for the lots in the common drive development, unless unique
circumstances are such that the Planning Board may permit access
from a public way not fronting every lot in the common drive
development.
(4)
A.
A lot may be served by the common drive only if the ownership of
that lot provides mandatory membership in an owners' association
responsible for annual and long-term maintenance, including, but not
limited to, removal of ice and snow from the common drive. See
§ 145-45B(14).23
B.
A common drive development shall only be allowed for single-dwelling
or duplex residential use.
C.
Each lot shall have legal frontage on a public way meeting the
requirements of the zoning bylaw in effect with regard to the district
in which the lot is located at the time of the application. All other
dimensional requirements, as defined in § 145-16 of the Zoning Bylaw,
for lots served by a common driveway, including but not limited to lot
area, coverage, width, and setback of front, side and rear yards, as
measured in relation to the street serving as the legal frontage for the
lots, shall be the same as would be required for those lots had they
not shared a common driveway. A lot in more than one zone shall be
governed by the requirements for the zone in which the majority (more
than 50%) of the lot is located.
D.
Each lot shall front on the common drive right-of-way for a minimum
distance of twenty feet or for such distance as the Planning Board
E.

§ 145-44 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-44
139:264
§ 145-45. Administration.
deems necessary to provide adequate access to the interior of the lot
from said right-of-way.
In accordance with § 145-69A(1) and § 145-42B, the Planning Board
may issue a special permit for a common drive development if the
applicant demonstrates to the Planning Board that the construction of
the common drive will:
Cause less environmental damage to the lots, specifically to
wetland resource areas and slopes, than either separate driveways
or a subdivision, while allowing vehicular access to each lot; and
(1)
Preserve or enhance the prevalent character of the area by
reducing curb cuts that would be otherwise allowed and by
maintaining extant vegetation and topography.
(2)
F.
Special permit granting authority. After notice and public hearing in
accordance with Section 9 of the Zoning Act (MGL c. 40A, § 9), the
Planning Board may, after due consideration of the reports and
recommendations of the Conservation Commission, Director of Public
Works, and Town Engineer, grant such a special permit, provided that
the conditions in § 145-44 and the requirements of § 145-45A and
§ 145-45B have been met.
A.
Requirements. The application for a special permit pursuant to this
article shall be accompanied by a site plan showing all of the applicable
information stipulated in this article. At the discretion of the Planning
Board, an environmental analysis may be required. The common drive
development shall comply with applicable stormwater runoff control
standards established by the Mass. Department of Environmental
Protection, or US Environmental Protection Agency. Drainage shall be
designed and constructed to contain stormwater runoff on the premises
or in a manner that will not have a detrimental effect on other
properties.
B.
Common drive developments shall conform to the following design
standards:
Width. [Amended 5-8-2017 ATM by Art. 24]
Item

Width of gravel base 182
Width of finished surface 143
(1)
C.
§ 145-44 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-45
139:265
NOTES:
1The center line of the common drive shall coincide with the center
line of the common drive right-of-way, unless otherwise approved
by the Planning Board.
2The minimum width of the common drive (gravel base) shall be
18 feet, except that where the common drive serves no more than
two lots the width may be reduced to 12 feet.
3A gravel surface may be allowed if the common drive serves no
more than two lots and/or complies with Subsection C(7)(b).
Grades. Maximum grade is 10% to allow for safe winter passage.
Minimum grade is 1/2% to provide adequate drainage and avoid
pooling of water.
(2)
Horizontal alignment. Horizontal alignment should minimize
alteration of the land by avoiding steep slopes, ledge, and other
natural features. Common drives serving three or more houses
shall have adequate safety precautions for any sharp curves. Curve
radii must be great enough to accommodate delivery vehicles and
fire trucks.
(3)
Intersections.
The common drive shall be laid out to intersect with the street
as nearly as possible to a right angle. In no case shall street
and way intersections be less than 75°.
(a)
Intersection approaches shall have a slope of less than 2% for
at least 50 feet measured from the edge of the pavement of the
intersecting road.
(b)
(4)
Easements. Easements for utilities and drainage that cannot be
contained in the common drive right-of-way shall be provided
where necessary and shall be at least 20 feet wide. Wider
easements may be required by the Board if necessary.
(5)
Site and earthwork. Development shall be designed and
constructed for as little disturbance as possible to the natural
landform. Development shall demonstrate appropriate terrainadaptive
design and construction techniques. Extensive grading
shall be avoided. Alternate site design and construction measures
are encouraged to mitigate the effects of development on steep
slopes.
Natural and cultural features. All natural and cultural features,
such as large trees, watercourses, stone walls, scenic points,
historic spots, and similar community assets, shall be
preserved.
(a)
(6)
§ 145-45 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-45
139:266
Setting lines and grades. The applicant shall employ a
professional engineer or registered land surveyor to set all
lines and grades in a manner satisfactory to the Planning
Board, Director of Public Works and the Town Engineer.
(b)
Clearing the right-of-way. The area for six feet from the gravel
base shall be cleared and grubbed of all stumps, brush, roots,
and like material. The Planning Board may require a greater
cleared area to accommodate drainage, to improve sight
distances, and to accomplish other public purposes. The
Planning Board will determine this upon advice from the
Director of Public Works, the Conservation Commission, Town
Engineer, or other consulting authority.
(c)
Erosion control and bank stabilization during construction.
All cleared and excavated land must be secured to prevent
erosion. An explanation of proposed erosion controls must be
submitted as part of the plan and must satisfy the Planning
Board, the Director of Public Works, the Town Engineer, and
the Conservation Commission.
(d)
Unsuitable material. All unsuitable material for road
construction, such as peat, topsoil, and highly organic silt or
clay, or any other material that, in the opinion of the Director of
Public Works, is considered to be detrimental to the subgrade,
shall be removed and replaced with suitable gravel.
(e)
Subgrade. The subgrade shall be shaped to a true surface
conforming to the lines and grades indicated in the approved
plan (cross section and profile) and, where original ground,
shall be compacted to a depth of six inches. A tolerance of
1/2 inch above or below finished subgrade will be permitted,
provided that this difference is not maintained over 50 feet and
the required crown (cross slope) is maintained.
(f)
Cutting and filling; limitations on cut and fill. The depth of any
cut area or the height of any fill, as measured from natural
grade shall not be greater than seven feet. The total combined
depth of any cut area or height of any fill as a result of
driveway grading or any subsequent grading shall not total
more than seven feet, as measured from natural grade. Any
cuts and fills for the common drive development must be
quantified in the plan.
(g)
Fill areas. In fill areas, the embankment shall be ordinary
borrow.
(h)
Removal of earth from the site. The removal of earth from
the subdivision site is regulated by the Town of Belchertown
Zoning Bylaw, Chapter 145, Zoning, of the Code of the Town of
Belchertown, § 145-29. Site construction is to conform closely
to the natural features. As a result, there should be a minimal
(i)
§ 145-45 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-45
139:267
amount of earth to be removed. If the developer seeks to
remove gravel, sand, or other earth beyond the amount
necessary to construct the driveway according to the plan, the
developer must apply for a special permit for earth removal.
Pavement structure.
The common drive surface may have a gravel finish if its
slope is between the permitted minimum and 8%, inclusive,
except where it is the opinion of the Planning Board that the
terrain and design results in water being carried along the
drive surface (rather than sheeting off at right angles to it), in
which case the surface shall be sealed or paved as the Planning
Board requires. The drive may have a sealed surface for grades
up to 8%, inclusive, except where soil and potential erosion
conditions are such that it is the opinion of the Planning Board
that a heavier-wear surface is needed. Grades over 8% and
others as required by the Planning Board shall be paved.
(a)
Gravel finish shall be at least four inches thick, compacted
measure. It shall be of a composition suitable, in the opinion
of the Planning Board, for the actual drainage conditions and
shall contain no stones larger than 1 1/2 inches in size. Where
the subbase is firm, well-drained gravel, the Planning Board
may permit the substitution of a four-inch layer of finish gravel
for the upper four inches of the gravel base. In no event will the
total gravel thickness be less than 12 inches. If it is the opinion
of the Planning Board that a gravel surface or sealed surface is
inadequate due to soil and potential erosion conditions, then a
heavier-wear surface will be required.
(b)
A common drive that is to be sealed shall be scraped and
shaped and the gravel base upgraded as required by the
Planning Board and Director of Public Works. The sealed
surface shall consist of a layer of three-eighths-inch stone, two
penetration coats of oil at 1/2 gallon per square yard and one
sealer coat at 1/3 gallon per square yard.
(c)
(7)
Monuments and markers. Monuments shall be installed along the
right-of-way at critical points as shown in the plan where, as
determined by the Planning Board upon recommendation from
the Director of Public Works or the Town Engineer, permanent
monuments are necessary for certain location of the right-of-way
boundary. Monuments shall be installed under the direction of a
Massachusetts registered land surveyor.
(8)
Drainage. The drainage design shall consist of an open drainage
system consisting of grassed swales and waterways or overland
sheet flow, if appropriate, or a closed drainage system meeting
Mass. DEP stormwater standards. Vegetation shall be retained to
assist in water absorption and soil retention. When vegetation
(9)
§ 145-45 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 145-45
139:268
must be cleared for construction, the soil must be revegetated
immediately with native species per approval by the conservation
commission. Outlets from the drainage swales should be properly
engineered and avoid damage to wetland resource areas.
Stormwater shall not be permitted to cross over the common drive.
Construction. Trees, brush, stumps, and other material in
objectionable amounts are to be disposed of so as not to
interfere with construction or proper functioning. The channel
section is to be free of bank projections or other irregularities,
which prevent normal flow. The waterway or outlet shall be
excavated or shaped to line, grade and cross section as
required to meet the criteria specified herein, free of bank
projections or the irregularities that will impede normal flow.
Earth removed and not needed in construction is to be spread
or disposed of so as not to interfere with the functioning of
the waterway. Fills are to be compacted as needed to prevent
unequal settlement that will cause damage in the completed
waterway.
(a)
Vegetation. Waterways and outlets shall be protected against
erosion by vegetation as soon after construction as is
practicable and before diversions or other channels are
directed into them. Consideration should be given to jute
matting, excelsior matting, or sodding of the channel to
provide erosion protection as soon after construction as
possible.
(b)
Maintenance. The common drive is established as private property.
Maintenance after formal completion is the responsibility of the
mandatory owners' association that must be created under
§ 145-44B. The Town shall not under any circumstances be held
liable for construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or snow
removal on any common drive.
(10)
(11)Name. Common drives shall not be given a name.
Signs. A permanent marker not to exceed six square feet, per
§ 145-22 of this chapter, shall be placed at the intersection of
the common drive and the public way. The sign or marker shall
include the designation "private way" as well as house numbers
off the public way. A similar marker shall be placed where the
common drive meets each individual lot. Should the common drive
split, a permanent marker must also be placed at each intersection
indicating which houses are located on either side of the split.
(12)
Restrictions. The site plan shall identify as such all land that is to
be held and administered by the mandatory owners' association.
It shall bear restrictions satisfactory to the Planning Board, to run
with the land, restricting the way shown to remain private property
and not to be extended, and any other restrictions and easements
(13)
§ 145-45 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-45
139:269
§ 145-46. Inspections.
§ 145-47. Acceptance as a public way.
A common drive designed and constructed in accordance with these
requirements is not a street which may be accepted as a public way. In
granting a special permit for a common drive, the Planning Board shall
impose a condition prohibiting the lot owners from petitioning for
acceptance of the common drive as a public way, unless the mandatory
owners' association presents a petition to the Town demonstrating that
the common drive conforms to Chapter 270, Subdivision of Land, of the
Code of the Town of Belchertown, for the construction and laying of ways,
including requirements pertaining to cul-de-sac or dead-end streets, and
that are required for common drive development by these rules. It
shall incorporate by reference the document(s), satisfactory to the
Planning Board, creating the mandatory owners' association and
setting forth restrictive covenants and easements binding present
and future owners of all the lots served by the common drive. Such
document(s) must include but are not limited to the following:
Specific standards for the maintenance of all structures
designed to the requirements of a common drive special
permit, including but not limited to the travel way, drainage
system and signage.
(a)
Provisions for allocating responsibility for snow removal and
for maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of the common
driveway, drainage system, and signage.
(b)
Text of proposed easements including the metes and bounds
description.
(c)
A procedure for the resolution of disagreements. Said
document(s) shall be recorded along with the site plan and
public utility and drainage easements in the Hampshire
Registry of Deeds and shall also be recited in and attached to
every deed to every lot served by the common drive.
(d)
Fees. Refer to the Planning Board fee schedule as kept by the Town
Clerk and Planning Board office. All engineering and legal review
costs by the Town's consulting engineer or legal counsel shall be
paid by the applicant.
(14)
The common drive shall be inspected prior to each construction step
by the Director of Public Works, the Town's consulting engineer, or by
other duly appointed representatives of the Planning Board.
A.
In lieu of Subsection A, the developer's engineer shall certify, in writing,
after each construction step that construction of the road is in
substantial accordance with the approved plan and typical cross
section.
B.

demonstrating that the lots served by the common drive, with structures
as built, conform with dimensional regulations (§ 145-16) applicable to the
zoning district with respect to lot area, frontage, coverage, setbacks and lot
width. A lot divided by the common drive right-of-way shall be considered
as two separate lots for purposes of this demonstration, with new lot lines
as created by the proposed new public way.
§ 145-48. Lapse of special permit.
A special permit granted under this article shall lapse after 24 months if
substantial construction has not begun by such date, except for good cause
shown and approved by the Planning Board.
§ 145-49. Submission of as-built plans.
Prior to any house served by the common drive receiving a certificate
of occupancy, a revised, recordable Mylar of the original submittal
showing the actual existing as-built conditions and six paper copies
shall be submitted to the Planning Board upon completion of the
common drive. A copy shall be submitted in a digital (electronic) format
consistent with the town's geographic information system, or GIS. The
applicant shall submit the digital copy on 3 1/2 inch diskettes, Iomega
zip disc, or CD-ROM. The electronic plan will be reviewed for its
content and ability to meet the Town's GIS standards. Failure to submit
these data in electronic format or to meet the standards below will
delay the Planning Board's endorsement of the certificate of completion
until acceptable digital plans are provided.
A.
Specific standards required include:
All digital mapping data must be delivered in a standard
geographic coordinate system. The coordinate system employed by
the town's GIS is Massachusetts Mainland Zone horizontal datum
of NAD83 (state plane units feet), and a vertical datum of NGVD88.
(1)
All digital data must be delivered in one of the following formats:
AutoCAD dwg format, AutoCAD dxf format, ArcView shapefile
format, or Arc/Info e00 format.
(2)
All data must be topologically clean, meaning that polygons are
closed and lines connect at nodes. Features that naturally connect
(i.e. driveways to roads, parcel lines to roads and water features,
etc.) must connect seamlessly. If the digital information provided is
tiled across multiple sheets, the abutting edges of each sheet must
precisely match along the join lines.
(3)
All digital line work must be developed as continuous lines and
rendered using line types/styles (i.e. dashed lines, etc). Continuous
lines that have been broken to appear dashed are not acceptable.
(4)
B.
§ 145-47 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-49
139:271
§ 145-50. Enforcement; appeals; violations and penalties.
All text in the AutoCAD files must appear on top of other features
and stored in separate layers. In the digital file, those features
under the text should not be erased in order to make text clearer.
(5)
All features must be thematically organized in the CADD or GIS
data structure. Having all features in a single CADD layer or GIS
file is not acceptable.
(6)
Documentation of the data format must be provided and a complete
list of all layer names with descriptions. If multiple files are
delivered, each must be documented with a complete description
of its purpose. All documentation must be provided in Microsoft(?)
Word format or ASCII text format, and shall be included on the
electronic media containing the electronic plan data.
Documentation must be provided on the method used to gather the
data, an estimation of the horizontal and vertical accuracy, and the
date of data capture.
(7)
The Building Inspector shall not issue a building permit for a lot in
a common drive development until the necessary special permit is
granted and recorded and the appeal period has expired.
A.
The Building Inspector shall not issue a certificate of occupancy permit
until all work has been completed as approved and the as-built plan has
been submitted in corrected form in accordance with § 145-49.
B.
Decisions of the Planning Board regarding special permit approval may
be appealed as set forth in the Zoning Act, MGL c. 40A, as amended.
C.
Violations of the approved special permit for a common drive or any
conditions of approval shall be subject to the provisions of § 145-67 of
this chapter, as amended.
D.

adopted by the Planning Board under MGL c. 41, § 81Q as of May 20, 2001,
or as may have been amended or adopted as of the date of the submission
of the application for OSCD definitive subdivision approval.
OPEN SPACE  Property within a subdivision designated to be deeded
by the developer to the Town or other approved organization or to be
maintained by the developer or owner in an undeveloped state in a manner
approved by the Planning Board. Such open space is to be used for passive
or active recreation, agriculture, forestry, preservation of ecologically
significant landscapes, wildlife habitat, natural or scenic vistas, unique
natural or cultural features, or greenways. Such open space shall be
retained in substantially a natural, wild or open condition or in a landscaped
condition in such a manner as to allow to a significant extent the
preservation of wildlife or other natural resources. Open space shall not
include areas designated for sediment control, erosion control, or
stormwater control; such areas are considered part of the subdivision
infrastructure and are not intended for recreation, agriculture, or forestry.
Open space shall include no more than 15% of wetlands, surface waters,
floodplains, or areas with unaltered slopes greater than 25% provided,
however, that the Planning Board may allow the applicant to include a
greater percentage of wetlands, surface waters, floodplains, or areas with
unaltered slopes greater than 25% in such open space upon a
demonstration that such inclusion promotes the purposes of this bylaw.
YIELD PLAN  A conceptual plan showing how the parcel could be
subdivided in a conventional manner. Determination of the possible number
of conventional lots shall be determined by Title V regulations, 310 CMR

purposes of determining the number of OSCD dwelling units, each
conceptual conventional lot must meet the requirements of a buildable lot
for a single-family, or two-family, dwelling unit as defined in the zoning
district in which the OSCD is located and meet all other applicable
requirements of the Zoning Bylaw and Subdivision Regulations. In no case
shall the number of OSCD dwelling units exceed the number of units that
would be allowed under a conventional subdivision.
§ 145-54. OSCD development.
Permitted uses and standards.
A detached single-unit dwelling, an attached single-unit dwelling,
or a detached double-unit dwelling, any with an accessory building,
may be constructed on certain lots in an OSCD development
although such lots have less area, frontage and front, rear and side
yard dimensions than required for standard single- and double-unit
lots.
(1)
The open space community development dimensional standards as
specified in § 145-55 of this chapter shall be met.
(2)
The Planning Board may allow no more than 20% of the total
number of principal structures to be double-unit dwellings. These
units shall be designated on the plan and in restrictions in the
deeds of each separate property.
(3)
The development tract for which an OSCD development is
proposed shall be in single ownership or control at the time of
application and shall not be less than the minimum size as specified
in § 145-55 of this chapter.
(4)
An OSCD development shall only be permitted on a tract of land
which has access to and will be connected to a public sewer or
where the percolation rates for the areas in which the on-site
subsurface sewage disposal systems are to be located meet state
Environmental Code (Title V, 310 CMR 15.211) and Belchertown
Board of Health requirements.
(5)
In determining the allowed number of lots, fractions over 1/2 may
be increased to the nearest whole unit, and fractions under 1/2
shall be decreased to the nearest whole unit.
(6)
A.
Density. The maximum number of dwelling units for an OSCD shall
be determined by use of a yield plan, which is a conceptual plan
showing how the parcel could be subdivided in a conventional manner.
Determination of the possible number of conventional lots shall be
determined by Title V regulations, 310 CMR 15.000, as well as the
Belchertown Board of Health regulations. In no case shall the number
of OSCD dwelling units exceed the number of units that would be
allowed under a conventional subdivision. There shall be no further
subdivision of an approved OSCD.
B.
§ 145-53 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-54
139:275
For any tract with access to public sewers, the minimum lot size
for an OSCD development shall be 15,000 square feet per lot. The
Planning Board may waive this requirement when it serves the
purposes of this bylaw.

or soil absorption systems (310 CMR 15.211).
(b)
All OSCD developments must meet the minimum state
Environmental Code (Title V) requirements for nitrogen
loading limitations (310 CMR 15.214-15.217). For OSCDs with
individual lot sizes less than 40,000 square feet, applicants
must meet the following standards:
Applicants must designate, on a plan, specific areas as
"nitrogen credit land," based on the following equation:
(40,000 square feet x number of OSCD lots)  (total
square feet in proposed OSRD lots) = square feet of
required nitrogen credit land
Basic example: (40,000 x 15)  (15 x 30,000) = 150,000

ARTICLE XIV
Business Neighborhood Center District
[Added 5-8-2000 ATM by Art. 18; amended 5-11-2009 ATM by Art.
13; 12-1-2014 STM by Art. 5]
§ 145-72. Purpose.
The Business Neighborhood Center District is intended to result in a vibrant
diverse neighborhood that is integrated with and central to the whole
community. Its design is to provide aesthetic consistency with the
surrounding neighborhoods while contributing to the community's
economic vitality. It contains elements such as open space buffers, and lot
dimensions that vary from those permitted in other districts as noted in
Article V of this chapter. It is to include current development technologies
in the areas of energy efficiency, stormwater management, transportation
and building design and construction.
§ 145-73. Development method.
The purposes of the Business Neighborhood Center District are:
To provide flexibility for developers seeking to provide a community
environment of mixed uses that includes businesses, certain
residential opportunities and civic amenities;
(1)
(2) To increase options for a vital mix of land uses;
(3) To provide expeditious construction permitting;
To allow the relatively intensive use of land in an alternative
pattern of development while maintaining existing character and
by which the following benefits and objectives are likely to be
attained, as described in Subsection B.
(4)
A.
Benefits and objectives of the Business Neighborhood Center District:
Improved business, employment and residential opportunities in
Belchertown.
(1)
Economical and efficient street, utility and public facility
installation, construction and maintenance through creative
design.
(2)
(3) Provision of open and civic spaces.
(4) Efficient use of land in harmony with its natural features.
A cohesive sense of community character achieved through mixed
uses and design.
(5)
Continuation of Belchertown's leadership in implementing
improved energy and infrastructure technologies.
(6)
B.
§ 145-72 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 145-73
139:293
§ 145-74. Administration.
Site plan approval by the Planning Board is required for each
development in the Business Neighborhood Center.
A.
The parts of a development allowed under this article that are to
become part of the Town's infrastructure, such as roads, stormwater
management, utilities, parking and civic amenities, may be subject
to Chapter 270, Subdivision of Land, of the Code of the Town of
Belchertown and other municipal laws and regulations, to be
determined by the respective permitting authorities during reviews.
B.
To facilitate timely processing, promote better communication and
avoid misunderstanding, applicants are encouraged to submit
conceptual materials for informal review by the Planning Board prior to
formal application for site plan approval.
A.
Site plan approval submission requirements. Each Business
Neighborhood Center site plan approval application and plan shall
provide the following information:
The location and specific boundaries of the project parcel or
parcels.
(1)
Signatures of authorized representatives of each entity with
ownership interest and each applicant or applicants' agent involved
in the project.
(2)
Written approval from the appropriate governing body certifying
the potential to connect to a public sewage system and a public
water supply.
(3)
Copies of all proposed covenants, easements, agreements and
other restrictions the applicant proposes, in draft guideline form,
not in final legal form.

to assist in determining whether the project site plan meets the
objectives and standards as set forth in this article.
(6)
B.
Review and approval process.
The review, notice and public hearing process for site plan approval
in the Business Neighborhood Center District shall be conducted
in the same manner as a special permit. After notice and public
hearing in accordance with MGL c. 40A, § 9, as amended, the
Planning Board shall, after due consideration of the reports and
recommendations of the Conservation Commission, Board of
Health, Board of Selectmen, Director of Public Works, Town
Engineer, and any other reviewing authority, approve a site plan,

§ 145-75. Dimensional standards.
Lots and buildings in a Business Neighborhood Center shall meet
dimensional standards that are appropriate to establish the desired form,
mass, public space, and service needs of the sites, notwithstanding the
requirements of Article V of this chapter. Recommended standards to
establish a design basis are the following:
provided that the conditions and standards of this article have
been adequately met. The Planning Board may impose reasonable
conditions on its approval to ensure compliance with the conditions

aspect of a site plan under this article, other than the residential
percentage cap, may be waived by the Planning Board where such
action is not detrimental to the public good. In such cases, any
waiver on a site plan with approval from the Planning Board
supersedes the individual bylaw governing the waiver. If the
applicant requests a waiver, it is incumbent upon the applicant to
demonstrate how the proposed waiver is not detrimental to the
public good. The Planning Board reserves the right to request a
waiver when the Board deems it appropriate, even if the applicant
does not request a waiver.

that the affected mobile home park accommodation does not comply
with the State Sanitary Code or the Town of Belchertown Code or any
other applicable code, ordinance or state law regulating the conditions
of housing accommodations and if it determines that such lack of
compliance is due to the failure of the owner to provide normal and
adequate repairs and maintenance. The Board may refuse to make
a downward adjustment of maximum rent if it determines that the
tenant is more than 60 days in arrears in payment of rent, unless such
arrearage is due to a withholding of rent under the provisions of MGL c.

or ordinances which protect the health and safety of other mobile home

Board shall notify the landlord, if the petition was filed by the tenant,
or the tenant, if the petition was filed by the landlord, of the receipt
of such petition and of the right of either party to request a hearing,
in writing, within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice, or the
Board may schedule a hearing on its own initiative. If a hearing is

initiative of the Board, notice of the time and place of the hearing
shall be furnished to the landlord and tenant, and the hearing shall
be conducted before the Board. The Board may consolidate petitions
and actions taken under its own initiative relating to mobile home park
accommodations in the same mobile home park, and all such petitions
and actions may be considered in a single hearing.
General adjustment of maximum rent by regulation. On its own
initiative, the Board may make a general adjustment, by percentage or
otherwise, of the rental levels for mobile home park accommodations,
subject to such conditions, if any, as the Board shall determine. Prior
to making such adjustment, a public hearing shall be held before the
Board. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper having a general circulation in
the town and posted in the Town Hall, both not less than seven days
prior to such hearing. Likewise, the owner or a tenant may petition
the Board for a similar-type general adjustment, in which event the
foregoing procedures shall be utilized by the Board.
B.
Limitation of petition for individual adjustment. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this section, the Board may, without holding a
hearing, refuse to adjust the maximum rent for an individual mobile
home park accommodation and may dismiss any petition for adjustment
if a decision has been made with regard to the maximum rent for such
mobile home park accommodation within 12 months or if the Board
finds that the petition for adjustment is filed for purposes of harassment
or for other purpose not intended herein.
C.

conducted as adjudicatory hearings in accordance with the provisions
of MGL c. 30A, §§ 10, 11 and 12. Rules and procedure for the conduct
of said hearings shall be those rules and regulations outlined in 801

practical, the Board shall meet and determine whether to proceed on
such petition pursuant to the formal or informal rules as outlined in
801 CMR 1.00 et seq. or under other procedure and shall indicate its
determination as to which rules and procedures shall be followed in its
notice of agency action to affected parties and in the public notice of

§ 252-4. Authority.
This article is adopted pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31 and 310 CMR 15.00 et
seq.
§ 252-5. Purpose.
A properly functioning septic system is required for the protection of public
health. Correct installation, in addition to siting, design and maintenance,
is an important component of ensuring properly functioning subsurface
sewage disposal systems. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that
septic system installers permitted by the Belchertown Board of Health are
knowledgeable regarding septic system construction, materials used and
governing state and local regulations. The purpose of these regulations is
also consistent with the requirements of 310 CMR 15.019, which provides
that the local approving authority shall issue disposal system installer's
permits only to those persons who have demonstrated capacity or
knowledge of the proper construction and installation of septic systems.
§ 252-6. References; written exam; disposal works installer's
permit.
Any person or business wishing to obtain or renew a disposal works
installer's permit from the Town of Belchertown shall submit two
references to the Board of Health or its agents. These references
shall be in written form, prepared by area health officials or system
designing professionals (no more than one reference from a designing
professional) and contain a statement that the bearer has satisfactory
knowledge and at least two years' experience or the equivalent in
the field of septic installation. An installer's permit issued by another
municipality in Massachusetts shall be acceptable as one of the
required references. This subsection may be waived by the Board of
Health for a permitted installer wishing to renew a permit who has
previously submitted valid references to the Board.
A.
In addition to presenting the above-required references, any person
or, in the circumstance of businesses with a number of employees, the
foreman or other on-site supervisor engaged in installing septic systems
within the Town of Belchertown shall take and pass with a grade of 75%
a written exam prepared and administered by the Belchertown Board
of Health or its agents. Re-examination is possible at the next available
test date, should a passing grade not be achieved at first or subsequent
sitting. Alternative testing methods will be made available to those
applicants with special needs. This subsection may be waived by the
Board of Health for a permitted installer wishing to renew a permit

§ 252-8. Severability.
If any portion, sentence or word of these regulations is declared invalid for
any reason whatsoever by a court of competent jurisdiction, that decision
shall not affect any other portion of these regulations, which shall remain in
full force and effective. To that end, these regulations are hereby declared
severable.
and who has previously taken and passed the written examination
administered by the Board of Health.
As required by Title V of the State Environmental Code, no person or
firm shall engage in construction, alteration, installation or repair of
an individual sewage disposal system without first obtaining a disposal
works installer's permit from the Belchertown Board of Health. The
permit shall expire on December 31 of the year in which it was issued,
unless otherwise revoked for cause or renewed by the Board of Health.
The fee for the permit is established annually by the Board of Health in
its schedule of fees.
C.
For violations of any of the requirements of these regulations, the Board
of Health may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the disposal
works installer's permit after the Board of Health has provided the
permit holder with the opportunity for a hearing on the matter. The
Board of Health shall notify the permit holder, in writing, stating the
reasons for which the permit is subject to suspension or revocation and
providing the date and time of the hearing.
A.
In addition to suspension or revocation, the Board of Health may
enforce the provisions of these regulations through civil or criminal
court action or noncriminal disposition pursuant to MGL c. 40, § 21D
and Chapter 1, General Provisions, § 1-2, Noncriminal Disposition, of
the Code of the Town of Belchertown, approved at the Special Town
Meeting of March 20, 1995, with the following penalties:
First offense: fine of $25 in addition to obtaining the required
permit.

Materials which exert or cause unusual volume of flow or
concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined herein.
(11)
Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable
to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements
of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters, or which are in violation of any requirement of a
permit issued under these rules and regulations.
(12)
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely,
in the opinion of the Board of Selectmen, that such wastes can harm
either the sewers, sewage treatment process or equipment, have an

Chapter 261
SMOKING AND ACCESS TO TOBACCO
§ 261-1. Findings; purpose; authority.
The Belchertown Board of Health does hereby find that:
The Environmental Protection Agency (Respiratory Health Effects
of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders, 1993) has
designated environmental tobacco smoke as a Class A carcinogen,
for which there are no known safe levels of exposure. Conclusive
evidence exists that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer, heart
disease, negative birth outcomes, respiratory infection, decreased
respiratory function, broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm,
allergies and irritations to the eyes, nose and throat of both the
smoker and nonsmoker exposed to secondhand smoke.
(1)
Smoke from cigarettes contains more than 4,700 chemical
compounds, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzine and
arsenic. Forty-three of these compounds are known cancer-causing
agents, and 400 are toxins. Secondhand smoke causes the death of
53,000 nonsmoking Americans each year (California Healthy Cities
Project, 1992). Restaurant and bar employees inhale the benzo(a)
pyrene equivalent of actively smoking 1 1/2 to 2 packs of cigarettes
per day. In California, waitresses have the highest mortality of
any female occupational group. Employees in restaurants and bars
have about a fifty-percent to ninety-percent increased risk of lung
cancer that is most likely attributable to tobacco smoke exposure
(Smoking and Restaurants: A Guide for Policymakers, Michael
Siegel, M.D. 1992).
(2)
A.
Accordingly, the Board of Health finds and declares that one purpose of
this regulation is to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting
smoking in public places.
B.
Further, the Board of Health finds smoking and other tobacco use
by minors to be a continuing problem with grave public health
consequences. More than 90% of all smokers begin smoking before age
18, and more than 3,000 young people begin to smoke every day in this
nation (Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: A Report of the
Surgeon General, Atlanta, Georgia, United States Department of Health
and Human Services, 1994). The average age at which Massachusetts
youth are beginning to smoke is age 10. In recognition of the Surgeon
General's conclusion that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin,
action is needed to curtail the easy access of minors to cigarettes and
other tobacco products. Therefore, a second purpose of this regulation
is to implement a strict and enforceable system to prevent the illegal
sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to minors.
C.

The purpose for submitting a preliminary plan of a subdivision is to enable
the subdivider, Planning Board and other municipal agencies and owners
of property abutting the proposed subdivision to discuss and clarify the
problems of such a subdivision before a definitive plan is proposed.
Therefore, it is strongly recommended that a preliminary plan be filed in
every case. Nonresidential subdivision requires a preliminary plan. The
Planning Board will distribute the plan to the various municipal agencies

be accomplished by delivery at any Planning Board meeting, delivery
to the Town Planner, or by registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed
to the Belchertown Planning Board, and in any case by giving written
notice to the Town Clerk by delivery or by registered mail, postage
prepaid, that such plan has been submitted. If notice is given by
delivery, the Town Clerk shall, if requested, give a written receipt
thereof.
C.
When multiple sheets are necessary, match lines shall be used with
an index plan graphically indicating the arrangement of standard (24
inches by 36 inches) sheets at a suitable scale.
D.
At the time of submission, a fee, in accordance with the Fee Schedule
(see § 270-67), shall be paid by the applicant to cover the cost of
handling and reviews. All review and advertising costs shall be paid by

reasons for its disapproval.
C.
The Planning Board shall file a certificate of action with the Town Clerk
and shall send notice of its action by certified mail to the applicant.

The Planning Board will review comprehensive permit applications to
determine if the proposed project will constitute a subdivision.
to a preliminary plan, and the Register of Deeds may not record a
preliminary plan. Approval of a preliminary plan does not in any way
constitute such approval as to authorize the owner to proceed with the
construction of street or other work in the subdivision, nor guarantee
approval of any definitive plan application developed from a preliminary
plan.
After submission of a comprehensive permit application to the Board
of Appeals and receipt by the Planning Board, the application shall be
reviewed by the Board of Health, the Conservation Commission, the
Town Engineer and other municipal agencies as in § 270-18A.

§ 270-24. Wetlands protection.
In accordance with MGL c. 131, § 40, no person shall remove, fill, dredge,
or alter any bank, fresh water wetland, beach, dune, flat marsh, or swamp
bordering on any existing creek, river, stream, pond, lake, or any land
under said waters without first filing written notice of intention to perform
such work with the local Conservation Commission and state Department of
Environmental Protection, and receiving an order of conditions. Any work,
which includes building construction, removal of vegetation, grading, or
excavation, that occurs within 100 feet of a wetland resource area or within
200 feet of a perennial stream or river requires that an application be filed
with the local Conservation Commission for review. A permit is required
from the Conservation Commission for work in these regulated areas, under
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act and Regulations 310 CMR et
seq., and the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw.
§ 270-25. Adequacy of existing public ways.
Due regard will be given by the Planning Board for the provision of
adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe
and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the
adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation
of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and
other emergencies; for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning
bylaws; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage,
underground utility services, fire, police, and other similar municipal
equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where necessary in a
subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other
and with the public ways in Belchertown and, if applicable, adjoining towns,
and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions. The School Committee may
offer opinions regarding school bus access and safety. The Planning Board
may request, at the developer's expense, a traffic study, to be reviewed
by the Town Engineer, that will demonstrate the effects the proposed
subdivision may have on surrounding public ways. (See § 270-26.) When
the physical condition or width of a private or public way from which
a subdivision has its access is considered by the Planning Board to be
inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by a subdivision,
the Board may require the applicant to make physical improvements to and
within the public way, except for any state highway. The Planning Board
Failure of the Conservation Commission to report to the Planning Board
within 45 days after receipt of a definitive plan shall not exempt the
proposed plan from wetland regulations pursuant to MGL c. 131, § 40.
A.
All requirements of local, state, and federal agencies having jurisdiction
in wetland issues, such as the Belchertown Wetlands Protection Bylaw;
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's
regulations governing wetlands and waterways (MGL c. 91); the Water
Pollution Control Division's Water Quality Certification; the Executive
Office of Environmental Affairs' MEPA requirements; and the Army
Corps of Engineers, shall be satisfied.

may seek the opinions of the Town Engineer, Director of Public Works,
Fire Department, School Committee, owners of land abutting the public
way, and anyone else it deems appropriate to determine its requirements
for improvements to existing ways. Such improvements may include a
requirement to dedicate land abutting the subdivision frontage for the
purpose of widening the public way to a width as great as that required
within the subdivision. Any such dedication of land for the purpose of
widening the public way and any such work performed within such public
way shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having
jurisdiction over such way. Such improvements may also include physical
improvements to and within the public way to the same standards required
within the subdivision. All costs of any such widening or construction shall
be borne by the applicant.
§ 270-26. Traffic analysis.
For every subdivision the developer must provide a traffic analysis prepared
by a registered traffic engineer. This report must bear the traffic engineer's
stamp and detail the number of vehicle trips generated per day, and how
traffic will affect the surrounding road network. This analysis must conform
to all current ITE standards.
§ 270-27. Environmental analysis.
To ensure the protection of the general public against any possible
harm to natural resources or other significant components of
community welfare by development, an environmental analysis is
required for every proposed subdivision.
A.
The environmental analysis must be conducted by an interdisciplinary
team, to include at least a civil engineer, a landscape architect, and a
wetland scientist. Experts in other fields may also be part of the team.
B.
Matters of environmental concern may include, but are not limited
to, the destruction of wildlife corridors or habitat, potential damage
to water supply through percolation or runoff, erosion, alteration of
wetland capacities, damage to historical and archaeological sites, an
increase in traffic substantially reducing the level of service and safety
of existing public ways, or other matters the Planning Board may deem
necessary for more extensive analysis. The scope of the analysis must
identify the best approaches to minimize damage and must cover the
following issues:
A statement by a professional in the field of concern, such as a
hydrogeologist, wildlife biologist, archaeologist, traffic engineer, or
other qualified professional, as to material effects upon important
wildlife habitats, hydrological system, outstanding botanical
features, vehicular traffic on neighboring streets, and scenic or
historic environs.

proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If any part of an area
proposed to be developed is located within a Floodplain District established
under Chapter 145, Zoning, it shall be reviewed to assure that:
Analysis of groundwater and surface water quality and levels,
including estimated phosphate and nitrate loading on groundwater
and surface water from septic tanks, lawn fertilizer, toxic wastes,
storage of petroleum products, and other activities within the
subdivision. For all subdivisions located in whole or in part within
the Aquifer Protection District described in the Belchertown
Zoning Bylaw, this shall include analysis of open and closed
drainage system alternatives, examining effects upon the basic
water budget, and examining effects upon the speed of transport of
contaminants.

§ 270-29. Stormwater runoff control.
All subdivision designs must meet the following nine stormwater
management standards. When one or more of the standards cannot
be met, an applicant may demonstrate that an equivalent level of
environmental protection will be provided.
No new stormwater conveyances (e.g., outfalls) may discharge
untreated stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or
waters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
(1)
Stormwater management systems must be designed so that postdevelopment
peak discharge rates do not exceed pre-development
peak discharge rates.
(2)
Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized
through the use of infiltration measures to the maximum extent
practicable. The annual recharge from the post-development site
should approximate the annual recharge from the pre-development
or existing site conditions, based on soil types.
(3)
For new development, stormwater management systems must be
designed to remove 80% of the average annual load (postdevelopment
conditions) of total suspended solids. It is presumed
that this standard is met when:
Suitable nonstructural practices for source control and
pollution prevention are implemented;
(a)
Stormwater management best management practices (BMPs)
are of adequate size to capture the prescribed runoff volume;
and
(b)
Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed.
"To the extent practicable" means the applicant has made all
reasonable efforts to meet the standards, including evaluation
of alternative BMP designs and their locations.
(c)
(4)
Stormwater discharges from areas with higher potential pollutant
loads require the use of specific stormwater management BMPs.
The use of infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited.
(5)
Stormwater discharges to critical areas must use certain
stormwater management BMPs approved for critical areas. Critical
areas are outstanding resource waters (ORWs), shellfish beds,
swimming beaches, cold water fisheries, and recharge areas for
public water supplies.
(6)
Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the
stormwater management standards to the maximum extent
practicable. If it is not practicable to meet all of these standards,
new (retrofitted or expanded) stormwater management systems
must be designed to improve existing conditions.
(7)
A.
§ 270-29 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 270-29
270:408
Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented during
construction.
(8)
All stormwater management systems must have an operation and
maintenance plan to ensure that systems function as designed.
(9)
The subdivider shall furnish projections of the increase of stormwater
runoff created by the proposed development from the two-year, tenyear
and one-hundred-year frequency twenty-four-hour duration Type
III distribution storms, as computed in accordance with the current
edition of Technical Release No. 55, or Technical Release No. 20, Urban
Hydrology, Engineering Division, Natural Resource Conservation
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, January 1975, as
amended. If the drainage system includes hydrograph routing an
appropriate method such as Technical Release No. 55 or Technical
Release No. 20 shall be used. All storm drainage calculations must be
designed by a civil engineer licensed in Massachusetts. The following
data shall be submitted for review by the Town Engineer or the Board's
designated agent:
No increase in the peak flows from the storms referred to in
§§ 270-40 and 270-42 of these regulations shall be allowed unless
downstream increases are compatible with an overall floodplain
management system. The following items should be considered in
determining whether increased peak flows are compatible with an
overall floodplain management system:
(a) The timing of peak flows from subwatersheds;
(b) The increased direction of high flow rates;
(c) The stability of downstream channels; and
The distance downstream that the peak discharges are
increased.
(d)
(1)
Topographic contour maps showing pre- and post-developed
drainage area(s) tributary to all portions of the site.
(2)
Written description and computations, including at least the
following:

shall meet the standards on water supplies for suburban and rural fire
fighting as outlined in 1-3.1 of the National Fire Protection Association
When stormwater detention structures are proposed, they shall be
designed so that peak runoff after development shall not exceed,
nor be substantially less than, the peak runoff prior to development
for each of the storm events referred to in §§ 270-40B(1)(e) and
270-42C of these regulations. The structure(s) shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with good engineering practice
and the requirements of §§ 270-40 and 270-42. The basin(s) shall
be designed for easy access for maintenance purposes and be
provided with safety measures as needed. The following
information is to be provided for detention structures:
(a) Inflow and outflow hydrographs for the detention area;
(b) Maximum storage volume;

(4)
The construction of all permanent stormwater control structures
should be done so to ensure the proper management of stormwater
and the control of sedimentation during construction. Temporary
stormwater controls shall be constructed or installed if necessary
before the permanent structures are complete. This shall be
consistent with any erosion controls required by the Conservation
Commission and Department of Public Works according to
§ 270-41E, Erosion control and bank stabilization during
construction.
(5)
Apart from the area for roads and the stormwater system, there
shall be no exposed and unstable soil, unless specifically authorized
by the Planning Board upon recommendation from the
Conservation Commission and Department of Public Works.

1142 1999 Edition: "The requirements of Chapters 5 (Calculating Minimum
Water Supplies) and 6 (Water Supply) shall be performance-oriented and
shall allow the authority having jurisdiction the option to specify how these
water supplies are provided, which gives consideration to local conditions
and need." If hydrants are to be connected with any municipal water supply,
an agreement must be signed by the applicant and the appropriate water
district. If any fire ponds are to be constructed, the Belchertown Fire Chief
and the Conservation Commission must approve of the ponds' design. An
agreement with the Belchertown Fire Department and the Belchertown
Conservation Commission to maintain all fire ponds must be provided
before approval of the definitive subdivision plan.
§ 270-31. Infrastructure adequacy required.
The Planning Board may disapprove of a subdivision plan where, in the
opinion of the Planning Board after consulting with other town offices
and the Town Engineer, the existing surrounding municipal infrastructure,
such as street width and construction, bridge capacity, sanitary sewer,
public water, storm sewer, and fire protection, is insufficient or incapable
of handling the additional volumes of traffic, sewage, stormwater, or other
demands to be generated by the project.
§ 270-32. Review of plan; public hearing; action by Planning Board;
performance guarantee.
Review by the Board of Health as to suitability of land. At the time of
filing the definitive plan, the applicant shall also file with the Board of
Health two prints of the definitive plan, together with other necessary
documents and reports. The Board of Health shall report to the
Planning Board, in writing, its approval or disapproval of the plan. If
the Board of Health disapproves the plan, it shall make specific findings
as to which, if any, of the lots shown on such plan cannot be used
for building sites without injury to the public health. The Board of
Health shall include its specific findings and reasons for disapproval
in its report and, where possible, shall make recommendation for the
adjustment of the plan. Any approval of the plan by the Planning Board
shall only be given upon condition that the designated lots or land shall
not be built upon or served with any utilities, such as septic tanks, and
drainage, without prior consent of the Board of Health. The Planning
Board shall write the Board of Health's conditions on the plan and may
stamp unapproved lots as "Not A Building Lot."
A.
Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval, or
disapproval of a definitive plan is given, a public hearing shall be held
by the Planning Board. The public hearing shall be conducted according
to MGL c. 41, § 81T. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing

registered or certified mail to the applicant. Subdivision approval
can only be granted by an affirmative vote by the majority of the
Planning Board, not only a majority of the quorum. Any vote with
less than three members voting to approve the subdivision plan is
a denial of the subdivision plan. Any Planning Board member who
was not present for the entire public hearing may not vote on the
definitive subdivision plan.
(3)
Amended plan. If a definitive subdivision plan is disapproved by
the Planning Board in accord with Subsection C(3), the applicant
may submit a new application amended to conform to the rules
and regulations and/or the Board of Health recommendations upon
which the disapproval was based. The following shall apply:
The applicant shall provide the Board with 12 copies of the
amended plan and a fee in accordance with § 270-67 for filing

Planning Board in accord with Subsection B of this section;
(b)
The Planning Board shall review the submitted amended plan
and, after the required public hearing, shall approve, modify
and approve, or disapprove the amended plan in accord with
Subsection C(3) of this section;
(c)
The action of the Planning Board in respect to an amended
plan shall be limited to a determination of whether or not the
applicant has addressed, on the submitted amended definitive
subdivision plan, those items which were found to be
incomplete or incorrect on the original disapproved definitive
subdivision plan;
(d)
A disapproved amended definitive subdivision plan may be
amended in accord with this Subsection C(4); and
(e)
The full cost of any town engineering or planning consultant
services shall be paid by the applicant before any corrected
plan is endorsed by the Planning Board.
(f)
(4)
§ 270-32 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 270-32
270:413
Digital submission of plans. Prior to endorsement of the definitive
plan, a copy of the approved definitive plan must be submitted in
a digital (electronic) format consistent with the town's geographic
information system, or GIS. The applicant shall submit the
approved version of the plan on three-and-one-half-inch diskettes,
Iomega zip disc, or CD-ROM. The electronic plan will be reviewed
for its content and ability to meet the town's GIS standards. Failure
to submit these data in electronic format or to meet the standards
below will delay the Planning Board's endorsement until acceptable
digital plans are provided. Specific standards required include:
All digital mapping data must be delivered in a standard
geographic coordinate system. The coordinate system
employed by the town's GIS is Massachusetts Mainland Zone
horizontal datum of NAD83 (state plane units feet), and a
vertical datum of NGVD88.
(a)
All digital data must be delivered in one of the following
formats: AutoCAD dwg format, AutoCAD dxf format, ArcView
shapefile format, or Arc/Info e00 format.
(b)
All data must be topologically clean, meaning that polygons
are closed and lines connect at nodes. Features that naturally
connect (i.e., driveways to roads, parcel lines to roads and
water features, etc.) must connect seamlessly. If the digital
information provided is tiled across multiple sheets, the
abutting edges of each sheet must precisely match along the
join lines.
(c)
All digital line work must be developed as continuous lines
and rendered using line types/styles (i.e., dashed lines, etc).
Continuous lines that have been broken to appear dashed are
not acceptable.
(d)
All text in the AutoCAD files must appear on top of other
features and stored in separate layers. In the digital file, those
features under the text should not be erased in order to make
text clearer.
(e)
All features must be thematically organized in the CADD or GIS
data structure. Having all features in a single CADD layer or
GIS file is not acceptable.
(f)
Documentation of the data format must be provided and a
complete list of all layer names with descriptions. If multiple
files are delivered, each must be documented with a complete
description of its purpose. All documentation must be provided
in Microsoft Word format or ASCII text format, and shall be
included on the electronic media containing the electronic plan
data.
(g)
(5)
§ 270-32 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 270-32
270:414
Documentation must be provided on the method used to gather
the data, an estimation of the horizontal and vertical accuracy,
and the date of data capture.
(h)
Endorsement.
An approved plan shall not be endorsed until after the mandatory
twenty-day appeal period has elapsed as certified by the Town
Clerk, or after issuance of a final decree of the court sustaining the
approval of such plan, if appealed, and not until the applicant has:
Posted the necessary performance guarantee(s), or placed
sufficient lots under covenant;
(a)
Made the necessary corrections on the plan if conditional
approval was given or modification required;
(b)
Delivered one set of the Mylar originals of the plan (for
recording at the Hampshire Registry of Deeds) and three
copies of the definitive plan if no corrections were necessary;
[Note: If corrections were required by the Planning Board,
seven prints shall be delivered.]
(c)
(d) Submitted the approved plan in the required digital format;
Caused to be executed in a form acceptable to the Town
Counsel all deeds of easements, as shown on the plan or
required by the Planning Board, and submitted such deeds and
documents to the Planning Board; and
(e)
Signed an agreement to pay for town engineering or legal
review service, and public hearing advertisement. (See
§ 270-67.)
(f)
(1)
Failure of the applicant to meet any or all of the above
requirements shall be full and sufficient reason to withhold
endorsement.
(2)
If the applicant fails to submit the required guarantees or covenant
agreement, easements, digital version of the approved plan, and
other documentation, thereby delaying the endorsement of the plan
by the Planning Board for more than six months, the Planning
Board, on its own motion, may exercise its power to modify, amend,
or rescind its approval of the subdivision plan.
(3)
D.
Performance guarantee. Before the Planning Board's endorsement of
the approved definitive plan, as submitted or modified, the applicant
shall agree to complete the required improvements as specified in
Articles V and VI for all lots in the subdivision. Such construction and
installation shall be secured by one, or in part by one and in part by
another, of the methods listed in Subsection E(1), (2), (3) and (4). The
E.

method or combination of methods may be selected and, from time to
time, varied by the applicant:
Approval with bond (Form F-1).49 By a proper bond sufficient, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, to secure the performance of the
construction of ways and installation of municipal services required
for the lots in the subdivision shown on the plan. The Planning
Board may require that the applicant specify the time within which
such construction shall be completed.
(1)
Approval with money or negotiable securities (Form F-2, F-3 or
F-4).50 By a deposit of money or negotiable securities sufficient, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, to secure performance of the
construction of ways and installation of municipal services required
for lots in the subdivision shown on the plan. The Planning Board
may require that the applicant specify the time within which such
construction shall be completed.
Savings passbook account made out to the Town of
Belchertown and controlled by the Town Treasurer-Collector,
with agreement from the bank that no withdrawal from the
account shall be made without approval of the Planning Board
(Form F-2).
(a)
(b) Bank certificate (Form F-3).
(c) Certified cashier's check or bank check (Form F-4).
(2)
Approval with covenant (Form F-5).51 By a covenant, executed and
duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the land,
whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve a lot
before such lot may be built upon and conveyed, other than by
mortgage deed, provided that a mortgagee who acquires title to
the mortgaged premises by foreclosure or otherwise and any
succeeding owner of such premises or part thereof may sell any
such lot, subject to that portion of the covenant which provides that
no lot shall be built upon until such ways and services have been
provided to service such lot, and provided, further, that nothing
herein shall be deemed to prohibit a conveyance by single deed,
subject to such covenant, of either the entire parcel of land shown
on the subdivision plan or of all lots not previously released by the
Planning Board. A deed of any part of the subdivision in violation
hereof shall be voidable by the grantee prior to the release of the
covenant, but not later than three years from the date of such deed.
Such a covenant shall be inscribed on the definitive plan or
contained in a separate document referred to on the plan and
delivered to the Planning Board. Form F-5 must be recorded

in the Hampshire Registry of Deeds with the endorsed
subdivision plan. Registry document numbers must be
returned to the Planning Board.
When improvements, ways and services have been completed
to the satisfaction of the Planning Board, the Planning Board
will then authorize, in writing, on the appropriate form (see
Appendix A),52 a release of the conditions for recording in the
Registry of Deeds, and the conditions relating to such lots shall
terminate.
(b)
Approval with lender's agreement (Form F-6).53 By delivery to the
Planning Board of an agreement executed after the recording of
the first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan, or
a portion thereof, given as security for advances to be made to
the applicant by the lender. The agreement shall be executed by
the applicant and the lender and shall provide for retention by the
lender of funds sufficient, in the opinion of the Planning Board and
otherwise due the applicant, to secure the construction of ways
and installation of municipal services. Said agreement shall also
provide for a schedule of disbursements which may be made to
the applicant upon completion of various stages of work and shall
further provide that in the event that the work is not completed
within the time set forth by the applicant, any funds remaining
undisturbed shall be made available for completion.
(4)
Procedure. The applicant shall provide the Planning Board with a
cost estimate, in a form prescribed by the Board (see Appendix A,
Form G),54 of the construction of ways, installation of municipal
services, the construction of necessary drainage works, and the
securing of wetlands protections as approved in the definitive plan.
The consulting Town Engineer or Director of Public Works may
review this cost estimate and make recommendations to the
Planning Board;
(a)
The Planning Board may modify the applicant's estimate and
determine the amount sufficient as a performance guarantee
by the Town Treasurer-Collector, based upon the Town
Engineer's or Director of Public Works' recommendations; and
(b)
The Planning Board shall determine the amounts to be retained
as a performance guarantee, upon the subdivider's application
for partial release of such guarantee, in accord with the
provisions of § 270-33.

§ 270-32 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 270-32
270:417
Board is for a two-year period. The Planning Board may require the
developer to construct the project in phases. When phases are used,
the entire project is to be reviewed, and if approved, approval will
be for the entire subdivision development. Though approval is for the
entire project, the developer may not proceed to a subsequent phase
until the previous phase is complete. Each phase has two years to be
completed. The total project approval is two years times the number of
phases, not to exceed eight years total. Upon written request from the
applicant, the Planning Board may, at its discretion, grant an extension
of time. Such extension shall be made in the form of an agreement to
be executed and affixed to the bond, lender's agreement, or covenant.
In the case of a surety company bond, such an agreement shall
not be effective until the surety company delivers to the Planning
Board a written statement that the surety company agrees to the
alteration of the completion schedule, and that such alteration shall
not relieve or affect the liability of the surety company.
(1)
In the case of a covenant, the Planning Board may grant final
approval of the definitive plan conditional upon the completion of
the construction of all ways and the installation of utilities within a
specified time period from the date the covenant was endorsed by
the Planning Board.
(2)
Failure to complete such improvements within the time period
specified in the bond, lender's agreement, covenant, or other
security, or in any written agreement for extension thereof shall
automatically rescind approval of the plan.
(3)
Increase of performance guarantee. If the specified subdivision
improvements in accordance with Articles V and VI are not completed
within two years of the date of the bond, deposit of money, lender's
agreement or covenant, the Planning Board may require an estimate
of the costs of the remaining work. The Planning Board may then
increase the amount of the performance guarantee proportionately, and
establish a new date for completion of the improvements. Failure of the
developer to complete the improvements within the two-year approval
period, or any extension thereof, shall not relieve the developer's
obligation to pay for costs exceeding the amount specified in the
performance guarantee to complete the improvements.
G.
Recording of plan. Within 21 days from the date of the Planning Board's
endorsement of the definitive plan, the plan should be recorded in the
Hampshire Registry of Deeds or in the Land Court. Failure to record
the plan within six months of the date of endorsement constitutes an
automatic rescission of the plan.
At the time of recording the endorsed definitive subdivision plan
in the Hampshire Registry of Deeds, all public easements and
covenants shall also be recorded. The originals must then be
transmitted to the Planning Board to be filed with the Town Clerk.

§ 270-33. Release of performance guarantee.
Following receipt of notification of recording, the Planning Board
shall file one print of the definitive plan with the Building Inspector,
the Department of Public Works, the Board of Health and the
Conservation Commission. In accordance with the Subdivision
Control Law, the Building Inspector, if approval with covenant
is noted or affixed to the plan, shall not issue any permit for
construction of a building on any lot within the subdivision without
receipt from the Planning Board of a copy of Form H (Certificate
of Completion and Release of Municipal Interest in Subdivision
Performance Security)55 or certified statement releasing the lot(s)
in question, such as Form F (Application for Partial Release and/or
Exchange of Performance Guarantees or Covenants),56 listing the
lots which were released.
(2)
Partial release. The subdivider may apply to the Planning Board for
partial release of the performance guarantee. Release can be made
only upon partial completion and installation of required improvements
as specified in Articles V and VI of these rules and regulations when
a bond or deposit of money is the performance guarantee. Upon
application, the penal sum of any such bond, or amount of any deposit
held, may, from time to time, be reduced by the Planning Board and the
obligations of the parties of the performance guarantee released by the
Board in whole or in part in accordance with the procedures expressed
below.
A.
Procedures for full or partial release.
The applicant, upon completion of construction and installation of
required improvements in a subdivision, may request a release of
conditions or of a performance guarantee secured by a bond or a
deposit of money, by:
Sending a written statement that the applicant has completed
the construction and installation of ways and utilities covered
by the performance guarantee by registered mail to the
Planning Board and the Town Clerk, in accordance with
Articles V and VI of these rules and regulations, and by filling
out and filing three copies of Form F (Application for Partial
Release and/or Exchange of Performance Guarantees or
Covenants), Appendix A.57

at the applicant's expense, or the Director of Public Works.
This document is to certify that all structures have been
installed, and all requirements have been met as specified
in these rules and regulations and in accordance with the
approved plans.
Requests for final release of conditions shall be accompanied by a
record plan as required in § 270-61.
(2)
Approval of release.
Before the Planning Board will release the interest of the town in a
performance guarantee, the Planning Board shall:
Obtain, in writing, from those town officials designated by the
Planning Board, a statement that all work required by these
rules and regulations under the jurisdiction of the town has
been inspected by them serving the lots in question, including
streets, shoulders, sidewalks, storm drainage, bridges, sewers,
curbs, etc., and that the method of construction and the
materials used in performance of such work meet with their
approval (Form G).59
(a)
Obtain, in writing, a certificate from the Belchertown Water
District certifying that the water supply system was installed
in accordance with their rules and regulations, if applicable.
(b)
(1)
Upon the completion of the construction of ways and the
installation of municipal services in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Planning Board, security for the performance
of which was given by bond, deposit or covenant, or upon the
performance of any covenant with respect to any lot, the applicant
shall send by registered mail to the Town Clerk and the Planning
Board a written statement that the said construction or installation
in connection with which such bond, deposit or covenant has been
given has been completed in accordance with said rules and
regulations, such statement to contain the address of the applicant.
If the Planning Board determines that said construction or
installation has been completed, it shall release the interest of the
town in such bond and return the bond or the deposit to the person
who furnished the same, or release the covenant by appropriate
instrument, duly acknowledged, which may be recorded. If the
Board determines that said construction or installation has not
been completed, it shall specify in a notice sent by registered
mail to the applicant and to the Town Clerk the details wherein
said construction or installation fails to comply with its rules and
regulations and upon failure so to do within forty-five days after
the receipt by said Clerk of said statement all obligations under
the bond shall cease and terminate by operation of law, any deposit

shall be returned and any such covenant shall become void. In
the event that said forty-five-day period expires without such
specification, or without the release and return of the bond or
return of the deposit or release of the covenant as aforesaid, the
said Clerk shall issue a certificate to such effect, duly
acknowledged, which may be recorded. Any such bond may be
enforced and any such deposit may be applied by the Planning
Board for the benefit of the town, as provided in MGL c. 41 § 81Y,
upon failure of the performance for which any such bond or deposit
was given to the extent of the reasonable cost to such city or town
of completing such construction and installation.
Upon failure of the Planning Board to act on such an application
for release of conditions within 45 days after the receipt of the
application by the Town Clerk, all obligations under the bond shall
cease and terminate by operation of law, and any deposit shall be
returned and such covenant shall become void.
(3)
Any such bond may be enforced and any such deposit may be
applied by the Planning Board for the benefit of the Town of
Belchertown as provided in MGL c. 41, § 81Y, upon failure of the
performance for which any bond or deposit was given, to the extent
of the reasonable cost to the town of completing such construction
and installation.
(4)
Release of lots from covenant. The subdivider may request a release of
lots from covenant in exchange for a bond or surety, provided that:
The amount of the surety or bond shall be determined by the
Planning Board, consulting as it deems necessary with the Director
of Public Works or Town Engineer, based on its estimates for
constructing the road within existing approval. The amount of the
surety or bond shall be determined on a request-by-request basis,
and each request shall be judged on its own merits.
(1)
The amount of the surety or bond on existing lots for which prior
surety or bond has been given may be increased by the Planning
Board should the specified subdivision improvements, in
accordance with these rules and regulations, not be completed
within the allotted time period as specified in § 270-32. Such
increase would take into consideration increased construction
costs.
(2)
D.
Modification. After a definitive plan has been approved, the location
and width of ways, drainage facilities, and utilities shown on the plan
shall not be changed unless the plan is amended according to the
provisions set forth in MGL c. 41, § 81W, and approved by the Planning
Board.

MGL c. 41, § 81W.
(2)
B.
Corrections. No change or deviation shall be permitted unless it has
been approved by the Town Engineer, the Director of Public Works or
the Planning Board.
C.
Approval. After the Planning Board has approved a modification, the
applicant shall show the approved changes on the original drawings of
the definitive plan, or submit a fully revised plan. Either plan must be
recorded with the Hampshire Registry of Deeds and the book and page
numbers must be provided to the Planning Board.
D.
Minor technical corrections. If the Planning Board, after consulting
with the Director of Public Works or Town Engineer, deems a proposed
deviation a minor technical correction which does not substantively
alter the approved design of the roadway, drainage, and utilities, the
Board may review the change without requiring the provisions of MGL
c. 41, § 81W. The applicant must submit seven prints of the original
definitive plan, with proposed changes drawn on in red. Ten prints of
the definitive plan with proposed changes drawn on in red shall be
provided to the Board if the subdivision is served by a public sewer or
water line.

§ 270-36 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 270-36
270:426
The length of a dead-end street allowed by right is 600 feet. A
longer dead-end street is allowed up to 1,200 feet if a
corresponding amount of open space in the subdivision is dedicated
(See § 270-9 for the definition of "Open Space".) The formula is
that for every two acres of open space dedicated, 100 feet of street
length is allowed, up to 1,200. If a second dead-end extending from
the first one is desired, an additional two acres of open space per
100 feet of street length is required.
(1)
The length of the dead-end street shall be measured along the
center line of the street right-of-way from the sideline of the
nearest intersecting through street to the outside edge of
pavement at the farthest end of the dead-end street, including the
cul-de-sac or other turnaround, if any.
(2)
Except within the limits allowed under Subsection F(1) above,
no existing dead-end street may be extended to create a longer
dead-end street and no new permanent dead-end street may be
connected to an existing dead-end street.
(3)
No more than one new permanent dead-end street may be
connected to another new permanent dead-end street. The farthest
point of either such dead-end street may not exceed the limits
allowed under Subsection F(1) above.
(4)
Except for loop streets, a new permanent dead-end street shall be
provided with a cul-de-sac at its end, having a minimum outside
edge of pavement radius of 60 feet and a minimum right-of-way
radius of 65 feet. The maximum right-of-way radius shall not
exceed 90 feet.
(5)
The Planning Board may require a cul-de-sac to have a center
island, which shall be graded and seeded, left with natural
vegetation, or appropriately planted with trees or shrubs, as
determined by the Planning Board.
(6)
In limited situations, because of unusual topographical conditions
or other natural features, the Planning Board may permit an
alternative turnaround design in lieu of a cul-de-sac, provided the
alternative design is acceptable to the Director of Public Works. Tback-
arounds may be used on temporary or unusually short deadend
streets, or those with excessively steep slopes.
(7)
The Planning Board may require that provision be made for future
extension of a proposed new dead-end street to provide access
to adjoining land if the Board believes it desirable to provide a
potential connection for a through street.
(8)
Subdivision streets connecting to a through street within 300 feet
of each other are deemed a single access and do not themselves
constitute through streets.
(9)
§ 270-36 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 270-36
270:427
§ 270-37. Easements.
The applicant shall deliver to the Planning Board appropriate instruments
(deeds) for any necessary easements in the name of the Town of
Belchertown for utilities, watercourses or drainage channels, temporary
turnarounds, or other purposes, and to provide for the construction and
installation of such utilities before the final bond is released. The Planning
Board shall deliver these instruments to the Town Attorney for review
before the applicant records the plan with the Hampshire Registry of Deeds.
§ 270-38. Open spaces and protection of natural and important
cultural features.
Natural and significant cultural features must be retained as much as
possible. Major features of the land, such as existing walls, fences, wooded
areas, orchards, agricultural fields, rock outcrops, culverts, large trees, and
other notable features must be shown on the plan. The Planning Board may
request comment from the Historic Commission or any other relevant body
as to the cultural importance of the site. The developer will be responsible
for any archaeological study conducted.
§ 270-39. Compliance with zoning.
No plan of a subdivision shall be approved unless all of the building lots
shown on the plan comply with Chapter 145, Zoning, of the Code of the
Town of Belchertown. All subdivisions shall comply with special
requirements for overlay zoning districts as required by Chapter 145,
Zoning (for example, the Aquifer Protection Overlay District's runoff
requirements).
Temporary dead-end.
A temporary dead-end shall be allowed only where, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, it is essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision and where it is part of a street
or way that will eventually be extended to complete the
subdivision as approved. The design of a temporary deadend
shall have a cul-de-sac shown and noted on the plan as
temporary, and such property lines shall be those which would
normally have been required or used without the cul-de-sac.
(a)
Layout of the cul-de-sac beyond the normal street right-ofway
lines shall be in the form of an easement to the Town
of Belchertown covering said premises included in the cul-desac
turnaround. When the street is extended into the adjoining
property, the easement shall become void.
(b)
In a case of a temporary dead-end becoming permanent, open
space must be dedicated according to § 270-36F(1), and the
cul-de-sac easements become permanent parts of the street
layout.

ARTICLE VI
Improvements
§ 270-41. Site and earthwork. [Amended 7-26-2005]
Development shall be designed and constructed for as little disturbance
as possible to the natural landform. Development shall demonstrate
appropriate terrain-adaptive design and construction techniques. Extensive
grading shall be avoided. An inability to design a particular development
without significant disturbance to the natural landform indicates that the
site should not accommodate the full amount of proposed development.
Alternate site design and construction measures are encouraged to mitigate
the effects of development on steep slopes.
Materials and construction methods. All materials and construction
methods used for roadway excavation and embankments shall conform
to Section 100 of the Standard Specifications.
A.
Natural and cultural features. All natural and cultural features, such
as large trees, watercourses, stone walls, scenic points, historic spots,
and similar community assets, shall be preserved. This protection and
preservation will add to the attractiveness and value of the subdivision.
B.
Setting lines and grades. The applicant shall employ a professional
engineer or registered land surveyor to set all lines and grades in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board, Director of Public Works
and the Town Engineer.
C.
Clearing the right-of-way. The area for 10 feet from the pavement edge
shall be cleared and grubbed of all stumps, brush, roots, and like
material. The Planning Board may require a greater cleared area to
accommodate drainage, to improve sight distances, and to accomplish
other public purposes, The Planning Board will determine this upon
advice from the Director of Public Works, the Police Department, or
other consulting authority.
D.
Erosion control and bank stabilization during construction. All cleared
and excavated land must be secured to prevent erosion. An explanation
of proposed erosion controls must be submitted as part of the definitive
plan and must satisfy the Planning Board, the Director of Public Works,
the Town Engineer, and the Conservation Commission.
E.
Unsuitable material. All unsuitable material for road construction, such
as peat, topsoil, and highly organic silt or clay, or any other material
that, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, is considered to
be detrimental to the subgrade, shall be removed and replaced with
ordinary borrow conforming to M1.03.0 of the Standard Specifications.
Type A shall be used within 12 inches of the top of subgrade and Type
B above, placed in twelve-inch loose lifts and compacted to 95% of
maximum density as determined by ASTM designation 1557-70 Method
D. Written certification of material used and compaction must be
F.
§ 270-41 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 270-41
270:433
§ 270-42. Drainage.
submitted to the Planning Board and approved by the Town Engineer,
the Director of Public Works and the Planning Board. It is the
developer's responsibility to provide laboratory test results to certify
that the construction materials conform to the required specifications.
Subgrade. The subgrade shall be shaped to a true surface conforming
to the lines and grades indicated in the approved definitive plan (cross
section and profile) and, where original ground, shall be compacted
to 90%, as defined in Subsection F above, to a depth of six inches.
A tolerance of 1/2 inch above or below finished subgrade will be
permitted, provided that this difference is not maintained over 50 feet
and the required crown (cross slope) is maintained.
G.
Cutting and filling; limitations on cut and fill. The depth of any cut
area or the height of any fill, as measured from natural grade, shall
not be greater than seven feet. The total combined depth of' any cut
area or height of any fill as a result of subdivision grading or any
subsequent grading shall not total more than seven feet, as measured
from natural grade. Any cuts and fills for the subdivision development
must be quantified in the definitive plan.
H.
Fill areas. In fill areas, the embankment shall be ordinary borrow
specified and placed as in Subsection E above.
I.
Removal of earth from the site. The removal of earth from the
subdivision site is regulated by the Town of Belchertown Zoning Bylaw,
Chapter 145, Zoning, of the Code of the Town of Belchertown, § 145-29.
Site construction is to conform closely to the natural features. As a
result, there should be a minimal amount of earth to be removed. If
the developer seeks to remove gravel, sand, or other earth beyond
the amount necessary to construct the improvements according to the
endorsed definitive plan, the developer must apply for a special permit
for earth removal.
J.
The priority of a subdivision's drainage system is to prevent property
damage from storm runoff. This includes erosion, flooding, surface
water pollution, groundwater pollution, and excessive alteration of the
natural water flow. The Planning Board requires that natural waters,
both surface water and groundwater, be recharged. Drainage
structures and artificial wetlands shall be designed to remove
pollutants, such as road salt, sand, oil, gasoline, and other automotive
residues, from runoff.
The Planning Board may disapprove a definitive plan if drainage is
not shown to meet the requirements in these regulations.
(1)
The Board of Health has authority to review soil logs and make
recommendations regarding drainage conditions. When the Board
(2)
A.
§ 270-41 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 270-42
270:434
of Health rejects or conditions the plan, the Planning Board cannot
override the decision.
Construction. The construction of the drainage system, including
method of construction and quality of materials used, shall conform
with the definitive plan and Section 200 of the Standard Specifications.
If, in the opinion of the Town Engineer, the subdivision cannot have an
adequate drainage system, the definitive plan shall be disapproved.
B.
Design capacity.
Runoff calculations for the design of a storm drain system shall be
performed according to Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55), latest
edition, or, when appropriate, Technical Release No. 20 (TR-20),
latest edition, by the Natural Resources Conservation Services,
United States Department of Agriculture. The Engineer shall
design the drainage system in accordance with natural drainage
boundaries of the total contributing drainage area, using the
minimum of a ten-year-design-frequency storm per § 270-29D.
(1)
Where, in the opinion of the Town Engineer, flooding would
produce property damage or a safety hazard, the design-frequency
storm shall be increased to 25 years. A one-hundred-year-designfrequency
storm shall be used for all bridge openings or major
culverts or detention and retention basin areas.
(2)
C.
Catch basins. Where feasible, stormwater should be directed away from
the roadway. Stormwater shall not be permitted to cross any roadway
upon the surface but must be piped underground. Stormwater runoff
shall not be permitted to flow upon the road surface for a longer
distance than 400 feet before it enters the underground system or
is diverted off the roadway to ditches or swales. Where used, catch
basins shall be located on both sides of the roadway or on continuous
grades at intervals of no more than 400 feet, at all sags in the roadway
at intersecting streets, to prevent surface water from crossing the
intersection.
D.
Connections to town drainage. Proper connections shall be made with
any existing town-owned drainage system within 400 feet of the
subdivision if, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works, that system
has the capacity to absorb the flows from the project area.
E.
Drainage pipe. Drainage pipe within the roadway shall be reinforced
concrete pipe or ACCM galvanized or aluminum pipe or corrugated
polyethylene pipe (N-12 or equivalent). These pipes shall be joined with
positive connection joints, or as approved by the Town Engineer or the
Director of Public Works, and have a minimum diameter of 12 inches.
F.
Pipe bedding. Drainage pipe shall be bedded and backfilled with freedraining
granular material with an elevation of 12 inches above the
pipe.

Materials. Manholes and catch basins shall be either precast or castin-
place concrete. A typical detail noting materials, and dimension and
construction details shall be included on the definitive plan.
H.
Drain manholes. Drain manholes shall be located at every change in
grade or direction of drainage line and at catch basin connections and
shall not exceed 400 feet apart in a continuous system.
I.
Frames, grates and covers. Iron casting for manhole frames and covers
and catch basin frames and grates shall be in accordance with the
standard specifications.
(1) Manhole covers shall have three-inch lettering to read "DRAIN."
Catch basin grates shall be checkerboard-type grates, such as
LeBaron LF 248-2 Type F or the equal or Neenah R-3210-L
cascade-type grates (if required for capacity).
(2)
J.
Subdrainage. If subdrainage is required, perforated concrete, PVC or
ACCM galvanized or aluminum pipes shall be used in bedding of stone
3/4 inch to 1 1/4 inches brought to the top of the pipe. The remaining
trench shall be backfilled with coarse bank-run gravel or coarse sand.
K.
Compacting and paving around manholes. Compacting and paving
around manholes shall be subject to the standard specifications.
L.
Sheet flow. When sheet flow is approved as a method to control
stormwater runoff, language should be required on each property deed
to allow for water to follow its natural course without the possibility
of liability to the town, and deed restrictions should be included to
prohibit the property owners from stopping the flow of water or
diverting it to another property.
M.
Construction. The pavement structure shall comply with applicable
sections of Section 400 of the Standard Specifications and shall comply
with the typical street cross section in Appendix B.65
A.
Gravel base course. The gravel base course shall be gravel borrow
(M1.03.0 Type B) in accordance with Section 405 of the Standard
Specifications. A tolerance of 1/2 inch above or below finished subgrade
in critical areas may be permitted, provided that this difference is
not maintained over 50 feet and the required crown (cross slope) is
maintained and a written certificate of compliance is submitted to the
Planning Board.
B.
Binder course. The binder course shall be asphalt concrete in
accordance with Section 460, Class I Bituminous Concrete Pavement
Type I-1 (Binder Course Mix) of the Standard Specifications.

USER CHARGE SYSTEM
GENERAL REFERENCES
Sewers (bylaw)  See Ch. 104. Sewer use (regulations)  See Ch. 256.
§ 278-1. Purpose; authority.
§ 278-2. Notice of fees and charges.
Notification of fees and other charges assessed under this user charge
system shall be provided to users in conjunction with a regular bill to
be issued quarterly under most circumstances, but in no case less than
annually. This notification shall include the rate and that portion of the user
charges which is attributable to wastewater treatment services.
§ 278-3. Financial management system.
The Town shall maintain a financial management system that will accurately
account for revenues generated by this user charge system and
expenditures for operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the
treatment system, based on an adequate budget identifying the basis for
determining the annual operation and maintenance costs and the costs
of personnel, material, energy and administration. The budget shall be
prepared on an annual basis and shall be approved by Town Meeting
This user charge system has been designed to produce revenues
required for the operation and maintenance of the Town of
Belchertown's wastewater treatment plant and sanitary sewers,
including capital costs for wastewater treatment plant upgrade and
sanitary sewer extensions.
A.
This user charge system is also designed to generate sufficient
revenues to cover, at a minimum, replacement stock for sewers; costs
relating to the replacement and repair of sewers, including street work
and maintenance of all equipment and related appurtenances necessary
for provision of wastewater treatment services; all costs of chemicals
and other supplies relating to the treatment of wastewater; costs
relating to personnel for wastewater collection and treatment systems;
and all administrative costs relating to operation of the wastewater
collection and treatment system and the collection of fees as provided
for by this user charge system.
B.
This user charge system has been developed in accordance with the
requirements, providing that each user which discharges pollutants
that cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or sludge
from the treatment works shall pay for such increased cost.

vote. An independent audit of the financial management system shall be
performed on a periodic basis.
§ 278-4. Methodology.
This user charge system provides for the recovery of wastewater and sewerrelated
costs from three sources: user fees, wastewater treatment
assessments and general property tax rates. This system has been designed
to acknowledge that the improvements to the wastewater treatment works
will benefit the community as a whole and will benefit future as well as
current users.
User fees. User fees shall be developed based on the annual projected
budget for operation and maintenance of the wastewater treatment
facilities, including maintenance and repair of the collection system.
These costs shall be allocated to all users based on equivalent dwelling
units as calculated per 310 CMR 15.203 (Title V design criteria) or
based on estimates of the long-term average flow for the facility or
other method as deemed appropriate by the Board of Selectmen to
capture the costs and expenses of the services provided by the Town
through such system. Multiple-family dwelling establishments shall not
be calculated below 0.67 EDU per living unit. Where a commercial or
industrial user discharges wastes of unusual characteristics, the Board
of Selectmen may impose additional fees to cover the costs associated
with treatment of such wastes. Billing will be conducted quarterly as
described herein:
Any person proposing a new discharge into the sewer system or
a substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants is
required to complete a connection application. The Board of
Selectmen, acting through the Department of Public Works, will
review, and if found appropriate, approve, the connection
application constituting the issuance of a connection permit. Once
a sewer connection permit is issued, it is the permit holders
responsibility to notify the Department of Public Works at least
24 hours in advance of any work related to the installation of
the sanitary sewer service. The Department will schedule the
necessary inspections. If the connection is installed properly and
ready for use, the Department of Public Works will notify the
appropriate Town agencies, and sewer billing will be implemented
in the following manner:
For existing, developed property, and modifications to an
existing connection which will result in a substantial change in
the volume or character of pollutants, sewer billing will begin
as of the date the connection is deemed complete.
(a)
For new construction requiring a building permit, sewer billing
will begin as of the date the building inspector issues a
certificate of occupancy. For multiple-unit facilities, sewer
billing will begin for the total number of units for which the

Modifications to existing accounts will only be considered upon written
request from the property owners or their authorized representative.
The Town may, from time to time, audit accounts on file and make
changes as required. All modifications will be implemented as of the
date written notification was received, in the manner previously
described.
Building Inspector issued a certificate of occupancy, during the
billing period (quarterly).
New accounts, regardless of type, will be established in the
following manner:
If the account status is billable prior to the middle of the
quarter, sewer billing will include the entire quarterly charges;
if the account status is billable on or after the middle of the
quarter, billing will begin on the first day of the next quarter.
(a)
Account status will remain as billable unless the property is
deemed uninhabitable by the Building Inspector or by the
issuance of a demolition permit, condemnation order, or any
similar order that may be issued by the local, state, or federal
agencies with the proper authorization to do so. It is the
property owners responsibility to notify the Town when their
property becomes uninhabitable. Abatements and/or status
change, if approved, will be effective as of the date written
notification was received by the Town. Properties deemed
uninhabitable will be required to obtain a connection permit,
in accordance with Chapter 256 of the Code of Belchertown.
(b)
(2)
Wastewater treatment assessments. The capital costs for wastewater
treatment plant improvements shall be recovered in majority through
a wastewater treatment assessment applied to all users. Wastewater
treatment assessments will apply to all users based on equivalent
single-family dwelling units as per 310 CMR 15.203 (Title V design
criteria) or based on estimates of the long-term average flow for the
facility or other method as deemed appropriate by the Board of
Selectmen to capture the costs and expenses of the services provided
by the Town through such system. Additionally, a portion of the capital
costs for the wastewater treatment system improvements may be
funded through the general tax rolls.
For the purposes of calculating the wastewater treatment
assessment, the total capital costs for the improvements over the
loan period will be divided by the existing equivalent dwelling
units. This will determine the wastewater treatment assessment
per equivalent single-family dwelling. The wastewater treatment
assessment for other types of residential or commercial facilities
will be determined by multiplying the single-family equivalency
factor times the single-family dwelling wastewater treatment
assessment. That portion of the capital costs for the wastewater
treatment improvements which is not covered by revenues

§ 278-6. Inactive accounts.
A sewer connection permit may be considered as an inactive account if
the owner of record can provide satisfactory documentation, in the form
of water or electrical usage, that the premises have not been occupied for
a period of 366 consecutive days. Those accounts that are deemed to be
inactive shall be placed in an inactive file and not billed for the current fiscal
year. The status of inactive accounts shall be checked from time to time
and reviewed annually. When an inactive account has been reoccupied and
reconnected to the utilities, the permit shall be considered active and billed
generated by the wastewater treatment assessment will be
adsorbed by the general tax revenues.
General property tax. As discussed above, a portion of the capital costs
for wastewater treatment facility improvements may be funded from
the general property tax revenues. The amount to be funded from
the general property tax rolls may decrease as additional users are
brought online. The amount to be funded from the general tax rolls
will be determined each year by the Board of Selectmen by subtracting
projected revenues from betterment and wastewater treatment
assessments from the total capital recovery costs for the year.
C.
Abatements shall be given for errors in billing calculations, provided
such errors are brought to the Board's attention within 60 calendar
days of the billing date. Abatements may be granted for financial
hardship if it is in the opinion of the Board of Selectmen that such
abatement is warranted. Abatements will only be granted for sewer
costs; assessments and betterments will still apply.
A.
Submission of abatement request.
The Board of Selectmen or its designee shall be responsible for
issuance and/or denial of sewer abatement requests.
(1)
A sewer abatement applicant shall request issuance of abatement
in writing and submit it to the Board of Selectmen or its designee.

B.
Time limits for applications.
Review and comment by the Board of Selectmen or its designee will
begin once the applicant has provided sufficient documentation to

The issuance of a water supply certificate by the Board shall certify that
the private well may be used as a drinking water supply in accordance with
105 CMR 410.180. The property owner must obtain a certificate prior to the
issuance of an occupancy permit for new construction and before use of the
well water for domestic purposes for existing structures.74
Within 21 days of request of the application, the Board may grant
the petitioner's application for a permit when, in the Board's opinion,
the construction will not result in harm to the public health or the
environment. But when it appears to the Board that such harm may
result, the Board may deny the permit application. The Board may
request additional information from the petitioner before rendering a
decision.

to the intake portion of the well or transfer water from one
formation to another.
Permanent construction materials shall not impart toxic
substances, taste, odors or bacterial contamination to the water in
the well.
(2)
The driller shall operate all equipment according to generally
accepted standards in the industry and shall take appropriate
precautions to prevent damage, injury or other loss to persons and
property at the drilling site.
(3)
Construction site waste and materials shall be disposed of in such
a way as to avoid contamination of the well and the aquifer. During
any time that the well is unattended, the contractor shall make
every reasonable effort to secure the well in such a way as to
prevent either tampering with the well or the introduction of
foreign material into the well.
(4)
All water used for drilling, well development or to mix a drilling
fluid shall be obtained from a source which will not result in
contamination of the well or the water-bearing zones penetrated by
the well.
(5)
Water shall be conveyed in clean, sanitary containers or waterlines
and shall be chlorinated. Water from wetlands, swamps, small lakes
and other similar surface features shall not be used.
(6)
All drilling fluids shall be nontoxic. Drilling fluid additives shall be
stored in clean containers and shall be free of material that may
adversely affect the well, the aquifer or the quality of the water to
be pumped from the well.
(7)
All wells, including those that have been hydrofractured, shall be
developed in order to remove fine materials introduced into the
pore spaces or crevices during construction. One or more of the
following methods shall be used for development: overpumping,
backwashing, surging, jetting and air-lift pumping.
(8)
The completed well shall be sufficiently straight so that there will
be no interference with installation, alignment, operation or future
removal of the permanent well pump.
(9)
Well casing.
Private water supply wells shall be constructed using either steel or
thermoplastic well casing. The casing shall be of adequate strength
and durability to withstand anticipated formation and hydrostatic
pressures, the forces imposed on it during installation and the
corrosive effects of the local hydrogeologic environment.
(1)
All casing used in the construction of private water supply wells
shall be free of pits, breaks, gouges, deep scratches and other

§ 285-8. Water quantity.
The applicant shall submit to the Board for review and approval a pumping
test report. This report shall include the name and address of the well
owner; location of well, giving tax map and lot number and street address,
if available; well depth; depth to bedrock, when applicable; casing type, size
and, when applicable, length into bedrock; static water level immediately
before pumping commenced; date the pump test was performed; and a
demonstration that the well can yield the required volume of water within a
twenty-four-hour period.
defects. Upon completion of the installation procedure, the entire
length of the casing above the intake shall be watertight.
Well screen. A well screen is necessary for all drilled wells that are
completed in unconsolidated formations. Wells completed in bedrock do
not require a screen unless the bedrock is brittle in nature or has a
potential for collapse. The well screen aperture openings, screen length
and diameter shall not limit the aquifer's water-yielding characteristics
while preventing access of soil particles.
D.
Grouting and sealing.
Private wells drilled in bedrock shall be grouted from the top of
the weathered rock face to a minimum of 10 feet into competent
bedrock.
(1)
All wells completed with the casing extending above grade shall
have a surface seal designed to eliminate the possibility of surface
water flowing down the annular space between the well casing
and the surrounding backfilled materials. The grouting seal should
remain intact and undisturbed from the elevation of the waterline
connection down.
(2)
E.
Wellhead completion.
Well casing terminating above grade shall extend at least 12 inches
above the predetermined ground surface at the wellhead, except
that when the well is located in a floodplain, the well casing shall
extend at least two feet above the level of the highest recorded
flood.
(1)
Well construction design shall ensure that surface water does not
enter the well through the opening or by seepage through the
ground surface. The applicant shall ensure that the grade
surrounding the wellhead for a distance of five feet from center
shall slope at least 2% to prevent the accumulation of surface
water.

F.
A. Calculation of the required volume of water.
§ 285-7 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 285-8
270:459
Determine the volume of water necessary to support the
household's daily needs using the following equation: Multiply the
number of bedrooms plus one times 110 gallons times two (the
safety factor) to equal total gallons needed. Example: 3 (bedrooms)
+ 1 x 110 (gallons) x 2 = 880 gallons.
(1)
To determine the volume of water necessary to support the daily
needs of non-dwelling buildings, use the following equation: From
the chart below determine water usage estimates for the type of
building. Multiply by a safety factor of two, which will equal total
gallons needed. Example: A three-chair barbershop at 100 gallons
per day per chair is 300 x 2 = 600 gallons of water needed daily.

Pumping test. The pumping test may be conducted at whatever rate is
desired, as long as the volume required for a twenty-four-hour period is
removed from the well. At one hour and again at 24 hours following the
pumping of the well, the water level must be measured and recorded.
If the water levels between the one- and twenty-four-hour levels are
not within one foot of each other, then a third water level measurement
will be taken after a second twenty-four-hour period. If the well fails
to yield the required volume within a twenty-four-hour period or if the
water in the well fails to recover, then the well should be redeveloped,
hydrofractured and/or deepened. After completing these procedures,
another pumping test must be conducted.
B.
A water quality test shall be conducted prior to the utilization of the
well for drinking water. The test, utilizing Environmental Protection
Agency approved methods for drinking water testing and not methods
used for analyzing wastewater, shall be conducted by a Massachusetts

Subdivision of land  See Ch. 270.
§ 290-1. Purpose.
§ 290-2. Policies.
These regulations or any portions thereof may be amended,
supplemented or repealed from time to time by the Board, with notice
as provided by law, on its own motion or by petition.
C.
The purpose of these regulations is to clarify and define the 1989
Belchertown Wetlands Protection Bylaw76 (hereafter referred to as the
"bylaw") administered by the Belchertown Conservation Commission
(hereafter "Commission"). The bylaw identifies and protects certain
wetland resource areas and the interests the general public has in
these areas. These regulations establish a uniform process by which the
Commission can review and regulate activities that affect the resource
areas and interests identified by the bylaw.
A.
In addition, the Commission wishes to provide clear guidance to
applicants regarding the policies that the Commission has determined
are necessary to protect wetland resource areas, based on
Belchertown's particular topography and hydrology, by the special
value these resource areas have to Belchertown and to neighboring
communities and by the Commission's past experience with wetlands
protection.
B.
No net loss policy. It is the policy of the Belchertown Conservation
Commission to follow the "no net loss" guidelines set forth by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. Therefore,
applicants who propose to alter resource areas under the Commission's
jurisdiction must:
(1) Demonstrate that there is no practicable alternative.
A.
76.Editor's Note: See Ch. 139, Wetlands Protection.
§ 285-18 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 290-2
270:466
(2) Minimize impacts where they are unavoidable.
Mitigate losses of wetland resource area, where applicable or
appropriate, on at least a 1:1 basis. Limited projects are included
in this requirement.
(3)
No net change in stormwater runoff. It is the policy of the Belchertown
Conservation Commission to require applicants to demonstrate that
no significant change in off-site runoff will result from proposed work.
Because increased runoff impacts land downstream and reduces
natural groundwater recharge, the Commission may require measures
(such as stormwater detention basins) to prevent increased runoff.
Direct discharge of runoff into a resource area will not be allowed.
B.
Resource areas.
The Conservation Commission has determined that certain
additional areas of jurisdiction are significant to the protection of
interests identified in the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw.
The Commission presumes that the following additional
resource areas are significant to those interests:
[1] Isolated wetlands greater than 5,000 square feet.
[2] Ponds greater than 5,000 square feet.
[3] Ephemeral pools.
(a)
These presumptions are rebuttable and may be overcome upon
a clear showing that said land does not play a role in the
protection of interests identified in the bylaw.
(b)
(1)
In addition, it is the policy of the Commission to advise applicants
on three nonregulated wetland resource areas:
(a) Intermittent streams upgradient of wetland resource areas.
Isolated land subject to flooding below 310 CMR 10.57 size
thresholds.
(b)
(c) Isolated wetlands less than 5,000 square feet.
(2)
The Commission will make every effort to identify these areas at
the site, will recommend locating them on the plans, will encourage
applicants to avoid impacts to these areas and will suggest possible
measures to mitigate unavoidable impacts with respect to drainage
and flood control.
(3)
C.
Vegetated buffer strip. Development proposed in the buffer zone can
negatively impact the abutting resource area(s). Negative impacts,
both from the construction and use phases of the project, can include
erosion, siltation, loss of pollution attenuation, loss of groundwater
recharge, reduced water quality and loss of wildlife habitat. A twenty-

The following are the values under the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw:
five-foot strip of continuous, undisturbed, indigenous vegetative cover
along the resource area boundary within the one-hundred-foot buffer
zone shall be maintained, where practicable, in order to protect water
quality, improve water recharge, reduce erosion and pollution to the
adjacent wetland resource areas and provide wildlife habitat.
Request for determination versus notice of intent. Many times
applicants are confused regarding when to file a request for
determination and when to file of a notice of intent for work in the
buffer zone. For a project to be issued a negative determination, the
Commission must be assured that the potential for alteration of a
resource area is so insignificant as to not require the oversight provided
by an order of conditions and subsequent certificate of compliance.
Therefore, the Commission may typically consider issuing a negative
determination to projects that meet the following minimum criteria:
(1) There is no alteration of a wetland resource area.
(2) There is less than 1,000 square feet of alteration in the buffer.
(3) No work will occur within 50 feet of a wetland resource area.
(4) Leach field of a septic system is 100 feet from resource area.
A plan is included for permanent stabilization, including loaming,
seeding and mulching.
(5)
Erosion-control measures are maintained until permanent
vegetation is established.
(6)
E.
A. Protection of public and private water supply.
B. Protection of groundwater and groundwater quality.
C. Protection of surface water and surface water quality.
D. Flood control.
E. Storm damage prevention.
F. Prevention of pollution.
G. Protection of fisheries.
H. Protection of wildlife habitat.
I. Erosion and sedimentation control.
J. Storm drainage.
K. Protection of agriculture.

§ 290-4. Areas of jurisdiction.
L. Protection of aquaculture.
M. Recreation.
Areas subject to jurisdiction under the local bylaw. Except as permitted
by the Conservation Commission or as provided for in the bylaw, no
person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon or alter the following
resource areas or within 100 feet of these resource areas, an area
known as the "buffer zone to the resource areas":
Any freshwater wetland as determined by vegetational community,
soil composition and/or hydrologic regime, including isolated
wetlands, and any marsh, wet meadow, bog or swamp.
(1)
(2) Any pond, lake, river and any perennial or intermittent stream.
(3) Any land under such waters.
(4) Any bank or beach.
Any land subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater, surface
water or storm flowage, including ephemeral pools, vernal pools
and kettle holes.
(5)
A.
Activities subject to regulation under the bylaw.
Activities within the resource areas. Any activity proposed or
undertaken within an area specified in Subsection A which, in the
judgment of the Commission, will remove, fill or alter an area
subject to protection under the bylaw is subject to regulation under
the bylaw and requires the filing of an application for permit
(§ 290-7D).
(1)
Activities within the buffer zone. Any activity proposed or
undertaken within 100 feet of an area specified in Subsection
A(1) through (5) (hereinafter called the "buffer zone") which, in
the judgment of the Commission, will alter an area subject to
protection under the bylaw is subject to regulation under the bylaw
and requires the filing of an application for permit.
(2)
Activities outside the areas subject to protection and the buffer
zone. See 310 CMR 10.02(c).
(3)
B.
Where natural vegetation is absent as a result of mowing, grazing or
other disturbance, the presence of hydric soils (soils that are annually
saturated, as evidenced by the observed groundwater, soil gleying or
soil mottling within 18 inches of the surface) shall provide positive
determination of jurisdiction. In cases where natural vegetation is
absent as a result of filling or draining, historic evidence and record
may provide positive determination of jurisdiction.

§ 290-5. General provisions.
Burden of proof and going forward. It is the applicant's responsibility
to note those requirements contained in these regulations which are in
addition to those set forth in 310 CMR 10.03.
A.
Incorporation. All of the procedures and requirements set forth in the
Wetlands Protection Regulations of 310 CMR 10.00 et seq. are hereby
incorporated and made a part of these regulations, except where they
differ from or depart from these regulations. Where these regulations
differ from the state regulations, they shall take precedence over the
state regulations. The applicant should first address the regulations at
310 CMR 10.00 et seq. and then supplement them with the Belchertown
Wetlands Regulations.
B.
Title V.
Preamble. The State Environmental Code (310 CMR 15.00 et seq.),
administered locally by the Belchertown Board of Health, is a
minimal public health regulation that may be supplemented at
the local level. Where they concern septic-derived contaminants,
the Belchertown Wetlands Regulations complement local health
regulations, which are independently authorized and administered.
(1)
Septic system location. Within the area of the Commission's
jurisdiction, a septic system is considered to be properly sited only
if all of the following conditions are met:
None of the septic components is located within a resource
area as defined in the Belchertown Wetland Bylaw [§ 290-4A(1)
through (5)]; and
(a)
Setback.
The leaching facility of a disposal system is set back at
least 100 feet from a resource area defined under the
bylaw, as required by local Board of Health regulations,
except:
The setback for areas which are defined as resource
areas only under the bylaw.
[a]
The setback required for the renovation, replacement
or maintenance of septic systems constructed prior
to the date of these regulations, provided that no
alternative location is available on the lot.
[b]
[1]
In these instances, if the proposed leaching facility setback
is greater than 50 feet and receives Belchertown Board
of Health approval, the Commission will presume that the
design meets requirements for effluent impacts, and the
Commission will only review construction impacts. If the
proposed leaching facility setback is less than 50 feet
[2]

C.
§ 290-5 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 290-5
270:470
§ 290-6. Definitions.
The definitions applicable to the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw shall be the
same as set forth in 310 CMR 10.00 et seq., except for the following
modifications to those definitions and additional definitions:
ALTER  To change the condition of any area subject to jurisdiction under
the bylaw. Examples of alterations include, but are not limited to, the
following:
from a resource area under these regulations, Commission
review will cover both effluent and construction impacts.
The setback distance is to be determined as specified in
310 CMR 10.03(3). The Commission shall determine the
edge of the resource area for the Board of Health upon
request.
[3]
Presumption concerning point source discharge. See 310 CMR
10.03(4).
D.
Presumption of significance. Each area subject to protection under the
Belchertown Wetlands Regulations is presumed to be significant to
one or more of the values identified in § 290-3. The presumptions are
rebuttable and are set forth in §§ 290-11 through 290-13.
E.
Presumption concerning application of herbicides. See 310 CMR
10.03(6).
F.
Fees. Fees shall be the same as 310 CMR 10.03(7), except that a
request for determination of applicability for any lot other than a singlefamily
lot, or for work on any lot other than a single-family lot, shall be
$50.
G.
Savings. Should any portion of these regulations be declared invalid by
a decision of the court, the legislature or other body having jurisdiction,
the remainder of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
H.
Reservation. These regulations should not be construed to limit the
authority under the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw. The Commission
reserves the right to act in a manner consistent with the bylaw upon
any matter within its jurisdiction.
I.
Effective date. The effective date of these regulations shall be January
1, 1992. These regulations apply to all applications made on or after the
effective date.
J.

BUFFER ZONE  That area of land extending 100 feet horizontally outward
from the boundary of any resource area described in § 290-4 of these
regulations.
EPHEMERAL POOL  An isolated depression or closed basin which
temporarily confines water during periods of high water table and high
input from spring runoff, snowmelt or heavy precipitation and serves as
vernal pool habitat. It is an essential breeding site for certain amphibians
which require isolated areas that are generally flooded for at least two
continuous months in the spring and/or summer and are free from fish
predators. Most of these amphibians remain near the breeding pool during
the remainder of the life cycle. Many reptiles, birds and mammals also feed
here.
ISOLATED WETLAND  An area of at least 5,000 square feet where
groundwater, flowing or standing surface water or ice supports a
community composed of at least 50% wetland plant species as included or
identified in generally accepted scientific technical publications.
POND  Any open body of freshwater, either naturally occurring or manmade
by impoundment, with a surface area observed or recorded within
the last 10 years of at least 5,000 square feet and which is never without
standing water due to natural causes, except during periods of extended
drought. For the purposes of this definition, "extended drought" shall mean
any period of four or more months during which the average rainfall for
each month is 50% or less of the ten-year average for that same month.
Basins or lagoons which are part of wastewater treatment plants shall not
be considered ponds, nor shall swimming pools or other impervious manmade
retention basins.
C. Drainage or other disturbance of water level or water table.
Dumping, discharging or filling with any material which may degrade
water quality.
D.
E. Placing of fill, or removal of material, which would alter elevations.
F. Driving of piles, erection or repair of buildings or structures of any kind.
G. Placing of obstructions or objects in water.
H. Destruction of plant life, including cutting of trees.
Changing water temperature, biochemical oxygen demand or other
physical, chemical or biological characteristics of surface and ground
water.
I.
Excavation for the purpose of percolation or deep hole testing or the
crossing of a resource area with heavy equipment for this purpose.
J.
Any activities, changes or work which may cause or tend to contribute
to pollution of water or groundwater.
K.
§ 290-6 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 290-6
270:472
PRACTICABLE ALTERNATIVE  A measure that is available and capable
of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology and
logistics in light of overall project purposes.
VEGETATED BUFFER STRIP  A continuous buffer strip, undisturbed and
in its natural state, between development activities in the buffer zone and
the resource area to be protected.
WATER-DEPENDENT USE  Those uses and facilities which require direct
access to, or location in, inland waters and which therefore cannot be
located away from those waters.
§ 290-7. Filing procedures.
The following procedures shall apply to all filings under the Belchertown
Wetlands Bylaw (unless specifically stated).
A. Time periods. See 310 CMR 10.05(1).
B. Actions by Conservation Commission. See 310 CMR 10.05(2).
Request for determination of applicability (RDA).
Explanation. Any person who desires a written determination as to
whether the bylaw applies to an area, or work to be performed in
an area, shall submit a written request to the Commission. This
request, called a "request for determination of applicability," shall
include a description of the area and/or work to be performed and
maps/plans as appropriate.

C.
§ 290-6 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-7
270:473
Filing procedure. It is the applicant's responsibility to provide all
of the information required for this review. The applicant must
complete the combination of filing form (Form A)77 and all
information on the request for determination.
Return the original and one copy by certified mail or hand
delivery to:
Belchertown Conservation Commission
Lawrence Memorial Town Hall
2 Jabish Street
Belchertown, MA 01007
(a)
Mail a copy to the landowner, when the applicant is not the
landowner, and:
DEP Western Regional Office
Division of Wetlands and Waterways Regulation
State House West, 4th Floor
436 Dwight Street
Springfield, MA 01103
(b)
Include an accurate description of the location (including
Assessor's Map and lot number), the boundaries of the
proposed work, all structures and the approximate distance
to wetlands, water bodies or other resource areas to be
protected.
(c)
When considering filing a request for determination for work in
the buffer zone, an applicant must assure the Commission that
the potential for alteration of a resource area is so insignificant
as not to require the oversight provided by an order of
conditions and subsequent certificate of compliance.
Therefore, the Commission may typically consider issuing
a negative determination when a project meets the
following minimum criteria:
[a] There is no alteration of a wetland resource area.
There is less than 1,000 square feet of alteration in the
buffer.
[b]
A fifty-foot undisturbed, vegetated buffer strip is left
between the proposed work and the resource area.

(d)
(2)
77.Editor's Note: Form A is available in the office of the Conservation Commission.
§ 290-7 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 290-7
270:474
There is less than five-percent slope toward the
resource area.
[d]
Leach field of a septic system is sited at least 100 feet
from any wetland resource area.
[e]
A plan for permanent stabilization is included:
loaming, seeding and mulching.
[f]
Erosion-control measures are maintained until
permanent vegetation is established.
[g]
Any activity not meeting these criteria must be filed under
a notice of intent filing. (See Subsection B.)
[2]
Public hearing. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
request for determination within 21 days of receipt of the request.
Public notice shall be provided in the Belchertown Sentinel or other
local paper at the applicant's expense. The Commission shall issue
a written determination within 21 days from receipt of the request.
Prior to making a determination, the Commission may require
the submission of additional data deemed pertinent to the
determination and shall inspect the property for which the
request was made. The Commission's determination shall be
issued on Form B78 and may be combined with a determination
made under the Wetlands Protection Act79 and sent to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.
(a)
Resource areas will be identified based on their definitions
as provided in these regulations. In cases where the natural
vegetative community has been disturbed by removal of the
vegetative cover, the Commission may determine the boundary
of a freshwater wetland based on the presence of hydric soils
or may defer determination of a wetland boundary until the
natural vegetation has regrown.
(b)
If a positive determination is issued, the applicant must file
an application for permit. A positive determination may be
issued to delineate the boundaries of a wetland when the area
is determined to be under jurisdiction and when the work
requires a permit.
(c)
If a negative determination is issued, it means that the area
is not subject to jurisdiction or that the work will not alter
an area subject to protection. In appropriate situations, the
Commission may require the recording of a negative
determination.
(d)

§ 290-7 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-7
270:475
If the application for a request for determination of
applicability is incomplete, the request must be resubmitted or
a positive determination will be issued due to lack of sufficient
information.
(e)
The Commission may defer action on a request when snow
cover makes the determination of resource area boundaries
unfeasible. Under these circumstances, the applicant will be
advised to request an extension, and the Commission shall
continue the public hearing and make a determination at the
first available opportunity. If the applicant refuses to request
an extension, upon majority vote of the Commission, a positive
determination may be issued.
(f)
Application for permit.
Explanation. The role of the Commission is that of a reviewing
agency. It is the applicant's responsibility to provide all of the
information required in the application for a permit necessary for
proper review. It is in the applicant's interest to submit as complete
and accurate a description of the project as possible to ensure that
requests for additional information do not result in an unnecessary
delay.
(1)
Filing procedure. An application for permit consists of the
completion of the combination filing form (Form A), completion of
a notice of intent form [310 CMR 10.05(4)] and/or completion of
Form C of the Belchertown Wetlands Regulations, depending upon
whether the resource area to be altered is under state jurisdiction
or only under local jurisdiction.80
An original and one copy of the application for permit and
accompanying plans and data shall be sent by mail or hand
delivered to:

Permit. Within 21 days of the close of the hearing, the Commission
will issue a permit/order of conditions with conditions to protect the
interests as identified under the bylaw. The written decision will be
signed by a majority of the Commission and shall be valid for three
years. Permits written under the Belchertown Wetlands Bylaw and
regulations may be on the same form as the state regulations or on
Form D, whichever may be appropriate.84 Permits shall be valid for
three years.
Conditions may be for the construction period (e.g., straw bales
for temporary erosion control) or may be in perpetuity (e.g.,
permanent buffer strips for erosion control, water supply
protection and wildlife habitat). Conditions may be structural (e.g.,
hay bale barrier for erosion control) or may require a specified
standard of performance (e.g., prevention of erosion).
Standard conditions. A standard set of conditions will be
imposed on all projects approved by the Commission. See
Appendix A.85
(a)
Special conditions. A special set of conditions will be imposed

Amended permits. If at any time after a permit has been issued
there is a change in the proposed activity, the applicant or owner
must notify the Commission, in writing, of the proposed changes
not less than 48 hours before a regularly scheduled meeting. No
work associated with these changes shall be conducted until the
Commission has reviewed the changes and issued a written
decision. The person making this request shall be notified by the
Commission of its decision within 21 days of the receipt of this
request. The Commission may determine that:
The changes represent a significant departure from the
original proposal and that the potential impacts of the new
proposal are sufficiently different from those of the original
proposal as to require the filing of a new application for permit.
(a)
The changes involve a moderate departure from the original
proposal and will require an amended permit. The Commission
shall publish newspaper notice (at the applicant's expense)
and make a decision on the request for an amended permit
after a public hearing. An amended permit must be filed at
the Registry of Deeds with a marginal reference to the original
permit. The following may require an amended permit:
[1] Decrease in the distance from the resource area.
[2] Increase in potential for erosion.
[3] Increase in size and change in location of structure.
[4] Increase in the amount of vegetation to be removed.
[5] Activity beyond the limit of work.
(b)
The changes represent an insignificant change in the original
proposal and will have no likelihood of greater impact on any
wetland resource area. The person proposing these changes
may proceed with work upon written notification by the
Commission.
(c)
(2)
Denials. If the Commission deems that the interests stated in the
bylaw are not adequately protected under the terms of the
applicant's proposal, the Commission may refuse to issue a permit.
When the Commission votes to deny a permit, it shall issue a
written decision.
(3)
Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the permit or decision of the
Conservation Commission, whether or not previously a party to the
proceeding, may appeal according to the Massachusetts General Laws.
G.
H. Extensions of permits. See 310 CMR 10.05(8).
Final release/certificate of compliance. Upon completion of the work
permitted, the applicant shall request, in writing, that the final release/
I.
§ 290-7 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-7
270:481
certificate of compliance be issued stating that the work has been
satisfactorily completed.
Upon written request by the applicant, a final release/certificate of
compliance may be issued within 21 days of receipt thereof and
shall certify that the activity or portions thereof described in the
application for permit and submitted plans have been completed in
compliance with the permit. The final release shall not be issued
until a site inspection is made by a member of the Commission and
shall be signed by a majority of the Commission. Final releases may
be combined with certificates of compliance issued under 310 CMR
10.05(6).
(1)
If the Commission determines, after review and inspection, that
the work has not been done in compliance with the permit, it may
refuse to issue a final release/certificate of compliance. A refusal
will be issued within 21 days of receipt of a request for a final
release, will be in writing and will specify the reasons for denial.
(2)
If the final permit contains conditions which continue past the
completion of the work, such as maintenance or monitoring, the
final release/certificate of compliance shall specify which, if any, of
such conditions shall continue.
(3)
The final release will be recorded in the Registry of Deeds or
Land Court. Certification of the recording shall be sent to the
Commission. Upon failure of the applicant to so record, the
Commission may do so.
(4)

Freshwater wetlands. Freshwater wetlands include bordering
vegetated wetlands, such as marshes, wet meadows, bogs and swamps,
as defined in 310 CMR 10.55 and incorporated into these regulations
as Subsection F of this section. They are areas of wetland vegetation
where 50% or more of the vegetative community consists of obligate or
faculative wetland plant species as included or identified in generally
accepted scientific or technical publications. Freshwater wetlands also
include isolated wetlands greater than 5,000 square feet in area.

Isolated wetlands.
Preamble. Isolated wetlands are freshwater wetlands that do not
border on creeks, rivers, streams, ponds and lakes. Isolated
wetlands are likely to be significant to public or private water
supply, groundwater supply, flood control, storm damage
prevention, prevention of pollution and the protection of wildlife
habitat.
Isolated wetlands may be found either in areas with low, flat
topography or below sidehill seeps. These areas provide
temporary storage of water resulting from runoff, rising
groundwater or where groundwater breaks out of a slope
forming a sidehill seep, thereby providing for flood control and
prevention of flood damage. Alteration can result in the lateral
displacement of retained water into adjacent properties,
resulting in modified drainage patterns with the potential for
property damage.
(a)
Isolated wetlands are areas where groundwater may discharge
to the surface either by a rising water table or from a sidehill
seep. Under some circumstances, surface water may discharge
(b)
(1)
G.
§ 290-11 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-11
270:485
to the groundwater in these areas, particularly where they
are underlain by pervious materials. Contaminants introduced
into such areas, such as septic system discharges, road salts,
pesticides or herbicide, find easy access into the groundwater
and may contaminate private or public water supplies.
Where such areas are underlain by pervious material covered
by a mat of organic peat or muck, they are likely to be
significant to prevention of pollution.
(c)
Isolated wetlands may provide important habitat for wildlife.
Isolated wetlands providing seasonal wetland habitats are
essential breeding sites for certain amphibians which require
isolated areas that generally flood in the spring and/or summer
and are free of fish predators. Many reptiles, birds and
mammals depend upon such isolated wetlands as a source of
food.
(d)
Definition, critical characteristics and boundary. Isolated wetlands
are freshwater wetlands as defined in these regulations that do
not border on creeks, rivers, streams, ponds and lakes. Isolated
wetlands may occur in a depression or closed basin in otherwise
flat topography. In these areas, water may pool above the surface at
least once a year or may be contained in the top 18 inches of soil. In
addition, some isolated wetlands occur downslope of sidehill seeps,
depending on the topography, soils and water regime.
Isolated wetlands are areas of wetland vegetation where at
least 50% or more of the natural vegetative community must
consist of plants listed in the Massachusetts Wetlands
Protection Act or which are obligate or facultative wetland
plant species as included or identified in generally accepted
scientific or technical publications; and

Presumption. Where a proposed activity involves filling, dredging
or altering of an isolated wetland, the Commission shall presume
that such an area is significant to the interests specified in the

role in said interests. In the event that the presumption is deemed
to have been overcome, the Commission shall make a written
determination to this effect, setting forth its grounds.

Preamble.
Ephemeral pools are usually isolated depressions or closed basins
that serve, in most years, as ponding areas for runoff or high
groundwater that has risen to the surface. Ephemeral pools are, by
definition, of seasonal duration; accordingly, the degree of wetness
necessary for the establishment of a typical wetland plant
community does not exist in most cases. Since the temporary
nature of ephemeral pools precludes the presence of fish species,
these areas are able to support viable populations of several
amphibian and invertebrate species which are highly vulnerable
to fish predation. The presence of a sustaining population of any
(1)
A.
§ 290-11 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-12
270:487
species of fish at a site in question would rule it out as an
ephemeral pool.
Ephemeral pools are not located within resource areas under
jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act but serve
as vernal pool habitat. Where one of these ponded areas is shown
to be vernal pool habitat, it shall be considered an ephemeral pool
under these regulations and presumed significant to the protection
of wildlife habitat.
(2)
Definition, critical characteristics and boundary.
Definition. Ephemeral pools are isolated depressions or closed
basins which temporarily confine water during periods of high
water table and high input from spring runoff, snowmelt or heavy
precipitation and serve as vernal pool habitat. They are essential
breeding sites for certain amphibians which require isolated areas
that are generally flooded for at least two continuous months in
the spring and/or summer and are free from fish predators. Most
of these amphibians remain near the breeding pool during the
remainder of their life cycle. Many reptiles, birds and mammals
also feed here.
(1)
Critical characteristics.
Temporality. Ephemeral pools generally fill up during the
spring rains and snowmelt, dry up during the summer and
may fill again during the fall rains or during summer
thundershowers. An area where water stands on a year-round
basis will not be considered to be a temporary wetland (it may
be an isolated wetland). The cycle of filling and drying may
occasionally miss a year due to dry conditions.
(a)
Isolated depressions. Shallow areas of no minimum size where
water ponds in response to flooding, high groundwater or
inputs from rain and snow meltwater and which lack
permanent inlets or outlets.
(b)
Organic accumulation. The presence of a well-developed
organic layer is a feature of most ephemeral pools. These pools
have generally existed since the end of the glacial period and
will probably continue in their semi-open condition for many
more thousands of years unless artificially altered. These pools
act as traps for organic matter, especially during the autumn
when they trap quantities of airborne leaves. The presence of
water-stained leaves in a depression which is otherwise dry is
a good indicator that the area temporarily serves to pool water.
(c)
(2)
Boundary. Because ephemeral pools are dry much of the year, it
may be necessary to determine their boundaries using indicators
other than pooled water. Further, because the area inundated
varies so widely from year to year, pooled water is not a good
(3)
B.
§ 290-12 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 290-12
270:488
§ 290-13. Buffer zone.
indicator of extent. An ephemeral pool boundary shall be
determined using a combination of pooled water, if present, and the
presence of a depression covered by water-soaked leaves, water
marks or lack of moss on trees, buttressed tree trunks, shallowrooted
trees or adventitious roots on trees. Other indicators of the
temporary pooling of water, such as the presence of caddis fly cases
or fingernail or pea clams, can also be used. The burden of proof for
identification of an ephemeral pool shall be upon the Conservation
Commission. Identification must be made prior to the close of
a public hearing and shall follow the guidelines for vernal pool
certification criteria established by the Massachusetts Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife. In the case of disputes, hydrological
calculations using the two-year storm may be used to provide a
determination of the boundary of an ephemeral pool.
Presumption. Where a proposed activity involves the removing, filling,
dredging or altering of an ephemeral pool, the Conservation
Commission shall presume that such an area is significant to the
protection of wildlife habitat, particularly amphibian breeding habitat.
This presumption is rebuttable and may be overcome upon a clear
showing that the ephemeral pool does not play a role in the protection
of wildlife habitat. In the event that the presumption is deemed to have
been overcome, the Commission shall make a written determination to
this effect, setting forth its grounds.
C.
General performance standards. A proposed project in a ephemeral
pool shall not result in the following:
Any impairment of the capacity of the ephemeral pool, as well
as the area within 100 feet of the mean annual boundary of the
ephemeral pool, to provide wildlife habitat. Alterations may be
permitted if they will have no adverse effects on wildlife habitat, as
determined by the procedures listed in 310 CMR 10.60.
(1)
Endangering state-listed species, which shall be protected under
the procedures listed in 310 CMR 10.59.
(2)
D.
Preamble. It is the Commission's experience that any project
undertaken in close proximity to a wetland resource area has a high
likelihood of resulting in some alteration of that area, either
immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over a longer period
of time, as a consequence of daily operation of the completed project.
These negative impacts from construction, as well as long-term use,
in the buffer zone can include erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater
recharge, poor water quality characteristics and loss of wildlife habitat.
The Commission's prime concern in the buffer zone is the ultimate
impact on the adjacent wetland resource area from both the
construction and use phases of the proposed activity. The policy of the
Commission is to have the applicant maintain a strip of continuous,
A.
§ 290-12 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 290-13
270:489
undisturbed, indigenous vegetative cover in the buffer zone adjacent
to the resource area to reduce erosion and pollution to the adjacent
wetland resource area, maintain water quality, improve water recharge
and provide wildlife habitat.
Definition and critical characteristics.
Definition. The buffer zone is that area of land extending 100
feet horizontally outward from the boundary of any resource area
specified in § 290-4A.
(1)
Critical characteristics.
Where surface runoff or groundwater from the buffer zone
drains toward the resource area, vegetative cover and soils
may filter runoff and provide uptake or renovation of pollutants
from adjacent areas, thereby protecting water quality within
the resource area. The vegetation and soils may slow surface
runoff and permit infiltration of precipitation, maintaining the
hydrologic regime to which the resource area is adapted.
(a)
Indigenous vegetation is often used by wildlife for important
functions, such as nesting, feeding and protective cover sites.
Dense understory in wooded areas may provide nesting sites,
travel corridors and protective cover for a wide variety of
fauna. Cutting of vegetation, especially canopy trees, alters
the physical environment by allowing more light and air and
may increase temperatures during the summer and decrease
temperatures in winter.
(b)
(2)
B.
Presumption. A continuous twenty-five-foot vegetated buffer strip
between development activities in the buffer zone and the resource
area to be protected shall be presumed to be significant to the interests
specified in the preamble above. This is rebuttable and may be
overcome upon a clear showing that said land will not play a role in
the protection of said interests. In the event that the presumption is
deemed to have been overcome, the issuing authority shall make a
written determination to this effect, setting forth the grounds.
The following activities within the twenty-five-foot buffer strip shall
be presumed not to be significant to interests specified in the
preamble above:
Ongoing landscaping activities on existing developed lots
(continued mowing, landscaped plantings and selective
pruning), provided that soil is not exposed to erosion, there
is no change in grade and sod cover or natural litter layer is
maintained.
(a)
Construction or installation of fences or structures not
requiring a building permit.

§ 294-1. Findings.
(c) Construction of footpaths of minimum size.
Water-dependent activities, limited projects approved by the
Commission and activities where there is no practicable alternative
may be allowed by the Commission where impacts are minimized
and mitigated, as necessary. As with any work in the buffer zone,
these activities still require the filing of a request for determination
of applicability or notice of intent, whichever is appropriate under
these regulations.
(2)
Performance standards.
Any work within the buffer zone shall not result in alteration of
any resource area, or, if work within the buffer zone which alters
a resource area is permitted by the Commission, the alteration of
the resource area shall comply with the applicable performance
requirements for the altered resource area and any other
conditions the Commission may require to enforce those
performance requirements.
(1)
Unless as specified above, a continuous twenty-five-foot nodisturbance
buffer strip, untouched and in its natural state, shall
be left between development activities in the buffer zone and the
resource area to be protected.
(2)
Any drainage outletting in the buffer zone shall be shown to be
nonerosive and shall demonstrate that there is no significant
change in off-site runoff from the proposed work.

D.
Whereas; The Belchertown Board of Heath does hereby find that:
Outdoor wood-fired boilers/furnaces (OWB/F) have been demonstrated
to emit dense wood smoke and therefore pose a potential threat to the
health and welfare of persons living in proximity of these devices as
well as the community at large, by affecting the quality of both indoor
and outdoor environments. The relative composition of large quantities
of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) presents the most serious health
threat. Scientific studies have demonstrated relationships between fine
particulate matter and certain health problems, including asthma and
chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function and shortness of breath,
and other acute respiratory problems, including coughing and chest
tightness. Other public health threats include the exposure to other
toxic chemicals, including air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides, irritants toxic to respiratory cilia such as phenols,
cresols, scrolein and acetaldehyde, carcinogenic volatile organics
(volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, formaldehyde

By the authority granted to the Board of Health, pursuant to and in
accordance with, MGL c. 111, §§ 31, 31C and 122, the Belchertown Board
of Health hereby enacts the following regulations.
§ 294-3. Applicability.
These regulations shall apply to each OWB/F installed on or after October
1, 2007. In addition, any existing OWB/F installed and/or in use prior to the
effective date of these regulations have until January 1, 2008, to come into
compliance with these regulations.
§ 294-4. Definitions.
OUTDOOR WOOD-FIRED BOILER  A wood-fired boiler surrounded by a
water jacket, in an insulated freestanding shed with a smoke stack and
used to heat water that is carried by underground pipes to provide heat to
a building. This definition does not include industrial-sized furnace/boiler
plants regulated and permitted by the MA Department of Environmental
Protection and which utilized best available control technology (BACT) for
emission control.
OUTDOOR WOOD-FIRED FURNACE  An accessory structure or appliance
designed to be located outside space ordinarily used for residential,
business or industrial purposes which is designed to provide heat, via
liquid or other means, through the burning of wood, for heating spaces
other than where such structure or appliance is located, or for heating
domestic, swimming pool, hot tub or Jacuzzi water. "Outdoor wood-burning
furnace" does not include a fire pit, wood-fired barbecue or chimney. This
definition does not include industrial-sized furnace/boiler plants regulated
and permitted by the MA Department of Environmental Protection and
which utilized best available control technology (BACT) for emission
control.
and 1, 3 butadiene, carcinogenic cyclic compounds such as
polyaromatic hydrocarbon.
Whereas; The Belchertown Board of Heath does hereby find that: The
firing and general operation of OWB/F produces smoke often with an
opacity in excess of that allowed by 310 CMR 7.06(1) (20%, two minutes
during one hour/40% at any time) and therefore significantly contribute
to the development of nuisance conditions.
B.
Accordingly, the BOH finds and declares that the purpose of this
regulation is to protect the public health and welfare by assuring the
optimal siting and operation of these devices and the education of
owner-operators in techniques to minimize the production of noxious
wood smoke.
C.
§ 294-1 BELCHERTOWN CODE § 294-4
270:492
SEASON WOOD  Wood that has been cut a year and dried at least six
months, or by other means, to achieve moisture content (MC) less than 20%
by weight.
WOOD FUEL  All wood intended to be used as fuel, including but not
limited to trees, cordwood, logs, lumber, sawdust, and wood from
manufacturing processes (butt offs, shavings, turnings, sander dust), wood
pellets, slabs, clean and untreated pallets. This definition does not include
materials chemically treated with any preservative such as paint, oil-base
product or pressure treated, trash or garbage, paper products, or
demolition material.
§ 294-5. Regulations.
A permit is required from the Board of Health to use an OWB/F in the
Town of Belchertown.
A.
Any person desiring to install an OWB/F on or after October 1, 2007,
shall apply for a permit from the Board of Health prior to applying for
and/or obtaining a permit from the Department of Inspection Services
to install and/or use of such OWB/F in the Town of Belchertown. The
Board of Health permit process shall include submission of a written
application form and payment of the permit fee established by the
Board of Health. The application must be accompanied by a site plan
prepared by a professional land surveyor or professional engineer
indicating the proposed OWB/F location, property identification by tax
map and parcel, property lines, acreage and zone designation of the
parcel to be served by the OWB/F, separation distances between the
OWB/F and all buildings and outbuildings on the site of the OWB and
all neighboring houses within 500 feet, as well as elevations of the
proposed chimney height, and the peaks of all buildings within 500
feet of the proposed OWB/F, together with identification of all roads
adjacent to the site, and the distance from the OWB to wooded areas,
brush, and flammable structures. Because the provision regarding
chimney heights is intended to limit the envelopment of downwind
residences by the smoke plume from an outdoor wood-fired boiler/
furnace, the comparative heights must be referenced to mean sea level
(MSL) or by an identified, permanent bench mark established on the
property.
B.
Any person using an OWB/F prior to the effective date of this regulation
may continue to use said OWB/F until January 1, 2008. No later than
October 1, 2007, any person using an OWB/F prior to the effective date
of this regulation shall apply for a permit from the Board of Health to
continue using said OWB/F after January 1, 2008. Said application shall
be submitted in accordance with the process set forth in Subsection
B above and shall demonstrate compliance with all sections of these
regulations.
C.
After the effective date of these regulations, no person shall use, install,
allow the installation, or acquire through property transfer, an outdoor

boiler/furnace that has become inoperable) in the Town of Belchertown,
nor shall permits be sought from or issued by the Department of
Inspection Services for the installation or substantial modification of an
outdoor wood-fired boiler/furnace unless in full accordance with all of
the following provisions:
The outdoor wood-fired boiler/furnace shall be installed and used
only in areas of Belchertown zoned Ag-A and Ag-B as delineated on
the most current Town of Belchertown Zoning Map.
(1)
The OWB/F shall meet EPA Phase I emission standards certified to
meet a particulate matter emission limit of 0.60 pounds per million
British thermal units (lb/MMBtu).
(2)
The facility served by the outdoor wood-fired boiler/furnace shall
be located on a parcel of at least four acres in size, and
(3)
The outdoor wood-fired boiler/furnace shall be located at least 200
feet from the nearest property line and structure other than that
served by the OWB/F, and
(4)
Has an attached permanent stack extending at least two feet
higher than the peak of the roof of the structure(s) being served by
the OWB, and any residence located within 500 feet from the OWB/
F, provided the chimney height is not more than 55 feet.
(5)
The owner and the operator of the OWB/F has 1.) Successfully
passed an examination administered by the Belchertown Board
of Health on proper wood-burning practices, and 2.) Signed an
acknowledgement that outdoor wood-fired boilers furnaces, even
if operated in accordance with these regulations, may still create
nuisance conditions or violate existing visible smoke regulations
and therefore may be subject to private nuisance action and/or
local or state enforcement action.
(6)
Outdoor wood-fired boilers/furnaces shall be operated only between
September 15 and April 30.
E.
Only dry (moisture content of less than 20%), seasoned, untreated wood
fuel as defined above may be burned in the outdoor wood-fired boiler/
furnace. Under no circumstances may any starter chemical such as
gasoline be used in the outdoor wood-burning boiler/furnace.
F.
No person shall operate an outdoor wood-fired boiler/furnace in any
manner which causes a nuisance by interfering with the use and
