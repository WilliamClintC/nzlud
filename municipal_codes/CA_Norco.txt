The City Council of the City of Norco intends to secure compliance with the provisions of this Code. To the extent that such compliance may be achieved by less drastic methods of enforcement the following alternate, separate and distinct methods may be utilized. Each method set forth herein is intended to be mutually exclusive and does not prevent concurrent or consecutive methods being used to achieve compliance against continuing violations. Each and every day any such violations exist constitutes a separate offense. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, each violation of the provisions of this Code may be enforced alternatively as follows:

A.    Infraction—General. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this Code may be prosecuted for an infraction. Written citations for infractions may be issued by police officers or nonsafety employees designated by Section 1.05.020. Except for violations pertaining to construction on multiple-unit residential or commercial or industrial projects, an infraction under the provisions of this Code shall be punishable either by fines as is specified in the currently adopted Uniform Infraction Bail Schedule used by the Riverside County Consolidated Courts, or where no fine is specified therein by:

1.    A fine not exceeding $100.00 for a first violation;

2.    A fine not exceeding $250.00 for a second violation of the same ordinance within three years.

Infraction—Construction. For violations of this Code pertaining to construction on residential development projects that consist of more than one housing unit, or construction of commercial or industrial projects, including, but not limited to, hours of construction activity, storm water runoff and discharge controls, grading, etc., shall be assessed in the amounts specified in this chapter, as adopted by the City Council, as:

1.    A fine not exceeding $5,000 for a first violation;

2.    A fine not exceeding $10,000 for a second violation within three years from the date of the first violation;

3.    A fine not exceeding $25,000 for each additional violation within three years from the date of the first violation.

All work shall be stopped on the subject of the violation, and the building(s) red-tagged, until the amount of the applicable fine has been deposited with the City as a bail amount. The prosecution of alleged violations of this section shall be processed utilizing the administrative citation procedure as set forth in Chapter 1.05.

B.    Misdemeanor. Any person violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this Code may be prosecuted for a misdemeanor. Written citations for misdemeanors may be issued by police officers or by nonsafety employees designated by Norco Municipal Code Section 1.05.020. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

C.    Civil Action. The City Attorney, by and at the request of the City Council, may institute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain, enjoin or abate the condition(s) found to be in violation of the provisions of this Code, as provided by law.

D.    Administrative Citation. Upon a finding by the City official vested with the authority to enforce the various provisions of this Code that a violation exists, he or she may issue an Administrative Citation under the provisions of Chapter 1.05.

E.    In addition to the penalties provided in this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code is a public nuisance and may be, by this City, abated as such. Each day such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

F.    Recovery of Attorneys’ Fees Authorized for Certain Nuisances Upon Election by City. In any action, administrative proceeding or special proceeding commenced by the City to abate a public nuisance, if the City elects at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding to seek recovery of its own attorneys’ fees and costs, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees. In no action, administrative proceeding or special proceeding shall an award of attorneys’ fees and costs to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees and actual costs incurred by the City in the action or proceeding.

G.    Prevailing Party. In addition to any other determination of prevailing party authorized pursuant to applicable law, the City shall be considered a prevailing party entitled to its costs under subsection (A) of this section when it can demonstrate that:

1.    Its lawsuit was the catalyst motivating the defendant to provide the primary relief sought;

2.    The lawsuit was meritorious and achieved its result by “threat of victory”; and

3.    The City reasonably attempted to settle the litigation before filing the lawsuit.

H.    Remedies Cumulative. The remedies contained in this section are cumulative to one another and to any other remedy available by law or in equity to the City.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A.    To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the City to adopt the tax ordinance codified in this chapter which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B.    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C.    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes.

D.    To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and, at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1041 Sec. 2, 2018)

3.05.020 Contract with State.
Prior to the operative date, the City shall contract with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of the transactions and use tax ordinance codified in this chapter; provided, that if the City shall not have contracted with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract. (Ord. 1041 Sec. 2, 2018)

3.05.030 Transactions tax rate.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the City at the rate of one percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 1041 Sec. 2, 2018)

(1)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

(2)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

(3)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;

(4)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 3 Sec. 4, 1964)

3.08.050 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State Sales and Use Tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

As soon as the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable 15 days after said written notice is given unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.36.100.

An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Deputy City Manager/Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C.

A.    The City is a member agency of the Western Riverside Council of Governments (“WRCOG”), a joint powers agency comprised of the County of Riverside and 18 cities located in Western Riverside County. Acting in concert, the WRCOG member agencies developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in Western Riverside County (the “regional system”) could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee (“TUMF”) on future residential, commercial and industrial development.

B.    WRCOG, upon the recommendation of the WRCOG Executive Committee, now desires to adopt a process in which WRCOG calculates and collects TUMF on behalf of member agencies under the Western Riverside County Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee Program Ordinance of 2018.

C.    The findings set forth in Ordinance No. 1025 remain true and correct, and by this reference are incorporated into the ordinance codified in this chapter, Ordinance No. 1044, as if set forth in full herein. The ordinance codified in this chapter, Ordinance No. 1044, shall amend and supersede the provisions of Ordinance No. 1025, and to the extent any provisions herein conflict with any provisions of Ordinance No. 1044 or any other ordinance of the City, the City Council finds and determines that it is the intent of the City Council that the provisions herein shall control.

Furthermore, the TUMF Administrator shall use the Fee Calculation Handbook adopted July 14, 2003, as amended from time to time, for the purpose of calculating a developer’s TUMF obligation. In addition to detailing the methodology for calculating all TUMF obligations of different categories of new development, the purpose of the Fee Calculation Handbook is to clarify for the TUMF Administrator, where necessary, the definition and calculation methodology for uses not clearly defined in the respective TUMF ordinances.

WRCOG shall expend only that amount of the funds generated from the TUMF for staff support, audit, administrative expenses, and contract services that are necessary and reasonable to carry out its responsibilities and in no case shall the funds expended for salaries and benefits exceed one percent of the revenue raised by the TUMF program. The TUMF administrative plan further outlines the fiscal responsibilities and limitations of the Administrator.

3.50.070 Effect.
No provisions of this chapter shall entitle any person who has already paid the TUMF to receive a refund, credit or reimbursement of such payment. This chapter does not create any new TUMF. (Ord. 1044 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1025 Sec. 1, 2017)

3.50.080 No procedural defenses.
Jurisdictions shall be prohibited from raising procedural defenses, including without limitation a statute of limitations, laches, the California Government Tort Claims Act, and necessary parties in a dispute with WRCOG regarding the matters set forth herein.

The program ensures proper use and application of City of Norco trademarks, to strengthen relationships with retailers, licensees, community organizations, and residents, and to generate revenue that funds community promotion initiatives and programs. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.020 Administration of chapter.
The City of Norco hereby establishes a trademark and licensing program. The City of Norco hereby reserves all rights and privileges to City trademarks as outlined and approved by the Norco City Council.

A.    The City Manager is responsible for management and administration of the provisions relating to all City trademarks including:

1.    The supervision of the use of trademarks;

2.    The design, issuance, and control of trademarks;

3.    The enforcement of Sections 3.70.090 and 3.70.100.

B.    The City Council shall establish forms and fees for the applications and agreements to be used or issued for use of City trademarks under this chapter.

C.    The City of Norco is responsible for maintaining the rights and privileges associated with the trademark and licensing program. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.030 Custody of trademarks.
The City Clerk shall have official custody of official trademarks of the City. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.040 Definitions.
A.    Trademark. As defined by the United States Patents and Trademarks Office, “a trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others.”

B.    “Licensee” means a person or an organization that has been granted the legal right by the City of Norco, under a trademark license, to use the City’s trademark(s). Anyone or any business/organization wishing to use the City’s trademarks on any product must have a license before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

C.    “Trademark license” means a written legal agreement between the owner of the trademark (licensor) and a retailer/manufacturer/vendor (licensee). The licensor grants permission to the licensee to affix the licensor’s trademark(s) on a product(s). This license must be in place before any products with a City trademark are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.050 Types of license agreements.
Any person, business, or organization desiring to use a City trademark in any manner and for any purpose must be licensed to do so. Before an individual or business may use the City of Norco’s trademarks, formal permission must be granted by the City of Norco through a license agreement before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed. There are several types of licensing agreements to accommodate different licensee needs.

A.    One-Time Use License. A one-time use license is for individuals, businesses or organizations that wish to use a City trademark on a custom-made product. The product must be customized and cannot be purchased from an existing licensee. The specific product will be manufactured only once for personal, noncommercial use by one member of the Norco community and will not be resold. Approval to use a trademark for a one-time application only does not constitute approval to use the trademark again, or in connection with any other item, or to change the design in any way. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

Example of a one-time use licensee: a community organization that requests to order a single product (i.e., a flag) for a community event, a local business that requests to order one item (i.e., window sticker, monument sign) to show community pride on its storefront, etc.

B.    Crafter License. The crafter license is for use of City trademarks on domestic handcrafted items sold to individual consumers via events or direct sales. The crafter license is designed to provide small, home-based entrepreneurs with an opportunity to partner their creativity with the brand recognition of the City of Norco in creating unique items incorporating City trademarks. Under a crafter license, anticipated sales may not exceed 100 units or sales revenue may not exceed $2,500 in one contract year, whichever is lower. A crafter license allows for sales to individual consumers only, not via wholesale or a third party retailer. Items must be handmade, as no commercially manufactured items are permitted under this license. Sales may only be conducted through retail stores located in the City of Norco. The crafter license is annually renewable as long as products, designs and distribution plans do not change. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

Example of a crafter licensee: an individual producing domestic handcrafted items in the home with City trademarks and selling/distributing to individual consumers via events or direct sales, such as craft fairs, holiday events, street festivals, farmers markets or local retailers.

C.    Local License. The local license is for production of emblematic merchandise to be sold strictly by a local individual or company located in the City of Norco and for community pride or decor inside local businesses. The local license is annually renewable as long as products, designs and distribution plans do not change. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

Example of local licensee: retailer/manufacturer located in the City of Norco with a valid City business license that requests to mass produce approved commercial item(s) (i.e., stickers) and distribute/sell through channels within the City of Norco; local business that requests to display a salable product on/in a separate (nonsalable) item that bears a City trademark (i.e., glassware that is used to serve beverages; however, the glassware is not actually for sale), etc.

D.    Standard License. The standard license is for production of emblematic merchandise to be resold through various retail distribution channels, such as items for sale in local, regional and national retail outlets. This license is intended for companies that are capable of extensive production and retail distribution of their products. The standard license is annually renewable as long as products, designs and distribution plans do not change. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

Example of standard licensee: retailer/manufacturer outside of the City of Norco that requests to mass produce approved commercial item(s) (i.e., stickers) and distribute/sell across multiple distribution channels outside of the City of Norco.

E.    Partnership License. The partnership license is for the use of City trademarks by a third party to promote or advertise that party’s business (commercial or charitable) in a way that directly implies association with the City of Norco. A partnership license is granted to entities with official sponsorship relationships with the City and is limited to initiatives, materials, events or other community activities that are co-sponsored (i.e., monetarily) by the City of Norco. The partnership license is annually renewable contingent upon (1) a formal sponsorship/partnership agreement with the City of Norco and (2) products, designs and distribution plans do not change. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed.

Example of a partnership licensee: a local community organization promoting its legitimate agreement/partnership with the City of Norco by including a City trademark on event or program promotional/informational materials.

F.    Promotional License. The promotional license is for companies or manufacturers that wish to produce products used as promotional items. A product bearing a City trademark is considered a promotional item when it is used to increase the sales of another product, increase a company’s brand recognition or further a company’s association with the City without a formal partnership/sponsorship agreement. Promotional items are not commercial products, as they are not directly sold for profit. The promotional license is annually renewable as long as products, designs and distribution plans do not change. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed. Promotional items may or may not be co-branded and include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.    Products being given away in conjunction with a consumer promotion;

2.    Products co-branded with corporate and City trademarks;

3.    Products used as rewards/gifts;

4.    Products used as dealer loaders.

Example of a promotional licensee: a business using a City trademark solely to bring attention to a product, product display or service to increase sales, but not to sell the actual item bearing a City trademark. This could include a realtor’s advertising, open house signage or promotional materials; a vehicle with a corporate logo and a City trademark; free giveaway items bearing a City trademark and a corporate logo, etc. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.060 Insurance requirements.
Licensees are required to carry minimum $1,000,000 general liability insurance per incident and to list the City of Norco as an additional insured. The licensee is required to bear all risk in respect of the articles and hold the City of Norco harmless. The City reserves the right, for cases in which the trademark is applied to potentially dangerous merchandise (e.g., steak knives, flotation devices), to require the licensee to obtain an additional product liability insurance policy, with a minimum coverage of $1,000,000 per incident. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.070 Licensing terms and renewal.
The City Manager’s office may extend the term of agreement in writing for two additional one-year terms or such other term not to exceed two years from the date of termination pursuant to the same terms and conditions of this agreement. At time of renewal, the licensee must submit a new application but will not be required to pay the nonrefundable application fee as long as there are no changes to the products, designs, materials or distribution plans listed in the original application. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.080 Licensing process.
The process to obtain a license is separated into three phases:

A.    Phase I. Applicants will be required to:

1.    Complete the trademark license application (Exhibit G, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter), including a product information form for each requested product the applicant wishes to license;

2.    Provide a sample for review showing how the City of Norco trademark would appear on the requested product if the application were approved;

3.    Pay the nonrefundable application fee;

4.    Provide an example of how the applicant’s name will be applied to product (company label);

5.    Review insurance information and obtain a quote from an agent/carrier.

The City Manager’s office will thoroughly evaluate the application to either approve or deny the request. Upon approval, the City Manager’s office will determine the license type the applicant best qualifies under.

Any applicant that is aggrieved by the decision of the City Manager’s office may make a written appeal to the City Manager within 14 days of the decision. After conducting an administrative appeal hearing, the City Manager shall make a decision which shall be final.

B.    Phase II. Approved applicants will be required to:

1.    Obtain and provide proof of insurance;

2.    Submit final product designs.

C.    Phase III. Approved applicants will be required to:

1.    Review and sign the license agreement;

2.    Pay annual fee.

The City will then deliver trademarked image(s) and “Officially Licensed City of Norco Trademark Product” certificate to licensee. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.090 Use of trademarks.
The City of Norco reserves the right to disapprove any use of its trademarks, even if such use is not explicitly prohibited by this policy or these guidelines. In instances where there is uncertainty regarding the appropriate use of any City trademarks, the City Manager will consult with the City Attorney.

A.    Sole Ownership/Copyright. No one other than the City of Norco may claim copyright or trademark rights in or seek to register any design that uses City trademarks.

B.    Approvals. Each use of a City of Norco trademark requires approval. The licensee, as well as all products and designs, must be preapproved before any products are manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed. The licensee must provide a sample for review showing how the City of Norco trademark would appear on the requested product before the product is manufactured, sold, distributed or marketed. Approval to use a trademark in one capacity does not constitute approval to use the trademark again, or in connection with any other item, or to change the design in any way.

C.    No Alterations. To maintain brand integrity and to ensure current and future protections under State and Federal trademark law, City of Norco trademarks may not be altered in any way, including color, proportions, spelling, punctuation, etc., without the express written approval of the City Manager’s office. Altering a mark would dilute the integrity, strength and value of the mark. Products produced with altered logos, where the express permission of the City of Norco was not provided, may be considered counterfeit and subject to all available legal remedies, including the seizure of products. City trademarks are the intellectual property of the City of Norco and must be properly maintained (i.e., cannot appear damaged or low quality).

D.    Co-Branding. City of Norco trademarks may not be used in conjunction with the name or trademark(s) of any other entity without the prior written permission of that entity. If permission is granted by the City Manager’s office to use both City trademark and another party’s trademark in a design, the trademarks must be distinct and separate from each other, and the City’s trademarks must not be overshadowed or diminished in any way in comparison to the other entity’s trademark. Approval of any such dual use of City trademarks will be limited to instances where there is a compelling institutional priority in allowing such a use.

E.    No Endorsement. City of Norco trademarks may not be used in any manner that suggests or implies the City’s endorsement of other organizations, companies, products, services, political parties or views, or religious organizations or beliefs.

F.    Nondiscrimination. City of Norco trademarks may not be used in any way that discriminates or implies discrimination against any persons or groups based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, citizenship, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability or military status or in any other way that would be a violation of the City’s nondiscrimination policies or practices.

G.    Designation Symbols. All uses of City trademarks on products will incorporate the appropriate trademark designation symbols, either ® or ™. In rare instances, omission of the symbols may be granted due to complications with production processes or when inclusion of the symbols interferes with the integrity of the design or significantly reduces consumer appeal. Generally, a trademark endorsement statement is included instead on the back of such items or on the package, label or hangtag. Registration marks are not required when trademarks are used by City departments in printed materials. Exemptions to this policy on other City items will be made on a case-by-case basis.

H.    Use of Trademarks on Commercial Products. The City has the right to decline any item and will not approve the use of its trademarks on certain types of products. These include but are not limited to the following:

1.    Business supplies—stationery, letterhead, business cards, uniforms, receipts, product labels, email signatures.

2.    Alcoholic beverages (unless produced by an official corporate sponsor of the City of Norco, per contract agreement).

3.    Tobacco products (unless produced by an official corporate sponsor of the City of Norco, per contract agreement).

4.    Inherently dangerous products—firearms, weapons, explosives, fuels.

5.    Illegal drug-related products.

6.    Goods related to gambling, lotteries, sweepstakes.

7.    Healthcare products and toiletries.

10.    Products in “poor taste,” including bathroom products.

11.    Products of a political nature.

12.

13.    Sexually suggestive products—inappropriate slogans imprinted on clothing and the configuration of certain novelty items.

14.    Products that present an unacceptable risk of liability.

15.    Products that are harmful to the mission or image of the City of Norco.

L.    Use of Trademarks in Advertising. Use of City of Norco trademarks in advertising requires prior approval (except as otherwise noted) from the City Manager’s office. City trademarks may, with approval, be used in the following kinds of advertising:

1.    By a commercial entity that is a licensee of the City of Norco, but only when there is an underlying related product that is licensed and only when the licensed product is being advertised (approval granted through license agreement). Retailers or licensed manufacturers may use pictures in advertisements showing licensed products with City indicia for sale.

2.    By a commercial entity in ads that are of an informational, congratulatory or community pride nature. These ads may not contain solicitation for the sale of their products or services, but the company name/logo may appear.

3.    In corporate advertisements in official programs sold or distributed at community events, subject to terms of a partnership license.

4.    In promotional activities pursuant to the terms of a promotional license. Promotional activities are activities such as advertising or offering promotional products to further the growth, development, acceptance and/or sale of goods or services.

5.    By companies that have done work for the City of Norco. The company may list the City name with other customers. These companies may include photographs of the actual work area, provided the City department who contracted the work approves of such use.

M.    Use of Trademarks by Other Municipalities/Public Agencies. Use of City trademarks by neighboring municipalities and public agencies will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In these instances, the City Manager’s office will determine when it is appropriate to use the official City seal or a City trademark.

N.    Use of Trademarks by Non-City Entities. Use of City trademarks by organizations that are not affiliated with the City of Norco will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may require a license agreement. The following guidelines generally apply:

1.    Businesses/organizations may use City trademarks in a nonpermanent fixture (e.g., window painting, removable lettering on marquees) supporting a City event or showing community pride. Such displays may not contain solicitation for the sale of their products or services, but the company name/logo may appear.

2.    Businesses/organizations may not establish a permanent statue or mural that includes City trademarks or likeness without written permission from the City Manager’s office.

3.    Businesses, individuals or organizations may not use the trademarks of the City on websites or social media sites without written permission from the City Manager’s office.

4.    Individuals or organizations may not use the City’s trademarks in conjunction with a candidate for political office or policy/legislative issue.

5.    With the exception of certain businesses that were established prior to the trademark and licensing program, private and/or corporate businesses may not use City trademarks in their business name. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

3.70.100 Trademark violations.
Trademark infringement is a violation of the exclusive rights attached to a trademark without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees (provided, that such authorization was within the scope of the license). Infringement may occur when one party, the “infringer,” uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party in relation to products or services that are identical or similar to the products or services that the registration covers. An owner of a trademark may commence legal proceedings against a party that infringes its registration. The City is prepared to enforce trademark infringements in order to protect its residents and to protect the City’s assets against the possibility of dilution of its trademarks and their value. Failure to obtain a license or approval from the City of Norco would be grounds for the seizure of all nonapproved products bearing the City’s marks. The City of Norco reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies against infringement of its trademarks. If the City engages the services of an agent, the agent is authorized to pursue enforcement actions on the City’s behalf. (Ord. 1050 Sec. 1, 2019)

5.04.200 License taxes--Exemptions.
(a)    Gross Receipts--Specified. Whenever a person carries on a business subject to a tax measured by his gross receipts, only those gross receipts which are directly attributable to the business operated and engaged in within the city shall be included within the measure of the tax. When, by reason of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States or the State Constitution, the measure of tax based on the gross receipts can not be enforced without there being an apportionment thereof according to the amount of business conducted by the person within the city or in the state of California, as the case may be, the collector may make such rules and regulations for the apportionment of the gross receipts and fixing the tax thereon as are necessary or desirable to overcome the constitutional objections. The rules and regulations shall avoid taxation of significant extra-territorial values and provide a measure of taxation fairly apportioned to the quantum of business actually done in the city.

In establishing the rules and regulations, the collector shall consider the following principles enunciated by the California Courts:

(1)    Unapportioned gross receipts may not be taxed if the receipts are derived from the wholesale sale of goods delivered from a point within the city to retail sellers outside the city;

(2)    Any business which involves the manufacturing and selling, or handling and selling, or assembly and selling, or storage, handling and selling, or processing and selling, may be taxed upon the unapportioned total gross receipts from the sale of such manufactured, assembled, handled, stored and handled, and processed goods, wherever the sales are made as to those goods wholly manufactured, handled, stored and handled, assembled or processed in the city;

(3)    Unapportioned gross receipts may not be taxed if the receipts are derived from the wholesale sale of products manufactured outside of the city and shipped into the city to persons for delivery pursuant to orders from such goods as placed in the city;

(4)    Unapportioned gross receipts may not be taxed if the receipts are derived from any sale of goods from an outlet outside the city to customers within the city after orders for the goods had been solicited in the city but the consummation of the sales transactions had been made outside of the city;

(5)    Unapportioned gross receipts may not be taxed if the receipts are derived from the wholesale sale of goods manufactured outside of the city and delivered to dealers or retail sellers outside of the city pursuant to orders for such as placed in the city.

(b)    Interstate Commerce.

(1)    None of the license taxes provided for herein shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the state.

(2)    In the event a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon the interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business, the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business, and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount which is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on the business of like nature; provided, however, the amount assessed shall not exceed the license tax provided herein.

(c)    Business Exempt by Federal and State Laws.

(1)    The provisions hereof shall not be deemed or construed to apply to any person carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the Constitution or applicable laws of the United States or of the state from the payment of the taxes provided for herein.

(2)    Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to the provisions of this section shall file a sworn statement with the collector stating the facts upon which an exemption is claimed. In the absence of such statement substantiating the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by the provisions thereof. The collector, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement, shall issue a license to such person claiming such exemption without payment to the city of the license tax required by the provisions hereof. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business, the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business, and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation.

(3)    The collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon information that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption as provided in this section.

(d)    Charitable Organizations.

Failure to produce a taxicab for such purpose will be sufficient grounds for the city to deny a sticker and/or to require that the vehicle be taken out of service until the taximeter has been checked, tested and sealed by such regulatory authority in accordance with the provisions of law. The cost of all such tests, checks and seals shall be borne by the holder of the permit. Proof of completion of this requirement shall be presented to the Business Licensing Official, or designee, prior to any issuance or renewal of a Taxicab Permit.

(B)    Rates--To be Filed.

At the discretion of the City Council, a public hearing may be set to consider the proposed rates. The City Council may require justification for the proposed rates. If the council does not hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days after the submittal, the proposed rates will be deemed to have been approved.

(5)    Every taximeter used in the operation of taxicabs shall be subject to inspection at any time by a duly authorized representative of the city, or by other appropriate authority, including a Sheriff’s Deputy.

No taximeter shall be so operated as to cause any charge to be registered thereon except during the time when the taxicab is engaged by a passenger or passengers.

(F)    Receipt for Charges. No driver of any taxicab, upon receiving full payment for a fare as indicated by the taximeter, shall refuse to give a receipt when requested.

6.12.130 Certain acts made unlawful.
It is unlawful:

(1)    For the owner of any vicious dog to fail, neglect, or refuse to keep posted in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the premises on which the dog is kept, a sign having letters at least two inches in width and reading “Beware of Vicious Dog.” It is unlawful for the owner of a vicious dog to permit such dog to run at large at any time;

(2)    For the owner or person in control of any dog to permit such dog to run at large in any public park or public building or upon any public school grounds, or near any bus stop, or to permit a female dog in heat to run at large at any time;

(3)    For any person to interfere with, oppose or resist any officer or person empowered to enforce the provisions of this chapter while such officer or other person is engaged in the performance of his duties as herein provided;

(4)    For any person to remove any impounded animal from the city pound without the consent of the officer in charge thereof;

(5)    For any person knowingly to violate any of the provisions of this chapter;

(6)    For any person, owning or having charge of the custody and control of a dog, whether licensed or unlicensed, to permit such dog to be at large on or in any place in the city of Norco, California, unless such dog is securely leashed and under the immediate control of the person or is confined within the property of the person by an enclosure, which prevents the dog from leaving the property, or is confined in a vehicle in such a manner that it is unable to escape therefrom; provided, however, such a person is not in violation of this section if such a dog is on the person’s property and under his immediate, continuing dominion and control, although not leashed or confined as required hereinabove. “Immediate continuing dominion and control” as used in this subsection is limited in its meaning to the exercise of discipline by the person over a dog in such a manner that the dog by training is unable to run from the person’s premises. It is the intent of the city council that the exception for dogs under the immediate continuing dominion and control of a person is a matter of defense to be alleged and proved by a person claiming to come within said exception and is not an exception which the people of the state of California have the burden of proving in a case charging a violation of this subsection;

(7)    For any person to keep or harbor more than ten cats, other than kittens under the age of three months, upon any residential premises of less than one acre. (Ord. 157 Sec. 2, 1971; Ord. 8 Sec. 2 (County Ords. 455.4 1, 2; 455.2 8: 455.1 8: 455 8), 1964)

Animals quarantined must not be removed from the premises without permission of the city manager or his officially designated representative. The city manager or his officially designated representative shall have the authority to impound any animal at the owner’s expense, if the owner fails or refuses to confine the animal. (Ord. 158 Sec. 2 (part), 1971; Ord. 8 Sec. 2 (County Ords. 455.16 3: 455.2 9: 455.1 9: 455 9), 1964)

6.12.150 Vicious dogs to be restrained—Violation.
If it shall be determined by the city manager or his officially designated representative, after giving the order of quarantine mentioned in this chapter, that the dog is a vicious dog, although not afflicted with rabies, the city manager or his officially designated representative shall thereupon order the person who owns or has the custody of the dog that until further order of the city manager or his officially designated representative, he shall keep the dog securely fastened by chain, or securely confined within private property, or keep the dog in such manner as the city manager or his officially designated representative shall direct to prevent it from biting or having the opportunity of biting any person. Failure to do so on the part of the owner or person having custody of the dog shall constitute a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 158 Sec. 2 (part), 1971; Ord. 8 Sec. 2 (County Ords. 455.2 10: 455.1 10: 455 10), 1964)

6.12.180 Animal with rabies biting another animal—Confinement.
Whenever any animal shall be bitten by another animal having rabies, or shows any symptoms of rabies, the owner or person having the possession of the animal shall immediately notify the city manager or his officially designated representative, and confine the animal, and keep it confined until it is established to the satisfaction of the city manager or his officially designated representative that it does not have rabies.

Whenever the city manager or his officially designated representative shall determine that an epidemic of rabies exists or is threatened, he shall have the authority to take such measures as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the spread of the disease, including the declaration of a quarantine against any or all animals in any area in the city as the city manager or his officially designated representative may determine and define, for a period of not more than one hundred twenty days. An additional or extended quarantine period may also be declared if the same shall be deemed necessary by the city manager or his officially designated representative for the protection and preservation of the public health, peace, and safety. Any quarantine declared under the provisions of this section other than as restricted herein, shall be upon such conditions as the city manager or his officially designated representative may determine and declare.

6.24.010 Definitions.
In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council of Norco, California, makes the following findings and declarations:

The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, constitutes a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

As used in this chapter:

(1)    “Vehicle” means a device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, except a device moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.

6.24.085 Abatement Notice—Historical Vehicle.
The requirements that not less than a 10-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance be issued, unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. However, the notice of intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof which is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) by a person specified in VC Section 22855, and is determined by the local agency to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety, provided that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. Prior to final disposition under VC Section 22662 of such a low-valued vehicle or part for which evidence of registration was recovered pursuant to subdivision (a) of VC 22661, the local agency shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of intent to dispose of the vehicle or part, and if the vehicle or part is not claimed and removed within 12 days after the notice is mailed, from a location specified in VC Section 22662, final disposition may proceed. No local agency or contractor thereof shall be liable for damage caused to a vehicle or part thereof by removal pursuant to this section. (Ord. 682, 1993)

This subdivision applies only to inoperable vehicles located upon a parcel that is (1) zoned for agricultural use or (2) not improved with a residential structure.

6.24.090 Hearing—Notice.
Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received by the city planning director or sheriff of Riverside County, California with ten days after the mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by the city council on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or parts thereof as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle or parts thereof against the property on which it is located.

If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such ten-day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require his presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered mail, at least ten days before the hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within ten days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance without holding a public hearing. (Ord. 153 Sec. 9, 1971)

6.24.100 Hearing—Procedure.
All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the city council who shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent. The facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or parts thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the private property or public property. The city council shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time or consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial.

The city council may impose such conditions and take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstance to carry out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or parts thereof if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may find that a vehicle or parts thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the city council shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.

If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land but does not appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the city council but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

(4)    Any other agencies as might be required by City, County, State, or federal law. (Ord. 38 Sec. 4, 1965)

6.32.050 Permit required.
A permit from the Public Works Department is required, except as set forth in Section 6.32.060, before the commencement of any physical work to raise or lower the existing grade of any lot, parcel or portion thereof, or for any excavation or filling which changes the grade of the natural slope of the surface of any lot, parcel or portion thereof so that it will not take natural runoff of water from adjacent lots or parcels as before the excavation or fill, or so that the surface drainage of the lot, parcel or portion thereof is concentrated or collected and discharges unto another lot or parcel in a different location or in greater quantity, or at an accelerated rate, or in such a way that it will probably result in damage, or in a way that creates a hazard to the public health, safety, or public property. Any permit issued hereunder shall be valid for the period specified, but shall not exceed one year. Unless the earth movement is commenced within the time specified in the permit, the permit shall expire; and if work upon such earth movement, after being started, ceases for a period of 90 days, the permit shall expire. Permits may be renewed by the Public Works Department upon payment of the renewal fee provided for in Section 6.32.140; however, any grading project that has exceeded the original termination date on the originally issued grading permit, regardless of any approved renewals, is deemed a nuisance and a negative impact to the community.

Failure to pay any impact mitigation fines will result in the levy of the fines against the property as a lien. (Ord. 985 Sec. 1, 2015; Ord. 38 Sec. 5, 1965)

6.32.060 Exceptions.
The following are specifically excepted from the provisions of this chapter:

(1)    An excavation below finished grade for a basement or footings for a building, or swimming pool, or other structures authorized by a valid building permit which has been issued by the City, but this exception shall not affect the applicability of any provisions of this chapter to any fill made with the material of such excavation;

(2)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this code, including Chapter 15.04, grading by excavation to a depth two feet or less; grading by fill to a height not exceeding one foot; grading by excavation or fill involving material which does not exceed a volume of 60 cubic yards, which grading is conducted on a lot or parcel established by a recorded deed or a recorded final subdivision or parcel map;

(3)    Any reclamation or rubbish disposal site operated by a government agency;

(4)    Any work done in City streets where a permit therefor has been granted under any City law, ordinance or regulation;

(5)    Any work done in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare in the event of emergency or disaster. (Ord. 985 Sec. 1, 2015; Ord. 339 Sec. 1, 1975; Ord. 38 Sec. 6, 1965)

6.32.070 Filing of map of proposed earth movement.
With the application for a permit and prior to commencement of work, there shall be submitted:

(1)    A finished grading plan prepared by the engineer showing the present contours extended a reasonable distance beyond the perimeter of the land, existing structures and facilities, and the proposed final grades. The proposed final grades shall clearly indicate cuts, fills and slopes. The estimated volumes of cut and/or fill and estimated dates for starting and completing the work shall be stated;

(2)    A written report shall be submitted by the soils engineer. The report shall indicate the type of soil, the unit foundation bearing values for the proposed construction at final grade, and include any pertinent data or opinion as to slopes which may be safely constructed;

(3)    Details of drainage structures, walls, cribbings, surface protection and landscaping that will be constructed or installed on the site. (Ord. 38 Sec. 7, 1965)

6.32.080 Standards for excavations and fills.
(a)    Steepness of slopes.

(1)    No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical, nor shall fills be made with slopes steeper than two horizontal to one vertical;

(2)    Steeper slopes than those required in subsection (1) above shall be permitted by the City Engineer, subject to the following conditions: A written report by a soils engineer, stating that he has investigated the site, made adequate tests and calculations, together with his opinion as to the degree of cut and/or fill slopes which may be constructed without endangering health, safety, or property.

(b)    Maximum height of slopes. No cut or fill slopes shall be constructed over 30 feet in height, unless the City Engineer is furnished evidence by a written report of a soils engineer that such slopes will be stable with a factor of safety at least one and five-tenths.

(c)    Drainage, general. All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to carry surface waters along a course approved by the City Engineer to the nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourse, or a safe place to deposit and receive such waters. Said drainage provisions shall be of such design so as not to endanger the health and safety of any property, either private or public. No natural watercourse shall be filled or restricted until provisions for adequate drainage, designed by the engineer and approved by the City have been installed.

(d)    Building pad grading. The Building Official shall approve the building pad grading at the time of final inspection for drainage of lots as shown on the approved grading plan. The approved grading plan shall be made available to the Building Official at this time.

(e)    Cross drainage requirements.

(1)    There shall be at least one terrace not less than five feet in width constructed in every fill slope greater than thirty feet in height or in cut slopes where the soil structure so requires by report of a soils engineer. The terrace shall be constructed so that surface drainage will be collected in a lined gutter or similar device located at the toe of the slope which terminates in the terrace. Water shall be carried laterally in said terrace to a catch basin or similar structure designed to collect surface drainage, the water to then be carried in a culvert or similar structure designed to take such water to the nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourse;

(2)    Other types of surface protection will be permitted in lieu of terraces when plans and specifications are submitted by the tract engineer or soils engineer, and said protection is approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 38 Sec. 8, 1965)

6.32.090 Compaction of fills.
The soils engineer shall control the compaction of all fills and shall certify that the complete fill meets the compaction requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 38 Sec. 9, 1965)

6.32.100 Construction of controlled fills.
As supervised by the soils engineer, the following shall be used as a guide for filled areas. For specific projects it may be necessary to make adjustment predicated upon the analysis of the material proposed to be used for the fill and other conditions pertaining to the project, and such adjustments may be made upon written recommendation of the soils engineer:

(1)    General description. The work shall consist of clearing and grubbing, removal of existing structures, preparation of land to be filled, filling of the land, spreading, compaction and control of the fill, structures and all subsidiary work necessary to complete the grading of all filled areas to conform with the lines, grades and slopes as shown on the accepted plans;

(2)    Clearing, grubbing and preparing areas to be filled.

(A)    All timber, logs, trees, brush, objectionable amounts of vegetable matter, and other rubbish shall be removed from the site so as to leave the areas free from all debris,

(B)    The surface shall then be plowed or scarified to a depth of at least six inches, and until the surface is free from ruts, hummocks or other uneven features which would tend to prevent uniform compaction by the equipment to be used,

(C)    Where fills are made on hillsides or adjacent to slopes greater than one vertical to four horizontal, continuous steps or benches shall be cut into firm and fully compacted material before filling is begun,

(D)    After the foundation for the fill has been cleared, plowed or scarified, it shall be disced or bladed until it is uniform and free from large clods; brought to the soil the proper moisture content; and compacted in the same manner and to the same degree as required for the fill material. Said foundation shall be compacted to the full depth of disturbance, and in no case shall the depth be less than six inches;

(3)    Materials. Materials for the fill shall consist of material approved by the soils engineer and may be obtained from the excavation of lands, borrow pits, or any other approved sources. The material used shall be soil free of rocks or lumps of greater dimension than six inches in the top 18 inches and shall not contain paper, wood, glass, tin, metal, cardboard, or any other deleterious substance;

(4)    Placing, spreading and compacting fill material.

(A)    All fills more than one foot in depth shall be compacted to not less than ninety percent of the maximum density as determined by the test method ASTM DIS 57 and ASTM D-1556 and latest revisions, after first clearing, grubbing and preparing the natural ground surface as described above in (2),

(B)    Field density tests shall be made at a frequency determined by the soils engineer, but in no case shall tests be made at a greater interval than two feet of vertical fill. Except for finished grades, which shall be tested to the surface, the test may be taken in the compacted material several inches below the disturbed surface. No additional layers of fill shall be spread until the field density tests indicate that the specified density has been obtained,

(C)    Where loose materials remain on the slope after the final elevation of the slope has been attained, these loose materials shall either be removed or be compacted to 83 percent, as determined by the test method listed in (4) (A), to a depth nine inches below the surface of the slope;

(5)    Supervision. Sufficient time shall be spent by the soils engineer on the site each day that fills are placed or other pertinent work is accomplished to permit the soils engineer to certify to the proper compaction of all fills and to the adherence with all other requirements of the ordinance for which he certified;

(6)    Seasonal limits. No fill material shall be placed, spread or rolled during unfavorable weather conditions. When work is interrupted by heavy rain, fill operations shall not be resumed until field tests by the soil engineer indicate that the moisture content and density of the fill are satisfactory for resumption of the filling operation. (Ord. 38 Sec. 10, 1965)

6.32.110 Relationship of buildings to cut and fill slopes.
(a)    Buildings or structures shall be located clear of the toe or top of cut or fill slopes according to the following:

(1)    A minimum of five feet provided the slope does not exceed ten feet in height;

(2)    One-half the vertical height of slope for slopes between ten feet and twenty feet in height with a maximum of ten feet.

(b)    Conforming slopes twenty feet or more in vertical height shall be provided with a designed retaining wall four feet in height above their toe for that portion of the slope paralleling any buildings with a distance of less than thirty feet between the building and toe of slope.

(c)    The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) may be waived upon acceptance by the city engineer of a report by the soils engineer stating that the distance specified can be safely reduced without endangering health, safety or property. (Ord. 38 Sec. 11, 1965)

6.32.120 Responsibility of permittee.
Buildings and grading permits shall be presumed to incorporate the proviso that the applicant, his agent, employees, or contractors shall carry out the proposed work in accordance with the approved plans and with all requirements of this chapter and any other laws or regulations applicable thereto, whether specified or not. No approval shall relieve or exonerate any person from the responsibility of complying with the provisions and intent of this chapter. (Ord. 38 Sec. 12, 1965)

6.32.130 Condition.
In granting a grading permit, the city engineer shall impose such conditions thereon as are reasonably necessary to prevent the proposed operations from being conducted in such a manner as to constitute or create a nuisance or hazard to life or property. Such conditions shall include:

(1)    Designation of a reasonable time limit for the commencement and completion of grading work;

(2)    Limitations upon the hours of the day, days of the week and seasons of the year for conducting grading operations;

(3)    The designation of routes on city streets along which dirt, earth, sand, gravel or similar materials shall be transported when the permit is for more than five hundred cubic yards;

(4)    Restrictions as to size and type of equipment to be used for hauling material on an improved city street for permits of more than five hundred cubic yards;

(5)    Provision for controlling dust and flying dirt by use of water and other means. (Ord. 38 Sec. 13, 1965)

These practices are designed to prevent the discharge of pollutants into stormwater runoff which enters the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), prevent leaching of nutrients into the groundwater and to minimize fly breeding and wind induced pollutants from stored manure. This chapter also requires all persons in the City of Norco who keep livestock to participate in the City’s manure collection program and pay the associated service fees. This is in pursuance of and in conjunction with existing environmental and water quality laws and regulations including Chapter 15.70, the municipal separate storm sewer system permit (MS4 permit), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1342).

The standards, regulations, and best management practices established in this chapter shall apply to all persons within the City limits of the City of Norco. Such persons who keep livestock shall participate in the City’s manure collection program and pay the attendant fees. Persons who do not keep livestock shall not be required to participate in the manure collection program. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.200 Best management practices for manure storage and disposal.
It shall be unlawful for any person to store or dispose of manure except by best management practices. Best management practices for the proper storage and disposal of manure must eliminate or minimize the potential of runoff containing pollutants and leaching of nutrients into groundwater or surface waters from areas where manure accumulates or is temporarily stored, and are as follows:

A.    Manure Storage on Private Property.

1.    Manure shall be removed from stalls, paddocks, arenas, corrals and other livestock keeping areas on a regular basis, i.e., daily is best but at a minimum weekly is required.

2.    Manure shall be stored in containers which are approved by the City or in a designated manure waste storage area constructed in conformance with the minimum guidelines established in this chapter.

3.    Manure storage, whether in a cart, dumpster bin, roll-off box or constructed structure, shall be stored at least 35 feet from the nearest neighboring dwelling unit.

4.    Approved containers are those supplied by the City’s franchise hauler and include carts, two-yard bins and roll-off boxes or otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works. All such containers shall be equipped with working lids to minimize water accumulating within the container.

5.    Manure storage areas shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize potential runoff. No manure storage structure or container shall be placed within 10 feet of a flood control channel or open storm drain. Storage areas shall be constructed with a three-walled, fireproof structure on a concrete base with a roof or tarp per standards established by the Public Works Director.

6.    Manure runoff which discharges onto adjacent property, onto City streets, horse trails, or into flood control channels is prohibited, and allowing such to occur, intentionally or negligently, shall be in violation of this chapter.

B.    Manure Collection Services.

1.    Persons who keep livestock shall regularly dispose of accumulated and stored manure. Manure shall be removed from properties on a weekly basis unless an approved hauler scheduling allows for a variation.

2.    All persons who keep livestock shall participate in the City manure collection program. The collection and transportation of manure from commercial and private properties within City boundaries shall be done utilizing the City designated franchise manure disposal contractor. However, persons who have been issued a valid self-haul permit may privately haul their manure to an approved designated disposal facility in lieu of the City’s manure collection contractor. In order to do so, such persons must be issued a self-haul permit from the City’s Public Works Director. Such permits shall be reviewed annually.

C.    Manure Spreading and Composting.

1.    Manure spreading over arenas, pastures, corrals or other livestock areas as an alternative means of disposal is prohibited and shall be in violation of this chapter.

2.    Manure composting is prohibited and shall be in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.210 Manure related charges, billing and collection.
Every person or owner of residential, commercial or public property or premises in the City of Norco that keeps livestock shall be billed for manure collection services pursuant to approved City billing practices. In accordance with the refuse service agreement, the City may handle contractor’s billings, collections and payments due contractor from persons served. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.220 Requirement to participate in the City’s manure program.
Every person or owner of residential, commercial or public property in the City of Norco that keeps livestock shall adhere to all manure management practices. Failure to participate in the City’s manure collection program shall subject the violator to the general penalties set forth in Chapter 1.04 and to administrative citations pursuant to Chapter 1.05. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.230 Manure self-haul permit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, one may provide his/her own service for the removal or disposal of manure created from his/her own residence upon making application for and receipt of the necessary permit from the Director of Public Works. The Director of Public Works shall issue a permit upon determination that the applicant is able to dispose of the manure by transporting the manure to a County-approved sanitary fill or approved facility in a safe and sanitary manner in accordance with the provisions of a self-haul permit. Such permit shall expire on the thirty-first of December each year, and may be renewed by the permittee for periods of one year upon written application to the Director of Public Works made prior to the expiration of the initial permit or any prior renewal thereof. A denial of an application for a permit or renewal thereof may be appealed to the City Council by the applicant filing with the City Clerk a notice of appeal within 10 days after receipt of the Director of Public Works’ written notice of denial. The decision of the City Council shall be final. No permit issued hereunder shall be transferred to any subsequent occupant of the same property. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.240 Mandatory recycling.
It shall be mandatory for all generators of residential, commercial, and industrial recyclables in the City that generate the minimum volume of refuse specified in any existing or future State laws or regulations (including but not limited to Public Resources Code Section 42649.2) to separate from refuse, for recycling purposes, all designated recyclables, to arrange for recycling services, and otherwise participate in recycling as described by this chapter. Furthermore, it shall be mandatory for all residential, commercial and industrial generators of organic waste in the City that generate the minimum volume of organics specified in any existing or future State laws or regulations (including but not limited to Public Resources Code Section 42649.81) to separate from refuse, for recycling purposes, all designated organics, to arrange for recycling services, and otherwise participate in recycling as described by this chapter. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.250 Recycling programs.

The City and the contract or franchise agent(s) shall assist in program development and provide technical expertise and training materials.

C.    Collection of recyclables from single-family residential units shall minimally occur once weekly. For commercial and industrial entities, collection of recyclables and organics shall be provided as needed to meet demand. However, due to the nature of decomposition of organic material the frequency of collection of organics shall be at a minimum on a weekly basis.

D.    The City encourages use of buy-back centers, donation centers (for used furniture and other reusable bulky items, and nonprofit agents), scrap dealers, home and commercial composting, source reduction, and other creative, lawful and environmentally sound efforts to reduce waste in accordance with this chapter that do not conflict with any established or planned City-sponsored recycling, composting or source-reduction programs. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.260 Mandatory fees for recycling.
A.    The City Council finds and determines that the regular collection of recyclables or organic materials by the contract or franchise agent(s) of the City from all places in the City is a service to the premises from which it is collected. All owners or occupants of premises generating recyclables shall pay the monthly collection fee charged by the City’s contract or franchise agent, not to exceed the City-approved maximum rates. A schedule of maximum rates shall be kept on file with the City Clerk and is available for public review. Maximum rates may be subject to increase pursuant to the terms of the City’s contract or franchise with the contract or franchise agent(s). Subject to the terms of the then-in-effect contract or franchise, the Council may from time to time establish such rates by resolution, including the establishment of rates for different classifications of quantity generators (small quantity generators, large quantity generators, residential, commercial, or industrial, or subclassifications thereof) or types of materials generated or other classifications which are deemed to be in the public interest.

B.    Pursuant to California Public Resources Code Section 41900 et seq., the City may, by resolution of the City Council, impose fees on City generators to pay the actual costs incurred by the City in preparing, adopting or implementing an integrated waste management plan in accordance with State mandates.

C.    No person shall willfully fail, neglect or refuse, after demand by the City, to pay the fees provided for herein. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.270 Separation of recyclable and organic materials, storage, and containers.
A.    The owner, operator, and/or occupant of any premises, business establishment, industry, or other property, vacant or occupied, shall be rebuttably presumed to be the generators of, and be responsible for the safe and sanitary storage of, all solid waste, designated recyclables, organic materials, and compost accumulated on the property. The designated recyclables, organics, and compost shall be stored separately from refuse. The property owner, operator, or occupant shall store such solid waste, designated recyclables, organics, and compost on the premises or property in such a manner so as not to constitute a fire, health, or safety hazard, and shall require it to be handled in such a manner so as not to promote the propagation, harborage, or attraction of vectors, or the creation of litter or other nuisances.

B.    A container or containers for designated recyclables and organics shall be provided by the contract or franchise agent(s) for any premises generating residential or commercial recyclables or organic materials, for the exterior collection of designated recyclables or organic materials. The containers shall effectively segregate the designated recyclables from refuse.

C.    All such containers to be used in the City’s recycling programs shall be approved by the City Manager, in conjunction with the contract or franchise agent(s).

D.    Designated recyclables and organic materials shall be sorted according to type and/or as established by program guidelines and placed in separate containers, containers with segregated compartments, or commingled (in one recycling container), as agreed upon by the City Manager and the contract or franchise agent(s). Containers, if more than one, shall be grouped together and placed for collection at the same time as when regular refuse collection occurs or at designated recycling collection times (if different from refuse collection) and at designated recycling collection locations.

E.    All containers used for recycling purposes, storage or collection, including commercial and industrial recycling containers used in City recycling programs as well as all other containers used for recycling purposes whether owned or operated by a commercial entity, nonprofit organization, or any other person or entity, shall be identified with the name and current telephone number of the owner or the responsible agency or person.

F.    Containers which do not comply with the requirements of this section shall be presumed to be refuse and taken by the contract or franchise agent(s) for disposal or potential use as salvaging or recycling containers.

G.    It shall be unlawful for any person to dispose, dump, or otherwise place material other than designated recyclables or organics in a designated recycling container or at a designated recycling collection or storage location.

H.    Exemption. Designated recyclables or organics which are source-sorted by their generator for the purpose of recycling by selling them to a buy-back center or donating them to a City-licensed nonprofit or community group conducting recycling programs for the purpose of raising funds do not have to be placed in the designated recycling container required by this section, nor placed in a designated recycling collection location in accordance with this section. When designated recyclables or organics are received by a City-licensed nonprofit or community group conducting recycling programs for the purpose of raising funds, they shall be stored and sorted in accordance with this section and transported to a buy-back center for the purpose of recycling. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.280 Recycling reports.

A.    Projects.

1.    Covered Projects. The following project categories are covered projects and must comply with this section:

a.    Any project requiring a permit for demolition or construction, unless defined as a noncovered project in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

b.    Any sequenced developments, such as housing subdivision construction or subdivision demolition, must be considered as a project in its entirety for purposes of this section, and not as a series of individual projects.

c.    Any individually built single-family home.

2.    Noncovered Projects. A performance deposit and waste management report shall not be required for the following:

a.    Work for which a construction or demolition permit is not required.

b.    Roofing projects that do not include tear-off of existing roof.

c.    Work for which only a plumbing, only an electrical, or only a mechanical permit is required.

d.    Seismic tie-down projects.

e.    Pool demolition project where materials are buried on site.

f.    Emergency required to protect public health and safety.

B.    Submission of Waste Management Report.

1.    Construction and Demolition Waste Management Report Forms. Applicants for any covered project shall complete and submit a construction and demolition waste management report on a waste management report form (WMR) approved by the City for this purpose. The WMR may be administratively updated by the Director of Public Works or his/her designee to meet the requirements of the City and California Green Building Standards Code. The purpose of the WMR is to illustrate how the applicant plans to comply with the diversion requirements per diversion requirement and the California Green Building Standards Code Sections 4.408 and 5.408. Upon project completion, which is defined as the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the WMR will illustrate how the applicant complied with the diversion requirements prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

2.    Initial Application. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code and California Green Building Standards Code, no construction or demolition permit may be issued until the initial construction and demolition waste management report has been approved by the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department will respond to the applicant’s WMR submittal within 10 business days with an approval, denial or request for clarification.

3.    Amount of Performance Deposit. The applicant for any covered project shall submit to the City a performance deposit for tenant improvements and individual single-family home construction, remodel, addition or renovation projects. The amount of the performance deposit shall be calculated as the greater of $250.00 or three-quarters of one percent of the total project cost for new construction and greater of $250.00 or one and one-half percent of the total project costs for demolition projects or $30,000 maximum. Acceptable forms of payment include cash, money order, or check.

Performance deposit funds in the form of cash, money order, or check will be placed in a secured account. The performance deposit shall be returned to the applicant upon acceptance of proof of compliance in full. If partial compliance, the performance deposit will be refunded on a prorated basis dependent on the degree of compliance.

4.    Documentation. Within 30 days after demolition is completed (if a demolition permit only) or 30 days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or at the time of issuing the last certificate of occupancy for units within a phased project of any covered project, the applicant shall submit to the Public Works Department documentation that it has met the diversion requirement for the project, unless applicant has been granted an exemption pursuant to subsection (C) of this section. The documentation shall include all of the following:

a.    Receipts from the vendor or facility that received each material, showing the actual weight or volume of that material;

b.    A copy of the completed waste management report form, in its entirety; photographs and narrative documentation of the applicant’s reuse activities.

5.    Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction, renovation and demolition waste diverted for reuse or disposed of is measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction, renovation and demolition waste shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction, renovation and demolition waste for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used.

6.    Determination of Compliance and Release of Performance Deposit. The Public Works Department shall review the information submitted under this section and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows:

a.    Compliance. If the Public Works Department determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, he or she shall cause the release of the performance deposit to the applicant within 60 days of the applicant’s submission of the documentation required under this section. If the applicant has complied in part, a portion of the performance deposit will be withheld. The amount withheld will be proportional to the percentage of materials that are not recycled/diverted.

b.    Noncompliance. If the Public Works Department determines that the applicant failed to submit the documentation within the required time period, then the performance deposit shall be forfeited to the City. All forfeited and/or unrecovered funds shall be used for waste reduction and recycling activities.

C.    Exemption.

1.    Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may request an exemption at the time that he or she submits the WMR. The applicant shall indicate on the WMR the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement.

2.    Meeting with Public Works Department. The Public Works Department shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement.

3.    Granting of Exemption. If the Public Works Department determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMR submitted by the applicant. The Public Works Department shall return a copy of the WMR to the applicant marked “Approved with Exemption.” The applicant shall then be responsible for diverting the revised rate noted by the Public Works Department on the approved WMR, in compliance with the provisions of this section.

4.    Denial of Exemption. If the Public Works Department determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall resubmit a WMR form in full compliance with this section. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMR, or if the resubmitted WMR does not comply with this section, the Public Works Department shall deny the WMR.

D.    Appeal. Appeals of a determination made by the Public Works Department under this section shall be made to the City Manager or designee. The appeal shall be in writing and filed with the City Clerk within 10 business days of issuance of the Public Works Department decision. The appeal shall be limited to the following issues: (1) the granting or denial of an exemption; and (2) the amount of security to be released. The decision of the City Manager or designee shall be final. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

6.42.320 Enforcement.

B.    Types of materials included in designated recyclables or organics may be administratively added or deleted by the City Manager under emergency conditions (to include market failures), subject to formal ordinance amendment approved by the City Council, if such conditions persist.

C.    It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. In addition to other remedies provided by law, any person violating any provision of this chapter for failing to comply with any of the requirements is deemed guilty of an infraction in the manner provided in Section 1.04.010.

D.    Each person shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and every day, or any portion thereof, during which any violation of or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such person.

E.    Each such violation shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.04.010.

F.    Nothing in this chapter or its implementing regulations shall prevent the City or its contract or franchise agent(s) from efforts to obtain voluntary compliance by way of warning, notice of violation, educational or other means. (Ord. 1049 Sec. 1, 2019; Ord. 1045 Sec. 1, 2019)

Minimum annual fee regardless of number of hogs allowable is one hundred dollars. This fee shall be payable in advance on or before July 1st of each year, except in cases of new permits issued after July 1st of any fiscal year, in which cases the inspection fee shall be prorated for the remaining portion of the year and payable before the new permit shall become effective.

No such change may have a retroactive effect.

(b)    Upon action of the city clerk, an increase in maximum number of hogs allowable can be effected only upon the payment of the requisite fee and compliance with procedures set out herein for a new permit, except that the application may incorporate by reference any and all material filed by the permittee as a part of his original application, or any of his subsequent applications, providing the materials to be incorporated appear in the files of the planning commission or city clerk.

9.04.040    Exceptions.

9.04.050    Enforcement.

9.04.010 Purpose and Intent.
The City Council declares its purpose and intent in enacting this Chapter is as follows:

(1)    The ability to make reasoned judgments, resist peer pressure and understand the consequences of improper behavior increase with age, knowledge and experience, all of which are likely to increase as a person grows older, and these factors justify the application of a curfew to minors, but not adults.

(2)    Juvenile crime, especially nighttime crime, has increased over the years and jurisdictions enforcing a nocturnal juvenile curfew have experienced a reduction in crime and non-criminal mischief. (Ord. 592, 1989)

(3)    In recent years, minors have increasingly been victims of violent crime and the adoption and enforcement of a curfew ordinance will tend to reverse this trend.

(4)    Curfew ordinances tend to reinforce parental authority and supervision.

9.04.020 Definition of Minor.
For the purposes of this Chapter, any person under the age of eighteen shall be deemed a minor. (Ord. 592, 1989)

9.04.030 Curfew hours.
It is unlawful for any minor under the age of eighteen to loiter, about or upon the public streets, avenues, alleys, parks, playgrounds or other public grounds, public places, public buildings, places of amusement and eating places, vacant lots or any unsupervised place during the following periods of time:

(1)    Between the hours of ten p.m. and six a.m. of the following day for minors fourteen years of age or younger;

(2)    Between the hours of eleven p.m. and six a.m. of the following day for minors either fifteen or sixteen year of age;

(3)    Between the hours of twelve midnight and six a.m. of the following day for minors seventeen years of age.

9.04.040 Exceptions.
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the following:

(1)    Any minor accompanied by a parent, legal guardian or a responsible adult to which custody of the minor has been given by the parent or legal guardian;

(2)    To any minor performing any task at the direction of his or her legal guardian or to any minor responding to an emergency with or without parental consent;

(3)    To any minor then acting within the course and scope of his or her employment;

(4)    To any minor on the property of, or the sidewalk directly adjacent to, or the buildings immediately adjacent to the building in which he or she resides;

(5)    To any minor legally married;

(6)    To any minor in the military service of the United States; (Ord. 592, 1989)

(7)    To any minor attending organized association activity, such as school meetings, classes or sporting events, religious meetings, dances, concerts, theatrical performances, or similar events, or other constitutionally protected activity;

(8)    To any minor engaged in reasonable and direct travel to and from those activities described in the above exceptions.

9.04.050 Enforcement.
Every police officer is hereby authorized and empowered to go upon public and private property to demand from any person, whom the officer has reasonable cause to believe is in violation of Section 9.04.030, that such person give his or her name, address, proof of age, the name of parent, guardian or adult having care of custody of such person, and other information reasonably necessary to determine whether such violation exists.

9.05.010 Declaration of Intent.
The Council finds and declares that minors and young adults are meeting in large groups on foot or by automobile in the parking lots of shopping centers, remaining there to use the parking lots for purposes other than what they are intended (i.e., parking while shopping). The numbers entering and exiting, and the milling around of automobiles, creates a safety hazard to pedestrians and drivers alike in the lots and on adjoining streets and prevents or interferes with parking by customers. Litter from broken bottles, empty beverage cans, discarded food wrappers and cigarette butts quickly accumulate on the lot and in the adjoining centers and neighborhoods, creating a health hazard. Nearby yards are trampled, nearby stores and buildings are vandalized. Confrontation and fights develop and younger children and customers of the centers are intimidated and frightened. These problems are particularly difficult to regulate, or prevent. The Council declares that the use of parking lots in shopping centers in this manner is a public nuisance and requires regulation. (Ord. 590, 1989)

9.05.020 Scope of Law.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to be in conflict with or as a limitation upon any of the provisions of the Penal Code or the Vehicle Code of the State of California.

9.05.040 “Unlawful Acts.”
(1)    When a sign is in place giving notice of the provisions hereof, it shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to park it or allow it to remain parked upon any parking lot in, of or adjacent to a shopping center in the City of Norco except while the driver or the occupants of the vehicle are patronizing a store or service of said shopping center.

(2)    When a sign is in place giving notice of the provision hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person to be or remain upon any parking lot in, of or adjacent to a shopping center in the City of Norco except:

a.    While crossing said lot in the course of entering or exiting a store or service at said shopping center.

b.    While exiting, entering or being in a vehicle whose driver or occupant is patronizing a store or service of said shopping center or while said vehicle is exiting or entering said parking lot.

(3)    It shall be unlawful for any person to be or remain upon any parking lot in, of or adjacent to a shopping center when asked to leave by a police officer or the owner thereof or his duly authorized agent.

(4)    When a sign is in place giving notice of the provisions hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate a radio or other sound amplifier emitting loud and raucous noises with the intent to cause a public disturbance or annoyance.

9.05.050 Exceptions.
The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply:

(1)    To any person or persons who have written permission of the owner of said parking lot to be or remain on said lot or to park a vehicle upon said lot and presented to a peace officer on demand. (Ord. 590, 1989)

(2)    Where its application would result in an interference with or inhibition of any exercise of a constitutionally protected right of freedom of speech, such as (but not limited to) peaceful expression of political or religious opinions not involving offensive personal conduct.

(3)    Where its application results or is coupled with an act prohibited by the Unruh Civil Rights Act or any other provision of law relating to prohibited discrimination against any person on account of color, race, religion, creed, ancestry or national origin.

(4)    Where its application would result in an interference with or inhibition of peaceful labor picketing or other lawful labor activities. (Ord. 590, 1989)

9.07.050 Sound level measurement methodology.
If the sound standard being applied is measured in decibels, then sound level measurements pursuant to this section shall be required to establish a violation of this chapter. If the sound standard being applied is not measured in decibels, then sound level measurements are not required to establish a violation of this chapter. Sound level measurements may be made anywhere within the boundaries of an occupied property. The actual location of a sound level measurement shall be at the discretion of the enforcement officials identified in Section 9.07.080. Sound level measurements shall be made with a sound level meter. Immediately before a measurement is made, the sound level meter shall be calibrated utilizing an acoustical calibrator meeting the standards of the American National Standards Institute. Following a sound level measurement, the calibration of the sound level meter shall be reverified. Sound level meters and calibration equipment shall be certified annually. (Ord. 979 Sec. 1, 2014)

9.07.060 Special sound sources standards.
The general sound level standards set forth in Section 9.07.040 apply to sound emanating from all sources, including the following special sound sources, and the person creating, or allowing the creation of, the sound is subject to the requirements of that section. The following special sound sources are also subject to the following additional standards, the failure to comply with which constitutes separate violations of this chapter:

A.    Motor Vehicles.

1.    Off-Highway Vehicles.

a.    No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle unless it is equipped with a USDA-qualified spark arrester and a constantly operating and properly maintained muffler. A muffler is not considered constantly operating and properly maintained if it is equipped with a cutout, bypass or similar device.

b.    No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle unless the noise emitted by the vehicle is not more than 96 dBA if the vehicle was manufactured on or after January 1, 1986, or is not more than 101 dBA if the vehicle was manufactured before January 1, 1986. For purposes of this subsection, emitted noise shall be measured a distance of 20 inches from the vehicle tailpipe using test procedures established by the Society of Automotive Engineers under Standard J-1287.

2.    Sound Systems. No person shall operate a motor vehicle sound system, whether affixed to the vehicle or not, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., such that the sound system is audible to the human ear inside any inhabited dwelling. No person shall operate a motor vehicle sound system, whether affixed to the vehicle or not, at any other time such that the sound system is audible to the human ear at a distance greater than 100 feet from the vehicle. Sound level measurements may be used, but are not required to establish a violation of this subsection.

9.09.010 Purpose and Intent
The City Council finds, determines, and declares that this chapter has been enacted based upon the following facts and purposes:

(A)    School absenteeism is a problem that plagues our schools and creates a burden for all communities throughout the city.

(B)    Students who are absent from school without valid excuses are denied an education.

(C)    The unexcused absence of students from school results in the loss of state and federal funding to the detriment of all students.

(D)    Unsupervised students involve themselves in unsafe activities by being in residential neighborhoods, business districts, and malls during the time when they are required to be in school.

(E)    Unsupervised students engage in criminal activity to the detriment of the community, such as residential burglaries, auto thefts, bicycle thefts, vandalism, and other visible signs of disorder.

(F)    Unsupervised students become a burden on police, who must return them to school, wait for parents to pick them up, and investigate any and all criminal activity related to a student’s absenteeism.

(G)    The City of Norco has a compelling interest in protecting the public from juveniles committing crimes, increasing the exercise of parental responsibility for the city’s children, in reducing the opportunities for juvenile crime, and in improving school attendance. The U.S. Department of Education in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice prepared a manual to combat truancy, which cited truancy as the most powerful predictor of juvenile delinquent behavior. When school attendance increases, daytime juvenile crime decreases. Conversely, a drop in school attendance correlates to an increase in juvenile crime during school hours.

(H)    It is, therefore, the intent of the City Council in enacting this chapter to prohibit any minor under the age of eighteen, who is subject to compulsory education or compulsory continuation education, subject to specific expectations related herein, from being in or upon the public streets, highways, roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, or other public grounds during the period of the day when the minor is required to be in school, subject to the exceptions and terms of this chapter.

(I)    It is further the intent of the City Council to provide appropriate criminal sanctions against any minor who violates this chapter by making a violation of this chapter an infraction.

(J)    It is the intent of the City Council to allow minors under the age of 18 to move about freely while participating in legitimate activities, and to pursue legitimate activities during the day with the permission of his or her parent, guardian, or other adult person having the lawful care and custody of the minor. (Ord. 848, 2006)

9.09.020 Definitions
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words shall be defined as follows:

(A)    “Emergency” means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes but is not limited to the following: a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury, hardship, or loss of life.

(B)    “Guardian” means (a) a person who, under court order, is the guardian of the person of a minor; or (b) a public or private agency with whom the minor has been placed by court order; or (c) a person at least eighteen years of age exercising care and custody of the minor and having written authorization to do so.

(C)    “Minor” means any person under eighteen years of age.

(D)    “Parent” means any person who is a natural parent, adopting parent, or stepparent of a minor.

(E)    “Public place” means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access, including but not limited to streets, highways, beaches, parks, playgrounds, and common areas of schools, hospitals, apartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities, theaters, game rooms, shops, shopping malls, or any other public place of business.

(F)    “Street” means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for the purpose of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk, for pedestrian travel. The term “street” includes the legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the traffic lanes, curbs, sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, equestrian trails, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term “street” applies irrespective of what the legal right-of-way is formally named or called, whether alley, avenue, court, road, or otherwise.

This provision shall also apply to minors whose enrollment status is that of suspension, expulsion, or transfers in progress.

9.09.040 Exceptions
The minor(s) shall not be held liable under § 9.09.030 if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

(A)    The minor is accompanied by his or her parent, legal guardian, or other adult person having the lawful care and custody of the juvenile;

(B)    The minor is involved in an emergency;

(C)    The minor is going directly to or coming directly from the minor’s place of gainful employment with a valid school work permit;

(D)    The minor is going to or from a medical appointment for the minor or for the minor’s parent or guardian, and can show proof of that appointment;

(E)    The minor is off campus for lunch and has in his or her possession a valid, school-issued off-campus permit; and has conformed to all the conditions and restrictions of the lunch pass;

(K)    The minor is otherwise exempt by law from compulsory education or compulsory continuing education.

9.09.050 Enforcement
Before taking any enforcement action under this chapter, a law enforcement officer shall ask the apparent offender’s age and reason for being in the public place or on the premises of the establishment during curfew or truancy hours. The officer shall not issue a citation or make an arrest under this section unless the officer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred and that no defense exists.

9.09.060 Violation
Each violation of any of the provisions set forth herein shall constitute a separate offense and shall be classified as an infraction. Juveniles shall be dealt with in accordance with laws and procedures applicable to juvenile offenders, and offenses may be heard in any court designated to hear them.

9.09.070 Hearing Requirement
A minor cited for a violation of this chapter must attend a court hearing on the violation, and must be accompanied at the hearing by his or her parent or guardian. If any such parent or guardian fails to attend the hearing with the minor, and unless the interests of justice would otherwise be served, the court shall continue the hearing and shall issue a citation to said parental or custodial person, directing that person to appear at the continued hearing with the minor (pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 661).

9.10.010 Purpose, intent and findings.
The city council finds, determines and declares that this chapter has been enacted based upon the following facts and purposes:

(1)    The occurrence of parties, gatherings, or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance; and

(2)    According to local, state and federal surveys, alcohol is overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age levels, and a child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol use until age 20 or older; and

(3)    The occurrence of parties, gatherings, or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance; and

(4)    The city of Norco has made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking and consumption laws. Despite these efforts, use of alcohol by youth remains a serious problem in the city, contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime, addiction, sexual assault, truancy, driving under the influence of alcohol, and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol and causing injury and/or death; and

(5)    Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential or commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to, possession by, and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons. Persons responsible for the occurrence of parties, gatherings, or events on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons at these gatherings; and

(6)    Control of parties, gatherings, or events on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons is necessary when such activity is determined to be a public nuisance; and

(7)    Persons held responsible for abetting or allowing parties, gatherings, or events where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at parties, gatherings or events held on property in their possession or under their control; and

(8)    In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have responded and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to parties, gatherings, or events on private property at which alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons, and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the city, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents, and also result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city; and

(9)    Problems associated with parties, gatherings, or events at which alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or possessed by underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the city has the legal authority to penalize said action; and

(10)    The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and enjoyment of residential property and general welfare; and

(11)    Section 25658 of the State of California Business and Professions Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years to purchase, or attempt to purchase, or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years; and

(12)    The city council of the city of Norco therefore determines that this chapter is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the city of Norco. (Ord. 904 Sec. 1, 2009)

9.10.020 Definitions.

(2)    “Juvenile” means any person less than 18 years of age.

(3)    “Minor” means any person less than 21 years of age.

Said parties, gatherings or events where alcoholic beverages are consumed by, provided to or possessed by underage persons shall constitute a public nuisance.

(5)    “Person responsible for the event” means and includes, but is not limited to:

(A)    The person who owns, rents, leases or otherwise has control of the premises where the party, gathering, or event occurs; and/or

(B)    The person in charge of the premises; and/or

(C)    The person who organized the event; and/or

(D)    The person who supervised the event.

(6)    “Underage person” means any person less than 21 years of age and shall have the same meaning as “minor,” as defined in subsection (3) of this section. (Ord. 904 Sec. 1, 2009)

This prohibition shall not apply to parties, gatherings or events where religious services and/or activities protected by Article 1, Section 4 of the California Constitution are exercised, nor shall the prohibition apply to the consumption of an alcoholic beverage by a minor at any place not open to the public when the minor is being supervised by his or her own parent or legal guardian. (Ord. 904 Sec. 1, 2009)

9.10.040 Enforcement.
(1)    Any person violating Section 9.10.030 is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 and/or imprisonment of not more than six months, except as noted in subsection (2) of this section.

(2)    Violations of this chapter shall be punishable by the city attorney as provided by Chapter 1.04, with the city attorney having discretion to reduce any violation of this chapter to an infraction.

(3)    The procedures provided for in this section are in addition to any other statute, ordinance or law, civil or criminal. This section in no way limits the authority of law enforcement officers or private citizens to make arrests for any criminal offense arising out of conduct regulated by this chapter.

Chapter 9.50
AGGRESSIVE PANHANDLING
Sections:

9.50.010    Findings.

9.50.020    Authority and purpose.

9.50.030    Applicability.

9.50.040    Definitions.

9.50.050    Aggressive solicitations prohibited.

9.50.060    All solicitations prohibited at specified locations—Lingering and loitering prohibited on medians.

9.50.070    Exemptions.

9.50.080    Penalty.

9.50.010 Findings.
The City Council hereby finds, determines and declares that:

a)    Solicitations made in an aggressive manner are unsafe and disruptive to persons in the City of Norco and are a threat to public health, safety, and general welfare. Aggressive solicitations typically include approaching or following pedestrians, the use of abusive language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

b)    An increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the City has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation, and disorder.

c)    Aggressive solicitation from people in places where they are a “captive audience” in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid solicitation from others is problematic, detracts from the rights of persons in the City to quietly enjoy public facilities, and presents a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops, as well as gas stations.

d)    The presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous. Such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property. Restricting solicitation in such places will provide balance between the rights of solicitors and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such solicitations, and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations.

e)    Aggressive solicitation on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections and in the public roadway, and lingering and loitering on a median are unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians, and the general public. Aggressive soliciting on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to safely operate their motor vehicle and watch traffic. This may result in traffic collisions, congestion and blockage of streets, and delay the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety concerns.

f)    The Council’s intent in enacting this chapter is not to interfere with the exercise of First Amendment rights of those engaged in solicitation on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway, and lingering and loitering on the medians. This is meant to minimize the safety hazards of those in such areas as well as the drivers and passengers in vehicles sharing the roadway.

g)    The practice of aggressive solicitation near driveways accessing shopping centers, retail, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians, and the general public. The location of the solicitor near the driveway compromises the solicitor’s safety, impedes visibility, and impairs the driver’s ability to safely enter and exit. Drivers also become distracted from their duty to operate their motor vehicle and watch traffic, which may result in traffic collisions, congestion and blockage of streets, and delay the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety concerns.

h)    The restrictions of this chapter are content-neutral and are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, but still provide alternative avenues of communication.

i)    The reasonable time, place and manner restrictions in this chapter avoid the negative effects of aggressive solicitation and solicitation in unsafe places and will not unreasonably restrict free speech of people engaged in solicitation. (Ord. 1014 Sec. 1, 2017)

9.50.020 Authority and purpose.
a)    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the City of Norco in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution.

b)    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to protect public health, safety, and the general welfare of people in the City of Norco and improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Norco by imposing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on certain forms of solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens as further described in the findings set forth in Section 9.50.070.

c)    The California Supreme Court has held such regulation of solicitation does not violate the liberty of speech clause of the California Constitution in the case of Los Angeles Alliance for Survival v. City of Los Angeles. (Ord. 1014 Sec. 1, 2017)

9.50.030 Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply generally to all property throughout the City wherein any of the conditions specified in this chapter are found to exist; provided, however, that any condition that constitutes a violation of this chapter, but which is permitted or authorized under any local, State, or Federal law, shall not be deemed to violate this chapter.

9.52.010 Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to help prevent the spread of graffiti and to establish a program for its removal from public and private property. The spread of graffiti on public and private buildings, walls, signs and other structures or places or other surfaces causes blight within the City, resulting in a genuine threat to life, incalculable economic losses to businesses in terms of physical property, profits and goodwill, and the general deterioration of property and business values for adjacent and surrounding properties. The power of graffiti to create fear and insecurity within the community and blight upon the landscape, reducing property values and detracting from the sense of the community enjoyed by residents of Norco is beyond the cost of cleanup or removal. Not only is graffiti a property crime, but a social crime on the quality of life and freedom from intimidation citizens desire within their neighborhoods. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

9.52.070 Graffiti removal at City expense.
Whenever the Public Works Director or designated representative determines that graffiti is so located on public or private property within the City so as to be capable of being viewed by persons utilizing any public right-of-way in the City, the Public Works Director or designated representative is authorized to provide for the removal of the graffiti at the City’s expense, pending reimbursement from the property owner upon whose property the graffiti has been applied upon the following conditions:

A.    In removing the graffiti, the painting or repair shall be limited to the minimum necessary to properly restore the defaced area.

9.52.080 Public nuisance.
Graffiti which the Public Works Director or authorized representative has determined exists on any permanent structure in the City which is visible from a street or other public or private property is declared to be a public nuisance. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

9.52.090 Graffiti declared public nuisance.
Graffiti on public or private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such vandalism but also depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties, and in so doing has a negative impact on the entire City. Cal. Gov’t Code § 53069.3 authorizes the City, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed materials from private as well as public property. The City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and unless it and other inscribed materials are removed from public and private property, they tend to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods are affected and the entire community depreciates in value and becomes a less desirable place in which to be. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

9.52.100 Abatement.
Whenever the Public Works Director or authorized representative determines that graffiti on a particular structure constitutes a public nuisance, such graffiti shall be abated as follows:

A.    Notice. The Public Works Director shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have 48 hours after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti, or the property will be subject to abatement by the City.

B.    Service of Notice. The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner’s name and address appears on the last equalized property tax assessment rolls of the county of Riverside. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this chapter may be served in any one of the following manners:

1.    By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property.

2.    By certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address.

The notice shall be substantially in the following form:

NOTICE OF INTENT TO REMOVE GRAFFITI

Date:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required by law at your expense to remove or paint over the graffiti located on the property commonly known as, Norco, California, which is visible to public view, within 48 hours after the date of this notice; or, if you fail to do so, City employees or private contractors employed by the City will enter upon your property and abate the public nuisance by removal or painting over the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the City employees or its private contractors will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid.

All persons having any objection to, or interest in said matters are hereby notified to submit any objections or comments to the Public Works Director for the City of Norco or designated representative within ten (10) days from the date of this notice. At the conclusion of the 48-hour period to abate, the City may proceed with the abatement of the graffiti inscribed on your property at your expense without further notice.

C.    Appeal. Within 10 days from the mailing or personal service of the notice, the owner or person occupying or controlling such premises or lot affected may appeal to the City Council of the City of Norco. At a regular meeting or regular adjourned meeting of the City Council not more than 20 days thereafter, the Council shall proceed to hear and pass upon such appeal. The decision of the Council thereupon shall be final and conclusive.

D.    Removal by City. Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the Public Works Director or designated representative approves, then the Public Works Director is authorized and directed to cause the graffiti to be abated by City resources or private contract, and the City or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the City, and any paint used to obliterate graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s).

E.    Record of Cost for Abatement. The Public Works Director and/or the Finance Director shall keep an account of costs (including, but not limited to, court costs, attorney’s fees, cost of removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material, costs of repair and replacement of defaced property, incidental and administrative costs, and any law enforcement costs incurred in the investigation and apprehension of a person causing the graffiti damage) of abating such nuisance on each separate parcel of land where the work is done and shall render an itemized report in writing to the City Council showing the cost of abatement; provided, that before the report is submitted to the Council a copy shall be served in accordance with the provisions of this section, together with a notice of time when the report shall be heard by the Council for confirmation.

1.    The City Council shall set the matter for hearing to determine the correctness and reasonableness of such costs.

2.    The term “incidental expenses” shall include, but not be limited to, the actual expenses and costs of the City in the preparation of notices, specifications and contracts and in inspecting the work, and the costs of printing and mailing required hereunder.

F.    Report—Hearing and Proceedings. At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the report, the City Council shall hear and pass the report of such costs of abatement, together with any objections or protests. Thereupon, the City Council may make such revision, correction or modification in the report as it may deem just, after which, by motion, the report as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified shall be confirmed. The decision of the City Council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive.

G.    Assessment of Costs against Property. The total cost for abating such nuisance, as confirmed by the City Council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates, and upon notice and recordation in the office of the Riverside County recorder of a notice of lien, as so made and confirmed, shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such assessment pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 38773.5.

1.    After such confirmation and recordation, a copy shall be filed with the assessor and tax collector of Riverside County, acting for the City, in order that said county officials may add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against the respective lots and parcels of land, and thereafter said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes; or

2.    After such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law.

H.    Second or Subsequent Civil Judgment. Upon the entry of a second or subsequent civil judgment within a two-year period, the City may find that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated in accordance with this section, may request the court order treble damages pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 38773.7. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

If the developer fails to abate a graffiti condition, either voluntarily or after requested to do so by the City, the City shall purchase the necessary anti-graffiti material and/or paint for the purpose of graffiti removal. All costs of removal shall be assessed in accordance with Sections 6.22.110 through 6.22.130 and 9.52.170. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

In the event of multiple contributions of information, the reward amount shall be divided by the City in the manner it shall deem appropriate. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the violator to a community service program, a plea bargain to a lesser offense, or the sustaining of any juvenile petition filed pursuant to Cal.

9.52.170 Defendant’s liability for cost of graffiti abatement.
A.    Defendant Determined to Be the Responsible Party. When the disposition of a criminal case or a proceeding pursuant to Cal. Welf. and Inst. Code § 602 determines that the defendant in that case is responsible for creating, causing or committing the graffiti which was abated by the City, that same defendant shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City.

These costs shall be recovered from the defendant who has been determined to be the responsible party as outlined above. These costs shall be recovered as follows:

1.    Adult Defendants. A civil action may be pursued to obtain a monetary judgment against the defendant for any amount not ordered or collected by the criminal court in which the matter was heard. Such monetary judgments may be filed or recorded to create a lien against personal or real property as permitted by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 697.010 et seq.

2.    Juvenile Defendants. A civil action may be pursued to obtain a monetary judgment against the juvenile defendant and/or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) having custody and control of the minor for any amount not ordered or collected by the juvenile court in which the matter was heard. Such monetary judgments will be filed or recorded to create a lien against personal or real property as permitted by Cal. Gov’t Code § 38772 et seq.

a.    Lien and Personal Obligation. The expense of abating the graffiti nuisance may result in a lien against the property of a minor and a personal obligation against the minor. The parent(s) or guardian(s) having custody and control of the minor shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code §§ 38772, 38773.2 and 38773.6.

i.    Notice of Intent to Lien. Notice of intent to record a lien shall be given to the owner of record of any parcel prior to the recordation of any lien. The owner may be the minor, or the parent(s) or legal guardian having custody and control of the minor. Said notice shall be served by personal service in the same manner as a civil action in accordance with the Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 415.10. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of 10 days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property is located pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 6062.

iii.    Specific Data. A graffiti nuisance abatement lien authorized by this section shall specify the amount of the lien; the name of the agency on whose behalf the lien is imposed; the date of the abatement order; the street address, legal description, and assessor’s parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed; and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel.

iv.    If the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the information specified in subsection (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section shall be recorded by the governmental agency. A graffiti nuisance abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed in the grantor-grantee index.

v.    A graffiti nuisance abatement lien may be satisfied through foreclosure in an action brought by the City.

vi.    The City may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien.

b.    Special Assessment. As an alternate to the nuisance lien, the City may recover its costs, as delineated above, by a special assessment against the parcel of land owned by the minor or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 38773.7.

c.    Second or Subsequent Criminal Judgment. Upon the entry of a second or subsequent criminal judgment within a two-year period, the City may find that an owner of property is responsible for a condition that may be abated in accordance with this section, and may request the court order treble damages pursuant to Cal. Gov’t Code § 38773.7. (Ord. 997 Sec. 2, 2015)

9.75.010 Intent and Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive set of regulations applicable to newsracks on public right-of-ways. The purpose of this chapter is to advance and improve safety and aesthetics by controlling the number, size, construction, placement and appearance of newsracks without restricting the free dispersal of information guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States and the State of California.

More specifically, the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by regulating the placement, appearance, servicing and insuring newsracks so as to protect against the dangers of impairing or distracting the vision of motorists and pedestrians; the hazards of unreasonably interfering with or impeding the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including ingress into or egress from any residence or place of business, or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles; unreasonably interfering with the use of public property for its intended purpose; unduly restricting access to the use of poles, ports, traffic signs or signs, hydrants, mailboxes or locations used for transportation purposes; unsightly structures inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the City’s design regulations; neglectful servicing of newsracks resulting in visual blight on public right-of-ways and other public property and detracting from the aesthetics of store window displays, adjacent landscaping and other improvements; reduction in value of surrounding properly; and unnecessary exposure of the City to personal injury or property damage claims or suits.

The City Council finds and determines that the strong and competing interests of the public and of newspapers require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this chapter which is designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place and manner of using newsracks. It is not the intent of this chapter to in any way discriminate against, regulate or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or dissemination of any newspapers.

9.75.020 Definitions

“Distributor” shall mean any person responsible for placing and maintaining a newsrack in a public right-of-way.

“Newsrack” shall mean any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser installed, used, or maintained for the display or distribution or sale of publications.

“Public right-of-way” shall mean any place of any nature, which is dedicated to use by the public for pedestrian travel, and includes, but is not limited to, a sidewalk, curb, parkway, lane, mall, court, park, square, and any other similar public way.

“Roadway” shall mean that part of a public right-of-way that is designated and used primarily for vehicular traffic.

9.75.030 Permit required
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, place, maintain or operate any newsrack which rests in whole or in part upon, in, or on any portion of a public right-of-way or which projects onto, into, or over any part of a public right-of-way in the City without first having obtained a permit from the City Business License Clerk specifying the exact location of such newsrack.

Application for such permit shall be made in writing to the City Business License Clerk upon such form as shall be provided by that department, and shall contain the name and address of the applicant, the proposed specific location of each newsrack and shall be signed by the applicant.

As an express condition of the acceptance of such permit, the permittee thereby agrees to defend, indemnify and save harmless the City, its officers, directors, and employees against any loss or liability or damage including expenses and costs for bodily or personal injury, and for property damage sustained by any person as the result of the installation, use, or maintenance of a newsrack within the City.

Permits shall be issued for the installation of a newsrack or newsracks without prior inspection of the location, but such newsrack or newsracks and the installation, use or maintenance thereof shall be conditioned upon observance of the provisions of this chapter. Permits shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the application has been filed.

9.80.010 Purpose and Intent - Established by Ord. 847, 2006
The City of Norco has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with federal, state, and local laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use; in discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products by minors; in promoting compliance with laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors; and finally, and most importantly, in protecting children from being lured into illegal activity through the misconduct of adults. It is the intent of this ordinance to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to discourage violations of tobacco-related laws, especially those that prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the acts regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed or to alter the penalty provided therefore.

a.    “Arm’s Length Transaction” shall mean: a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this Ordinance is presumed not to be an Arm’s Length Transaction.

b.    “Department” shall mean: County Health Officer or his or her designee.

c.    “Person” shall mean: any natural person, partnership, cooperative association, corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other legal entity.

An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a Person has a ten percent (10%) or greater interest in the stock, assets, or income of a business other than the sole interest of security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed to exist when a Person can or does have, or can or does share, ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business.

e.    “Self-Service Display” shall mean: the open display of Tobacco Products or Tobacco Paraphernalia in a manner that is accessible to the general public without the assistance of the retailer or employee of the retailer. A Vending Machine is a form of Self-Service Display.

f.    “Smoking” shall mean: possessing a lighted Tobacco Product, Tobacco Paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, lighted cigar, or lighted cigarette of any kind), the lighting of a Tobacco Product, Tobacco Paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar, or cigarette of any kind).

a.    It shall be unlawful for any Person to act as a Tobacco Retailer without first obtaining and maintaining a valid Tobacco Retailer’s license pursuant to this Ordinance for each location at which that activity is to occur.

c.    Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to grant any Person obtaining and maintaining a Tobacco Retailer’s license any status or right other than the right to act as a Tobacco Retailer at the location in the County identified on the face of the license.

d.    Application for a Tobacco Retailer’s license shall be submitted in the name of each Proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each Proprietor or an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of each Proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the issuance of a Tobacco Retailer’s license. A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a Proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 9.80.090 of this ordinance.

3.    After three or more violations for a Person within any sixty-month (60) period, no new license may issue for the Person as a Proprietor until five (5) years have passed from the date of last violation.

4.    Each day that a Person engages in Tobacco Retailing without a valid Tobacco Retailers license shall constitute a separate violation.

f.    Tobacco Products and Tobacco Paraphernalia offered for sale or exchange in violation of this ordinance are subject to seizure and forfeiture. Forfeited Tobacco Products and Tobacco Paraphernalia shall be destroyed.

1.    The application is incomplete or inaccurate.

2.    The application seeks authorization for Tobacco Retailing at a location for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to Section 9.80.090 (b) of this ordinance. However, this subparagraph shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if the applicant provides the County with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an Arm’s Length Transaction.

3.    The application seeks authorization for Tobacco Retailing for a Proprietor for which a prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to Section 9.80.090 (b) of this ordinance.

4.    The application seeks authorization for Tobacco Retailing that is prohibited pursuant to 9.80.040 (a) of this ordinance, that is unlawful pursuant to any other County ordinance, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other local, state, or federal law.

9.80.050 Licenses Nontransferable
a.    A Tobacco Retailer’s license is nontransferable. If the information required in the license application pursuant to 9.80.030 (g) 1, 2, or 3 changes, a new Tobacco Retailer’s license is required before the business may continue to act as a Tobacco Retailer. For example, if a Proprietor to whom a license has been issued changes business location, that Proprietor must apply for a new license prior to acting as a Tobacco Retailer at the new location. Or if the business is sold, the new owner must apply for a license for that location before acting as a Tobacco Retailer.

b.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance violations accumulated against a location or business shall continue to be counted against the location or business unless the location or business has been transferred to a new Proprietor and the new Proprietor provides the County with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the new Proprietor has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an Arm’s Length Transaction.

9.80.060 Fees for License
a.    A Tobacco Retailer license is invalid unless the appropriate fee has been paid in full and the term of the license has not expired. The term of a Tobacco Retailer license is one (1) year.

9.80.070 Other Requirements and Prohibitions
a.    DISPLAY OF LICENSE. Each license shall be prominently displayed in a publicly and readily visible location at the licensed location.

9.80.080 License Violation

3.    Compliance checks shall determine, at a minimum, if the Tobacco Retailer is conducting business in a manner that complies with tobacco laws regulating youth access to tobacco. When appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance with other tobacco-related laws.

3.    The County shall not enforce any tobacco-related minimum-age law against a Person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of the Person’s age (hereinafter “Youth Decoy”) if the potential violation occurs when:

i.    the Youth Decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a code enforcement official; or

ii.    the Youth Decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part, either directly or indirectly through sub-contracting, by the county Department of Health and Human Services or funded in part, either directly or indirectly through sub-contracting, by the California Department of Health Services.

This chapter is established pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code Sections 12927(c)(1) and 12955(1) to provide a formal procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of laws, regulations, policies and procedures, and to establish relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests. (Ord. 970 Sec. 1, 2014)

9.95.040 Applicability.
In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, any person may request a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.

A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter applies only to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. (Ord. 970 Sec. 1, 2014)

9.95.060 Application process.
(1)    In order to make housing available to an individual with a disability, an applicant may request a reasonable accommodation in laws, regulations, policies, practices and procedures as regulated by the Norco Municipal Code.

(2)    All requests shall be reasonable and limited to the minimum that the applicant believes is necessary to accommodate the disability. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted via a form approved by the Planning Division, together with the appropriate fee, as established by resolution adopted by the City Council, and shall be filed with the Planning Division. The applicant is requested to provide the following information:

(a)    Name and address of the applicant;

(b)    Name and address of the property owner(s);

(c)    Address of the property for which accommodation is requested;

(e)    Description of the requested accommodation, and the regulation(s), policy or procedure for which accommodation is sought, which could include site plans, floor plans, and/or details as necessary to define the extent of the accommodation;

(f)    The basis for the claim that the fair housing laws apply to the individual(s) with a disability and evidence supporting the claim, which may be in the form of a letter from a medical doctor or other licensed healthcare professional, a handicapped license, or other appropriate evidence;

(g)    Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with the disability to use and enjoy the property; and

(h)    How the property will be used by the applicant and individual(s) with disabilities.

(3)    Any information identified by the applicant as confidential shall be retained by the City in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the individual with a disability and shall not be made available for public inspection.

(4)    A request for reasonable accommodation in regulations, policies, practices and procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an applicant’s obligation to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested reasonable accommodation.

(5)    If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the City will provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible.

(6)    The fee for an application for reasonable accommodation shall be established by resolution of the City Council. (Ord. 970 Sec. 1, 2014)

(a)    Administrative Review. The Planning Director or an appointed designee has the authority to review and decide upon requests for reasonable accommodation, including whether the applicant is a disabled person within the meaning of this chapter.

(b)    City Council Review. The City Council has the authority to review and decide upon requests for reasonable accommodation, including whether the applicant is a disabled person within the meaning of this chapter, when referred by the Planning Director or when a reasonable accommodation request includes any minor deviation from Norco Municipal Code requirements.

(2)    Notice. No advance notice or public hearing is required for consideration of reasonable accommodation requests by the Planning Director. Requests for reasonable accommodation subject to review by the City Council shall require advance notice and a public hearing pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 4.04.

(3)    Decision. The Planning Director or an appointed designee shall render a decision or refer the matter to the City Council within 30 days after the application is complete, and shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application, based on the findings set forth in Section 9.95.100. The decision shall be in writing and mailed to the applicant.

If the application for reasonable accommodation involves another discretionary decision, the reviewing body for that decision shall accept as final the determination regarding reasonable accommodation by the Planning Director or an appointed designee, unless the reasonable accommodation request has been referred by the Planning Director or an appointed designee to the City Council for consideration.

If the application for reasonable accommodation is referred to, or reviewed by, the City Council, a decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application shall be rendered within 20 working days after the close of the public hearing, based on the findings set forth above. (Ord. 970 Sec. 1, 2014)

9.95.100 Findings and decisions.

(e)    The requested reasonable accommodation would not adversely impact surrounding properties or uses.

(f)    There are no reasonable alternatives that would provide an equivalent level of benefit without requiring a modification or exception to the City’s applicable rules, standards and practices.

(2)    In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection (1) of this section. (Ord. 970 Sec. 1, 2014)

10.12.030    Prima facie speed limits.

10.12.010 Intent and purpose.
The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish prima facie speed limits on certain specified streets within the City in order to allow radar or other electronic speed measuring devices to be used for enforcement and citation purposes. It is also intended to establish by use and function some streets as residential in the event they do not meet the specific definition of a residential district within the California Vehicle Code. These clarifications are necessary in consideration of the rural type development, large lot design, lack of sidewalks, and equestrian orientation of the community. (Ord. 963 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 909 Sec. 1, 2009; Ord. 860, 2006; Ord. 807, 2003; Ord. 698, 1995; Ord. 167, 1973; Ord. 99, 1969; Ord. 64, 1966; Ord. 63, 1966)

10.12.020 Justification.
In accordance with the appropriate sections within the California Vehicle Code, engineering and traffic surveys are performed as necessary on streets shown on the functional classification map and not subject to prima facie speed limits contained within the California Vehicle Code as well as those not shown on the map and not meeting the definition of a residential area. The speeds on those street segments surveyed are safe and reasonable and are considered appropriate to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of traffic and the safety and protection of the pedestrian/equestrian segment of the community. (Ord. 963 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 909 Sec. 1, 2009; Ord. 860, 2006; Ord. 807, 2003; Ord. 698, 1995; Ord. 167, 1973; Ord. 99, 1969; Ord. 64, 1966; Ord. 63, 1966)

10.18.090 Displacement of property of public utility.
Whenever the moving of any overload requires the removal or displacement of any wire, lines or other property of any public utility it shall be the duty of the applicant to give notice to the affected public utility and make such payments and guarantees against injury and damages as are required by the public utility.

Upon receipt of such notice, payments and guarantees the affected public utility shall act in an efficient and expeditious manner to remove or displace or cause to be removed or displaced, such wire, lines or other property. (Ord. 179 Sec. 9 1972)

10.18.100 Permit--Issuance.
If at the completion of the investigations required herein, the manager finds and determines that the overload movement as proposed in the application will not be detrimental to the public health, peace, safety and welfare, the manager shall issue to applicant an overload permit subject to such reasonable terms, provisions and conditions as he deems necessary to protect public streets and places or property and lives of any person and the public health, peace, safety and welfare, including but not limited to restricting and limiting the number of movements, the weight, length, width, height and size of any overload, the time of day movements may be made, the date and time periods during which movements may be made, and requiring applicant to obtain written approval of any person whose property or person will be unreasonably disturbed or endangered by applicant moving the proposed overload upon public streets or places. (Ord. 179 Sec. 10, 1972)

10.18.110 Determining time and route for moving overload.
The manager shall determine and approve the times and dates when an overload may be moved, and shall determine and approve the street route or routes in city over which each overload may be moved, giving due consideration among other things to existing underpasses, overhead wires and other obstacles and the condition of the streets. Prescribed street routes shall, whenever possible, be confined to arterial highways and not local streets.

Overloads traveling on a route approved hereunder by the manager shall be exempt from any city truck route regulations including those provisions of Chapter 10.16 of this title. (Ord. 179 Sec. 11, 1972)

10.18.120 Permit--Contents.

Any permit which fails to contain any of the above information or which purports to grant authority to move or not to move any overload contrary to the provisions of this chapter, state of California laws and city ordinances and resolutions is void. Neither the city nor any city officer or employee is liable for any damages resulting to applicant due to such permit failing to contain any of such information.

In the case of annual permits or other permits contemplating the use of more than one vehicle, the permittee may substitute or add thereto vehicles or overloads being moved under such permit upon submission to the manager of the information as required in Section 10.18.070 regarding such vehicles and his approval thereof by written addendum to the permit at least twenty-four hours prior to their move. (Ord. 179 Sec. 12, 1972)

10.18.130 Permit--Carrying on vehicle--Presentation.
Every overload permit, or facsimile thereof, in the case of an annual or other permit which contemplates the use of more than one vehicle, shall be carried in the overload vehicle or by the operator of such vehicle, to which it refers, and shall be presented, upon demand, to any peace officer, duly authorized city law enforcement officer, traffic officer, or any duly authorized agent of the department of the city charged with the care and protection of the city’s public streets and places. (Ord. 179 Sec. 13, 1972)

10.18.140 Permit--Suspension and revocation.
The manager may at any time suspend or revoke a permit issued pursuant to this chapter when he has probable cause to believe a permittee has violated or is causing or permitting a violation of this chapter or any laws of the state of California, county of Riverside and city of Norco ordinances and resolutions or any condition of his overload permit or when it has been shown to his satisfaction that the activities so permitted are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the public health, peace, safety or welfare of the city. The manager may also suspend or revoke any permit hereunder if he has probable cause to believe the permittee, or any agent, official or employee of the permittee has misrepresented, falsified or concealed any material fact in the application therefor. (Ord. 179 Sec. 14, 1972)

10.18.150 Moving overload unescorted--Unlawful when.

(1)    The overload exceeds in width one-half the narrowest roadway over which such overload is being moved; or

(2)    The overload exceeds eighteen feet (two hundred sixteen inches) in width, or eighteen feet (two hundred sixteen inches) in height; or

(3)    The overload exceeds seventy feet over-all in length.

If the manager determines that the proposed movement of such an overload may be made safely, without damage to the public streets or places or injury to persons and property and without undue interference with traffic or the use of the public streets by the public, he may waive the requirements of this section. (Ord. 179 Sec. 15, 1972)

10.18.160 Escort--Deposit for costs.
Every applicant for a permit to move any overload required hereunder to be accompanied by an escort shall deposit with the manager prior to any such movement cash money sufficient to cover the costs of the escort at the rate of twenty dollars for the first four hours or fraction thereof, and five dollars per hour or fraction thereof after the first four hours for the length of time the manager deems necessary for the performance of such escort service. The manager shall deposit all such escort fees with the city treasurer. Upon the completion of the moving of such overload, the manager shall deduct from such total deposit the sum of twenty dollars for the first four hours or fraction thereof, and five dollars for each hour or fraction thereof exceeding the first four hours for the time such escort actually was used by the permittee and shall authorize the director of finance to refund to the permittee any difference between the amount deposited and the amount so deducted. If an amount insufficient to pay the costs of the escort at the above rates was deposited by the permittee, he shall pay to the manager an additional amount of money sufficient to pay for the cost of the escort, the payment to be made to city’s director of finance within forty-eight hours of permittee’s receipt of a statement of the additional costs. (Ord. 179 Sec. 16, 1972)

10.18.170 Escort--Assignment.
When any overload is required to be accompanied by an escort, and a permit has been issued therefor and the deposit for the escort has been paid to the manager, the manager shall assign an escort to accompany the overload. It shall be the duty of the mover of any overload requiring an escort to notify the manager at least twenty-four hours in advance of the time the move is to be started. (Ord. 179 Sec. 17, 1972)

10.18.180 Privately provided escorts.
The escort requirements of Sections 10.18.150, 10.18.160 and 10.18.170 shall not apply if the permittee submits to the manager no later than forty-eight hours prior to the commencement of the proposed movement sufficient evidence of his ability to provide suitable escort and the manager approves such proposed escort by addendum to the permit.

12.04.090    Appeal to city council.

12.04.010 Purpose.
(a)    In enacting this chapter, the city council finds that this city has experienced explosive increases in land development for high-activity purposes, the direct result of which is to rapidly render the previously existing streets and highways inadequate in width and development to provide minimum acceptable service capacity to the lands being developed, and, therefore, the public is being denied streets and highways of minimum standards for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and travel.

(b)    Therefore, the provisions of this chapter are intended officially to define the requirements, policies, and procedures for the acquisition of public improvements of property, in order to:

(1)    Supplement and insure conformity to Title 18, of the Subdivision Map Act and to other applicable requirements of this city, and to extend the basic requirements thereunder, to apply to land development in which no subdivision is involved;

(2)    Spread the cost of required public improvements upon the abutting properties as contemplated by law;

(3)    Protect the vested interest of the public in the pre-existing capacity of city streets and highways, and to provide for private participation in the widening and improvement of streets and highways when the same becomes necessary by reason of development of abutting property; and,

(4)    Protect the public safety and general welfare of the general public.

(c)    Compliance with the requirements provided in this chapter is not intended to relieve anyone from any further and additional obligations with respect to streets imposed by reason of other regulations of city or as may be provided for by agreement with city. (Ord. 85, Sec. 1, 1968; Ord. 56, Sec. 1, 1966)

12.04.020 Street Improvement planning.
The city engineer shall prepare for each city street and prospective city street an improvement plan. Such plan shall reflect the width for streets established by the master plan of highways and the select city streets system and shall state the ultimate planned alignment, grades, pavement requirements, and curb and gutter specifications where such are required by city policy, and shall include all other ultimate improvement plans for each such street. The aforesaid plan of improvement for each street shall be presented to the city council for approval. When approved by action of the city council, the improvement plan for any given city street shall be known as and referred to as the “City Improvement Plan” for such street. (Ord. 85, Sec. 2, 1968; Ord. 59, Sec. 2, 1966)

12.04.030 Construction of curbs, gutters, and paving required--Permit application.
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and subject to the provisions of Section 12.04.040, any person constructing, adding to, or arranging for the construction of, or addition to any off-street parking facilities, or any building in the city, the result of which, in the opinion of the city manager, effects an increase in the density of use of the property or effects an increase of the traffic generation on the street in question, shall also provide for the construction of curbs, gutters, and street paving to meet the existing street pavement, in accordance with the city standard specifications and design along street frontage adjoining the property upon which such work is to be done on California Avenue, Hamner Avenue, North Drive and Sixth Street and on all public streets frontage on intersecting cross streets where the adjoining property is proposed to be used for commercial or industrial uses, unless curbs, gutters, and paving constructed in accordance with city standards and design there for already exist.

(b)    Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the following requirements shall apply to any person constructing, adding to, or arranging for the construction of, any building, or related off-street parking facilities, in the city, the cost of which exceeds one thousand dollars and the result of which action, in the opinion of the city manager, effects an increase in the density of use of the property or effects an increase in the traffic generated on related streets, or the location of which is such that the total effect of all such existing and anticipated construction and additions along adjacent and nearby streets is expected to result in any increase in the traffic on the existing and prospective city streets providing access to the location of such construction or addition. As a condition precedent to being granted a permit, any such person shall either arrange for the immediate construction of the following accessory street improvements, or, as provided in Section 12.04.040, shall obtain the city’s written consent to a delay in the construction of the following accessory street improvements:

(1)    Existing public streets other than those referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. If the real property on which the improvement or addition is to be constructed is contiguous to a dedicated public street, curbs, gutters and pavement to city improvement plan requirements shall be installed along the portion of the street that is contiguous to such real property unless such improvements meeting city improvement plan requirements shall already exist at all points along the contiguous portion of such street;

(2)    Prospective city street locations. If some portion of the real property on which the proposed improvement or addition is to be made constitutes the planned right-of-way for a future city street and has been designated by the city council to be a “Prospective City Street,” curbs, gutters and pavement to city improvement plan requirements shall be installed along all of the length of such prospective city street that is situated on the real property to which the proposed improvement or addition is appurtenant;

(3)    Private streets and driveways. If the principal structure to which such improvement, construction, or addition relates, or is accessory, is situated more than one hundred feet from the nearest dedicated public street, there shall be provided concrete or asphaltic paved access to such principal structure along and through the lot or other property to which the aforesaid principal structure is appurtenant. Such paved access shall be installed along a centerline and grade established by the city upon application of the person undertaking the improvement or addition on the property. The width of such paved access shall be not less than eighteen feet. The paving shall be constructed to the city’s equivalent specifications for dedicated residential public streets.

(c)    A street improvement permit for any street improvements or dedications required by this chapter shall be applied for in accordance with and shall be subject to the provisions of all applicable laws in addition to the special provisions provided in this chapter. Where appropriate under this chapter, a delay as provided in Section 12.04.040 shall be granted, an agreement as provided in Section 12.04.040 shall be entered into with the city, and a dedication shall be agreed to as provided in Section 12.04.060, prior to or in conjunction with the issuance of any building permits or other permits for the property. A street improvement fee, the amount of which shall be determined from time to time by the city council, shall be paid by each applicant for a permit as a condition precedent to such permit. (Ord. 100 Sec. 1, 1969; Ord. 85 Sec. 3, 1968; Ord. 59 Sec. 3, 1966)

(1)    Where the city engineer finds and determines that area drainage facilities are inadequate and that the installation of all or a portion of the required public improvements would endanger the public welfare by reason thereof; or,

(2)    Where the city engineer determines that it would be in the best interest of the city to cause all or a portion of the required work to be done on an area project basis rather than on an individual basis; or,

(3)    Where the city manager finds and determines that such requirements, as applied to an individual property, by reason of exceptional or extraordinary situations or conditions affecting the property, or the location thereof, or of the use or development of property in the immediate vicinity of the property, will involve practical difficulties, or would cause undue hardship, unnecessary to carry out the purpose and spirit of this chapter.

Such delay shall not be granted or become effective unless an agreement between the property owner and the city is properly executed agreeing:

(A)    That at the city’s written request the property owner will complete the construction of the improvements otherwise required by these regulations within ninety days thereafter,

(B)    That the owner shall deposit cash with the city treasurer, or will give a bond satisfactory to the city, in an amount set by the city engineer equivalent to the estimated costs of such improvements and enforcement of the agreement, guaranteeing that the owner will faithfully perform all the terms of the agreement.

(b)    A delay in the application of subparagraph (1) of paragraph (b) of Section 12.04.030 in requiring certain improvements to be installed immediately on public streets in conjunction with improvements to the abutting property shall be granted at such time as the applicant-owner and the city have entered into a properly executed agreement providing:

(1)    That at the city’s written request the property owner will complete the construction of the improvements otherwise required by these regulations within ninety days thereafter;

(2)    That the applicant-owner shall deposit cash with the city treasurer, or will give a bond satisfactory to the city, in an amount set by the city engineer equivalent to the estimated costs of such improvements and enforcement of the agreement, guaranteeing that the owner will faithfully perform all the terms of the agreement.

D.    If there is a trench-related failure after the City of Norco reconstructs, repaves, or resurfaces the street, the owner of the facility/utility company is responsible for its repair if the failure occurs within one year of a trench repair.

E.    When the City of Norco determines that an excavation or a defect is hazardous or constitutes a public nuisance or other imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare, the Department of Public Works may order the responsible party to remedy the condition immediately. If the responsible party refuses or fails to make the needed repairs immediately, the City of Norco will make the repairs and:

1.    The responsible party will be charged all the actual costs including administration, construction, consultant fees, equipment, inspection, notification, and remediation made necessary by the action or inaction of the permittee.

Every such permit shall be revocable and the uses and installations thereunder shall be subordinate to any prior right of the city to use the right-of-way for public street purposes. Every such permit shall be conditioned upon the right of the city to require the permittee to relocate or remove the structure or encroachment at the permittee’s expense for the benefit of the city or to relocate the structure or encroachment at the permittee’s expense, wherein the opinion of the city superintendent of streets such action is reasonably necessary to avoid a crossing conflict, for the benefit of any public district, public agency or political subdivision or of any other person or agency having a right to use the city streets for the purpose proposed; but the acceptance of a permit shall not be deemed a waiver by the permittee of any contractual or statutory right against any party for reimbursement of the expense of such removal or re location. Every such permit shall be subject to such conditions as the superintendent of streets determines are necessary to assure the safety of the traveling public and the restoration of service of the street and the foundations thereof, and of the portions outside the traveled roadway. The city superintendent of streets may require such surety bond or deposit of money as in his judgment may be necessary to secure performance of the conditions of the permit and the replacement and restoration of the surface and the subsurface of the street and the right-of-way, and any survey monuments or other improvements that may have been disturbed. The superintendent of streets may, where convenient to road work he has programmed or for other reasons of city convenience, arrange to do the work of replacement to pavement or restoration of the roadway at the expense of the permittee. If any permittee fails to refill any excavation or to restore the city street or right-of-way to its condition prior to the excavation, the city superintendent of streets shall have the right to perform the work and collect in the name of the city the cost thereof. (Ord. 37 Sec. 2, 1965)

12.08.021 Prohibitions.
In order to provide a walkway for pedestrian traffic, no encroachment permit shall be granted to construct a fence or similar structure within four feet of the curb line of any street located in the RI zone. The superintendent of streets shall require the walkway to be kept free and clear of any and all obstructions and shall allow only the planting of grass therein. (Ord. 261 Sec. 2 (part), 1973)

12.08.030 Exceptions.
An excavation or encroachment may be made without first obtaining a permit for repair or replacement of a facility previously installed only when necessary for the immediate protection or preservation of a life or property, and provided that such a permit is obtained on the first business day thereafter, and further provided that the excavation is made in such manner as to give full protection to the users of such street and the city. (Ord. 37 Sec. 3, 1965)

12.08.040 Tree removal.
No person, firm, corporation, public district, public agency or political subdivision shall remove or severely trim any tree planted in the right-of-way of any city street without first obtaining a permit from the superintendent of streets to do so. Such permit shall be issued without fee, if the city superintendent of streets is satisfied that such removal or trimming is in the public interest or is necessary for the improvement of the right-of-way or the construction of improvements on adjacent land. He may impose such conditions as he deems reasonable or necessary, including requirements for the work to be done only by a qualified tree surgeon or tree trimmer actually engaged in that business, and for bond, insurance or other security to protect person and property from injury or damage. The provisions limiting trimming of trees shall not apply to any public utility maintaining overhead power or communication lines pursuant to franchise, where necessary to prevent interference of a tree with such installation. A permit for removal of a tree may be conditioned upon its relocation or replacement by one or more other trees of a kind or type to be specified in the permit. (Ord. 37 Sec. 4, 1965)

12.08.050 Application.
Each application for a permit under this chapter shall be in writing in the name of the person or agency owning the encroachment and controlling the excavation and shall be signed by such person or agency, or by his or its agent authorized in writing. The application shall be submitted on a form supplied by the city superintendent of streets and shall contain or be accompanied by such Information as he may require. Each permit shall be written on a form furnished and signed by the superintendent of streets or his duly authorized representative and shall specify and/or refer to the conditions of granting such permit including the condition that such permit shall be recorded in the office of the recorder for Riverside County. (Ord. 261 Sec. 2 (part), 1973: Ord 37 Sec. 5, 1965)

12.08.060 Fees.
The permit fees and inspection fees required by this chapter shall be paid at or after the time the application is filed, but in any event before the permit is issued. The fees for permits, which shall not be refundable, and for inspections shall be established by Resolution of the City Council.

A series of concurrent excavations in the same immediate neighborhood involving a single inspection procedure shall be considered a single excavation for the purpose of determining the inspection fee;

The Director of Public Works may waive the inspection fee when in his opinion the public safety or convenience does not require inspection of an excavation or encroachment. (Ord. 665, 1993; Ord. 37 Sec. 6, 1965)

12.08.070 Exemptions.
A.    The following shall be exempted from payment of the permit fee for an excavation or encroachment:

12.12.010 Intent and purpose.
The City recognizes the economic, environmental and aesthetic importance of the trees and plantings within the community. It shall be the City’s policy to utilize applicable techniques, methods and procedures required to preserve, when feasible, all trees and plantings on City property. This chapter is part of a comprehensive plan developed in the best interest of the Norco community to regulate the planting and maintenance of trees in or adjacent to streets and within easements, in rights-of-way and other public places within the City, to provide for orderly development and protection of public facilities, and to regulate the removal of trees that contribute significantly to the value of land, preservation of resources, and quality of life in the City of Norco.

The purpose of this chapter is to assure that a single tree species on any given street will be planted, maintained, trimmed, and replaced if damaged, in a uniform manner to develop a consistent and formal streetscape, providing a canopy effect appropriate to the nature of development adjacent to the street. The installation, maintenance and replacement standards established in this section are intended to implement an effective urban forestry program to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

(Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.015 Definitions.
A.    “Approved street tree” shall mean any tree hereafter planted within any street right-of-way or easement adjacent thereto which conforms to the Approved Street Tree List and which is planted in accordance with this chapter. “Approved street tree” shall also mean any existing tree within the right-of-way or easement adjacent thereto which conforms to the established species and location in any given area, and which was planted as a required street tree under the provisions of any improvement agreement, or as otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works, or any tree of the approved species and in an acceptable location which was or may be planted as a replacement.

B.    “Approved Street Tree List” is a list that shall be maintained by the Public Works Department containing the botanical and common names of all trees authorized to be planted in the public right-of-way or tree planting easements. The list may be revised to include other suitable trees, trees to be planted for evaluation purposes, or to exclude trees deemed to be unsuitable.

C.    “Maintenance” shall mean planting, pruning, staking, cabling, treating for pests and disease, removing, or any other act that nurtures the street tree population, sustains tree life and health, and promotes public safety.

D.    “Other plantings” shall mean any trees, shrubs, grass or ground cover other than public landscaping, planted within street right-of-way or easements or in proximity thereto, or on adjoining property.

E.    “Owner/occupant” shall mean any person owning property, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll for City taxes, or the lessee tenant, or other person having control or possession of the property.

F.    “Tree pruning” shall refer to the removal of diseased, dead, dying, decayed, interfering or obstructing branches, or the training of young trees to control growth and enhance performance or function in the landscape, and by developing and preserving tree structure, health and stability. No more than 25 percent of the tree canopy should be removed within a growing season.

G.    “Street tree planting” shall mean the planting of City street trees within the public right-of-way, in parks and in easements dedicated to tree planting. Street trees shall be planted in residential neighborhoods within tree planting easements in suitable vacant planting sites, which avoid conflicts with underground utilities and hardscapes.

H.    “Tree removal” means either (1) complete removal, such as cutting a tree to the ground and grinding the stump; or (2) taking any action that would lead to the death of a tree or cause permanent damage that may compromise tree health and stability. Tree removal may include, but shall not be limited to, severe pruning or topping, poisoning, over-watering, under-watering, trenching, excavating, or altering the soil grade around the tree trunk.

I.    “Tree topping” is the removal of large branches to a stub, or smaller lateral not large enough to assume a terminal role. Tree topping is not an approved tree pruning practice for City street trees or protected trees, and is considered tree removal under this chapter.

J.    “Unapproved street tree” shall mean any tree planted within street right-of-way or easements or in proximity thereto, or on adjoining property, which does not qualify as an approved street tree. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017)

12.12.020 General provisions—Installation and maintenance.
A.    The purpose of this chapter is to preserve parkway trees, to regulate the maintenance and removal of such trees, and to establish the varieties, minimum size, methods, and location for the planting thereof, and other related matters.

B.    The City Council, by resolution, shall establish an Approved Street Tree List containing the botanical and common names of all trees authorized to be planted in the public right-of-way or tree planting easements adjacent thereto. The list shall be reviewed periodically by the Public Works Department and the Streets, Trails and Utilities Commission, and may be modified by recommendation to the City Council.

C.    The Streets, Trails and Utilities Commission shall be tasked with recommending the appropriate species or variety of tree planted within the public street right-of-way or established street or access easements as specified in the Urban Forest Specifications and Standards.

D.    Street trees shall be planted in conformance with the adopted street tree resolution and in accordance with departmental standard specifications.

E.    A working manual entitled “Urban Forest Specifications and Standards” illustrating the standards established herein shall be maintained and updated periodically by the Public Works Department for use by employees and for distribution to developers and builders.

F.    The Director of Public Works shall be responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of this chapter. He or she shall undertake maintenance and planting programs and controls as may be required to carry out the provisions of this chapter consistent with facilities and resources available. He or she may designate certain representatives to administer any portion of this chapter. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.025 Planting of trees, removal, and replacement.
A.    Consistent with the availability of resources, the Public Works Department shall initiate and administer a program to provide for the planting, maintenance, care, removal, and replacement of approved street trees.

B.    Except for an emergency, which shall be an imminent threat of injury to persons or property, a tree may not be removed without the review and approval of the Director of Public Works or his/her representative.

C.    Trees with attributes most appropriate to their location and surroundings will be selected by the Director of Public Works or his/her representative from the Approved Street Tree List. Trees planted in the public right-of-way and tree planting easements shall conform to the City street tree planting standard detail.

D.    The current resident, or if there is no current resident, then the owner shall be responsible for the adequate watering and protection of City street trees in tree planting easements.

E.    It shall be unlawful for any person to plant or remove any tree in any public right-of-way without first obtaining a written permit from the Public Works Department. Said permit shall specify the location and variety of trees or plants to be planted or removed.

F.    Street trees or other plantings that are required to be planted by a subdivider or developer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the City may be planted without a permit; provided, however, that such trees and plantings shall conform to City-approved plans and specifications and shall be planted under the supervision of the Public Works Department. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017)

12.12.030 Tree installation standards.
A.    Unless otherwise specified, all trees shall be furnished in 15-gallon containers. The trees shall be of the size normally expected for commercially available nursery stock of 15-gallon size for the required species. Diameters shall be measured six inches above the crown root. The caliper of the tree must be between an inch and one and one-half inches in diameter and the height of the tree will not exceed eight feet, and the width three feet. All trees shall be in a healthy growing condition at the time of planting and shall be approved by the Director of Public Works or his/her representative at the site prior to planting.

B.    All plants shall be healthy, have a normal configuration and be well rooted. The roots shall show no evidence of having been restricted, free from insect pests, and grown in nurseries which have been inspected by the State Department of Agriculture. All plants shall be Number One grade of their normal species or variety unless otherwise specified. They shall have normal, well developed branch systems and vigorous root systems. Plants shall be free from disfiguring knots, injuries, abrasions of the bark, sun scalding or other objectionable disfigurements. Plants not conforming to the requirements herein shall be considered as defective, and such plants, whether in place or not, will be marked as rejected and shall be removed immediately and replaced with suitable plants.

C.    All trees shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works or his/her representative for review and approval prior to installation. Where required, street encroachment permits shall be obtained from the City prior to installation.

D.    The installing contractor shall guarantee all trees for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. Irrigation systems will be required. The Director of Public Works or his/her representative must approve the design and make of these systems. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.040 Installation.
A.    All trees shall be planted in accordance with spacing and location designated on the plans or in the special provisions or as directed by the Director of Public Works or his/her representative.

B.    Holes for planting trees shall be excavated four times the rootball diameter. The holes should never be deeper than the rootball. Soft fill dirt should not be added to the bottom of the hole. Trees should be planted slightly shallow, one to two inches of the rootball higher than the original grade. The exposed ball should be covered with two to four inches of mulch.

C.    The hole shall be backfilled with the same soil that came out of the hole. No soil amendments will be added.

D.    The soil around the ball shall be worked so that no air pockets are left. (Large pockets of air can cause the roots to dry out.) The soil around the ball will be firmed so that the tree is vertical and adequately supported, but the soil will not be packed down. The hole will be watered while it is backfilled. In nonturf areas, the remaining soil will be mounded into a dike on the outer edge of the hole to collect water over the root zone. All tags or labels shall be removed so that they will not girdle the trunk or branches as the tree grows.

E.    When planted, the tree shall be staked in the manner prescribed by the City. Parkway trees shall be planted at approximately 40-foot intervals and shall maintain a minimum distance of ten feet from any utility, meter, sewer lateral, streetlight standard or fire hydrant within the parkway. All trees shall maintain a minimum distance of 25 feet from a drive apron, corner, or intersection.

F.    Trees shall be planted in line with the existing trees, or midway between the back of the curb and the near edge of the equestrian trail or standard sidewalk. If a curb, trail and/or sidewalk has not been constructed, trees shall be planted on a line equivalent thereto, or as directed by the Director of Public Works or his/her representative.

G.    Trees shall be planted with the ball of earth surrounding the roots intact. Containers shall be removed without injury to roots and without breaking the ball of earth surrounding the roots. Root-bound trees will be rejected.

H.    No person shall remove or relocate any tree or plant without prior authorization and permit from the Director of Public Works or his/her representative. Any tree removed without permission from the City shall be replaced by the violator with a new tree at the discretion of the Director of Public Works. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 722, 2001)

12.12.050 Staking and tying of trees.
A.    All 15-gallon trees shall be held vertically with two eight- or 10-foot lodgepole stakes. Stakes will be two-inch lodgepole pine treated with copper naphthenate. A rubber or vinyl cinch tie or approved equal shall be nailed to the stakes with roof nails. Hoses or wires shall not be used for tying. Ties shall be placed six inches above the top flex point on the tree trunk.

B.    Trunks of trees shall be secured to hold the trees upright without injury for a period of 12 months from date of installment. The method of staking and tying shall be as approved by the Director of Public Works or his/her representative. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.060 Trimming and pruning of trees.
A.    Following the planting of trees, pruning should be limited. Broken or damaged limbs should be removed. Some limbs can be removed for structural stability or appearance as necessary.

B.    It shall be unlawful for any person, other than City personnel, to trim any approved street tree without first obtaining a permit from the Public Works Department. The permit shall be issued when the Public Works Department finds that pruning is necessary and that the proposed method is satisfactory. A permit is not required for removing sucker growth, watersprouts, or low hanging branches lower than eight feet from the ground. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.070 Watering of trees after installation.
Proper watering is the key to survival of newly planted trees. A slow, gentle soaking of the root zone is preferable. Excess water accumulation in the planting hole is a leading cause of transplant death. Watering must be appropriate for soil type and drainage. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.12.080 Maintenance and guarantee of trees.
A.    The builder/developer shall maintain all trees until maintenance is assumed by the City and further, the builder/developer shall guarantee all trees for a period of one year after the acceptance of the improvements by the City, and shall replace in kind all trees that have died or which have failed to show visible signs of root establishment and growth during said one-year period. The Director of Public Works or his/her representative shall inspect each tree at the end of the one-year period and report to the builder/developer as to the acceptability of each tree planted. Unacceptable trees shall be replaced. Upon completion of such inspection and any required replacement, the City shall accept the trees for maintenance by the City, excluding watering. The one-year warranty guarantees the public improvements for a one-year period after City acceptance and shall include an amount to be determined by the Director of Public Works to cover the replacement of trees at the end of the one-year period.

B.    It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to water all trees located in a parkway abutting his/her property as necessary to promote healthy growth, to protect the improvements within the parkway, and to do such trimming as can be done from the ground to preserve the neat appearance and unobstructed use of the parkway.

C.    Sucker growth, water sprouts and young overhanging branches on mature trees may be removed to a height of eight feet by the owner/occupant.

D.    The City shall be responsible for all maintenance of median divider parkways and shall be responsible for all major pruning or other tree surgery and the control and treatment of insect pests and disease as funds are available. (Ord. 1024 Sec. 1, 2017; Ord. 772, 2001; Ord. 567 Sec. 1 (part), 1986)

12.18.010 Public right-of-way maintenance purpose and intent.
The city council of the city of Norco hereby enacts the following policy regarding responsibilities for the maintenance of the public right-of-way including trail areas. Normally, the private property owner is responsible for the maintenance of the entire area between the edge of the street pavement or curb line and the property line and its condition in terms of being clean, well-kept and free of hazards. The city council in determining this policy, however, recognizes that unique circumstances apply to the city of Norco and therefore adopts the following policy regarding public right-of-way maintenance. (Ord. 898 Sec. 1, 2008)

12.18.020 Public right-of-way maintenance responsibilities.
1.    Private Property Owner. The private property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance behind the back of curb or edge of street pavement, including the parkway and trail between the street and the property line, in terms of cleanliness and reporting to the city safety and health hazards. The private property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and watering of trees within the tree parkway, with the exception of trimming trees within the public right-of-way. Lastly, the private property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the entire public right-of-way in terms of keeping it free from weeds and debris.

2.    City of Norco. The city shall assume the responsibility from the private property owner for the trimming of trees within the public right-of-way on an as-needed basis. The city shall be responsible for grading and excavation of decomposed granite within the trail area only. Lastly, the city shall be responsible for the repair and/or replacement of damaged city-owned trail fence areas or sections. (Ord. 898 Sec. 1, 2008)

12.18.030 Side and back yard trails.
The private property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of side and back yard trails which are adjacent to his/her property in terms of keeping them clean and free of weeds and debris. Further, in those cases where the trail adjoins two properties, each adjoining property owner shall be responsible for one-half of the trail area adjacent to his/her house. (Ord. 898 Sec. 1, 2008)

12.18.040 Exceptions.
This policy statement does not apply to the maintenance of public right-of-way within landscape maintenance districts where provisions have already been made for the orderly maintenance of the public right-of-way including trails, trees and landscaping. (Ord. 898 Sec. 1, 2008)

12.18.050 Penalties for noncompliance.
Failure to comply with this chapter shall subject the subject property owner to the general penalties set forth in Chapter 1.04 and to administrative citations pursuant to Chapter 1.05 of the Norco Municipal Code. (Ord. 898 Sec. 1, 2008)

13.08.010 Statement of policy.
The city council finds that the public interest requires that all facilities and wires for supplying and distributing electrical energy and service, including telephone, telegraph, and cable television service, to be constructed in the city shall be installed underground for the following reasons:

(1)    Underground installation reduces hazards to the motoring public, fire fighters and construction personnel using booms and cranes;

(2)    Underground installation reduces the dangers of electrocution, fires, and property damages resulting from wind, rain, and electrical storms;

(3)    Underground installation tends to reduce the frequency of interruptions of vitally needed public services;

(4)    Underground installation enhances and preserves the natural beauty and rural environment of the city. (Ord. 230 Sec. 1, 1972)

13.08.020 Required.
All facilities and wires for supplying and distributing electrical energy and service, including telephone, telegraph, and cable television service to be constructed in the city for direct service to subdivisions, building sites and structures shall be installed underground.

13.08.030 Exceptions.
For the purpose of this chapter underground installation shall not be required for:

(1)    Transmission lines of forty thousand volt capacity and above;

(2)    Structures where there is an existing overhead service of a utility; provided, however, that at such time as the utilities in the entire area are placed underground, this exception shall no longer apply. (Ord. 230 Sec. 3, 1972)

13.08.040 Waiver of requirements.
Upon a showing by the property owner or a public utility that underground installation of wires is physically impracticable because of crossing of street, underground obstacles or adverse soil, water or geologic conditions, the city council may waive the undergrounding requirements of this chapter to the extent necessary to avoid circumstances of physical impracticability. (Ord. 230 Sec. 4, 1972)

13.08.050 Technical advisory committee.
There is established a five member technical advisory committee, to be appointed by the city council, for the purpose of considering technical day-to-day problems and to develop recommendations for policy, rules and regulations. One member of this committee shall be a representative of the local serving utility. (Ord. 230 Sec. 5, 1972)

5.    Social security number and/or driver’s license;

6.    Customer’s mailing address and contact number;

7.    Whether applicant is owner, tenant of, or agent for the premises;

8.    Legal owner information;

9.    Information to establish credit of applicant;

10.    Such other information as the Utility Billing may reasonably require.

The application is a request for service and does not in itself bind the Water Utility to serve, except under its adopted rate schedules, nor does it bind the customer to take service for a longer period than the minimum requirements of the rate schedule.

All new accounts will be assessed a one-time “new account setup fee” as specified in the adopted fee resolution.

B.    Individual Liability for Joint Service. Two or more persons who join in one application or contract for service shall be jointly and severally liable thereunder and shall be billed by means of a single periodic bill mailed to the person designated on the application to receive the bill.

C.    Owner/Renter Liability. In the event any fees and other charges due from any occupant for any customer class, as provided for in this section, should become due and payable and fall delinquent, the owner or owners of the premises, whether or not other than the occupant, shall forthwith be jointly and severally liable for the payment of all such fees and charges which have fallen delinquent. For this reason, the owner of the property must provide written authorization to the renter to sign up for service using the appropriate form provided by the Utility Billing.

D.    Change in Customer’s Equipment or Operations. Customers shall give the Water Utility written notice of the extent and nature of any material change in the size or character of the plumbing, equipment, or operations for which the Water Utility is supplying service before making any such change.

E.    Deposit. The Water Utility’s deposit policy is designed to assess the credit risk associated with all customer applications for new or continued service, while protecting the assets of the Water Utility. No Water Utility service shall be provided to any applicant for the commencement of such services or for the restoration of such services until said applicant has paid to Utility Billing a deposit in the amount specified in the adopted fee resolution. Said deposit shall be made in the form of cash, money order, credit, or debit unless waived by the Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative.

Said deposit shall be retained by Utility Billing until the water services have been terminated by the customer or by Utility Billing for nonpayment of billings for services within the time established by appropriate City of Norco ordinances and resolutions. Upon the termination of said services, Utility Billing shall credit the deposit toward any outstanding billing due and owing, by the applicant, for any or all services. After Utility Billing has made such credit, if there be such, that portion of the deposit not so credited shall be refunded to the applicant. The Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative may waive all or a portion of the deposit at his/her discretion.

Residential customers may request a refund of any deposit held on their account after a period of 18 months. Said refund will only be granted if the customer had a payment history that was on time and without any delinquent fees for 18 consecutive billing periods. The deposits for all other customer classifications are not eligible for a refund until the account is closed.

F.    Change of Address. Water service shall not be provided to any customer upon change of address until all delinquent charges owing thereon at a former place of residence or business have been paid.

G.    Other Conditions of Service. Before water service can be provided by the Water Utility, the customer shall obtain any approval of facilities furnished or installed by customer which may be required by the Building Department or the Fire Department of the City of Norco or any other authority whose approval is required by law.

H.    Pressure and Service Conditions. The signing of an application for a water connection or for water service shall be prima facie acceptance and consent to such conditions of pressure and service as may from time to time exist, under the current operating practice prevailing on the water system of the Water Utility. The applicant thereby agrees to hold the Water Utility harmless from any and all damage caused by or arising out of low or high fluctuating pressure or interruption of service. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.040 Contracts.
A.    Service Requiring Contracts. Contracts, other than applications, may be required prior to service, under the following conditions:

1.    Where required by provisions in these rules and regulations.

2.    When a main extension to be made under the provisions of Section 14.04.150 is subject to refunds.

3.    For temporary service not covered under the provisions of Section 14.04.130.

4.    For any service to be furnished at rates or under conditions other than the rates and conditions contained in these rules and regulations.

5.    When service is requested to supply a premises situated at such an elevation that it cannot be assured of a water supply at adequate pressure, water service shall not be furnished until the property owners of record execute an agreement to accept such water service as the Water Utility is able to furnish from its existing distribution system and provide any additional facilities required by any applicable law or plumbing code.

6.    For connections with other water utilities.

7.    For special standby service.

B.    Contract. Contracts shall become effective only after authorization by the Department of Public Works and City Attorney’s office. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.050 Establishments of rates, fees, charges and deposits.
As stated in various sections of this chapter, the City Council shall establish and approve all rates, fees, charges, and deposits by resolution and within proper public notification guidelines as required by Federal or State rules and regulations. A copy of all current rates, fees, charges, and deposits shall be provided upon request and listed on the City’s website. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.060 Establishment and reestablishment of credit.
A.    Establishment of Credit—All Classes of Service. Each applicant for Water Utility service shall be required to satisfactorily establish credit which will be deemed established upon qualifying under any one of the following:

1.    If applicant makes a deposit to secure payment of bills for service as prescribed in Section 14.04.070.

2.    If applicant furnished a guarantor, satisfactory to Utility Billing, to secure payment of bills for service requested.

3.    If applicant’s credit is otherwise established to the satisfaction of Utility Billing.

B.    Establishment and Reestablishment of Credit.

1.    An applicant who previously has been a customer of the Water Utility and whose service has been discontinued by Utility Billing during the past 12 months of that prior service because of nonpayment of bills may be required to reestablish credit by depositing the amounts prescribed in Section 14.04.070 for that purpose, and by paying utility bills regularly due.

2.    A customer who fails to pay bills before they become past due as prescribed in Section 14.04.110(A), and who further fails to pay such bills by the date indicated on either the automated “discontinuance of service” phone notice or the notice deposited in any Unites States postal office box for nonpayment of bills, may be required to pay said bills and reestablish credit by depositing the amount prescribed in Section 14.04.070. This rule will apply regardless of whether or not service has been discontinued for such nonpayment.

3.    A customer may be required to reestablish credit in accordance with subsection (A) of this section in case the conditions of service or basis on which credit was originally established have, in the opinion of Utility Billing, materially changed. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.070 Deposits.
A.    General.

1.    No water service shall be provided to any applicant for the commencement of such services or for the restoration of such services until said applicant has paid to Utility Billing a deposit.

2.    No water service shall be provided until the applicant has established financial responsibility to the satisfaction of the City’s Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative. This can be accomplished by providing the following:

a.    Non-interest-bearing deposit established by the adopted fee resolution;

b.    Letter from a California department provider indicating one or more years of satisfactory payment history;

c.    A prior account with the City of Norco within the previous two years with satisfactory payment history.

B.    Amount of Deposit.

1.    The amount of deposit for a “new account” shall be as specified in the adopted fee resolution.

2.    In case the new service requested is for a vacant property that is for sale or between rental tenants, the owner of listing party shall pay a deposit amount listed as deposit for “clean and show” in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

3.    The Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative can establish additional financial responsibility requirements for individual accounts which had late penalties or have had service discontinued.

4.    The Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative may waive all or a portion of the deposit at his/her discretion.

C.    Method of Payment. Deposit shall be made in the form of cash, money order, debit or credit card unless waived by the Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative.

D.    Return of Deposit. Residential customers may request a refund of any deposit held on their account after a period of 18 months. Said refund will only be granted if the customer had a payment history that was made in full, on time, and without any fees for 18 consecutive billing periods. The deposits for all other customer classifications are not eligible for a refund until the account is closed.

E.    Interest on Deposits. There shall be no interest paid on deposits collected by the Utility Billing.

F.    Deposits for Temporary Service. Deposit requirements for temporary service shall be specified in Section 14.04.130, Temporary Service. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.080 Notices.
A.    Notices to Customers. When notices from Utility Billing to a customer are required, they will normally be given in writing, either mailed to the customer’s mailing address or hand delivered; by automated phone notification or posted in the local newspaper of record; except that in emergencies, the Water Utility may give notices in the manner most suitable under the existing conditions (radio, television, telephone, etc.).

B.    Notice from Customers. Notices from a customer to the Utility Billing may be given by written communication mailed to Utility Billing or City Clerk’s office. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.090 Rendering and payment of bills.
A.    Rendering of Bills.

1.    Billing Period. Bills for water service will be rendered monthly via the utility bill, or as otherwise provided in the rate schedules. The Finance Officer may change the billing period for customers if such change is considered in the best interests of the Water Utility.

2.    Metered Service.

a.    Bills for metered service will be based on meter registrations. Meters will be read as required for the preparation of regular bills, opening bills, and closing bills. Monthly bills will be prepared based on meter readings that are collected every 28 to 32 days.

b.    Estimated Meter Reading. If, because of unusual conditions or for reasons beyond its control, Utility Billing is unable to read the customer’s meter on the scheduled reading date, Utility Billing may bill the customer for estimated consumption during the billing period and make any necessary corrections when a reading is obtained. Estimated consumption for this purpose will be calculated considering the customer’s average prior usage over the past 12 billing periods, and the general characteristics of the customer’s operations. Adjustments for any underestimate or overestimate of a customer’s consumption will be reflected on the next regularly scheduled bill rendered and based on the actual reading following the period of estimated consumption. If the cause for Utility Billing’s inability to read the meter is because of inaccessibility, then access to the meter sufficient to it being read shall be provided by the customer as a prerequisite to Utility Billing making any adjustment of water consumption billed on an estimated basis.

c.    Adjustments for Billing Error. When it is found that an error in billing has occurred due to a Utility Billing error, the date of which can be reliably established, the overcharge or the undercharge will be computed back to such date; provided, however, that adjustment of Water Utility billing errors shall be limited to the immediate preceding four-month period.

3.    Pro Rata Computation. When the total period of service is less than 28 days, pro-rations will be made for the Water Service Charge. The Water Usage Charge shall be billed based on the closing reading of the water meter.

B.    Readings of Separate Meters Not Combined. For the purpose of billing, each meter upon the customer’s premises will be considered separately, and the readings of two or more metered services will not be combined, except as follows:

1.    Where combinations of meter readings are specifically provided for in the rate schedules.

2.    Where the Water Utility’s operating convenience requires the use of more than one meter per service connection.

C.    Payment of Bills.

1.    All bills are due and payable on or before the due date shown on the bill. Payment shall be made to the City of Norco.

2.    Charges for reconnection of service, and payments of deposits or payments to reinstate deposits as required under these rules and regulations, shall be paid before service will be reconnected.

3.    If payment of a bill is not received by Utility Billing’s office on or before the due date, a “late charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council will be added to the total amount due.

D.    Returned Check Charge. Utility Billing shall require a charge for any check returned from the bank unpaid. The amount of said charge shall be per the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

E.    Check Read Charge. When a customer requests that Utility Billing verify the accuracy of the read as shown on the bill, Utility Billing shall charge a “check read charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council for sending a field representative to the service address to obtain another reading of the meter. Such charge shall be added to the customer’s next regularly scheduled water bill. If said check read shows that the previous read is in error, no “check read charge” would be imposed. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.100 Disputed bills.
A.    Billed Water Consumption.

1.    A customer who believes that the water consumption portion of the utility bill is in error must first contact Utility Billing by phone or in writing before the due date on the bill stating the nature of their dispute. Utility Billing shall contact the customer within 10 days from the date the dispute is received with a determination. Once a determination has been provided by Utility Billing the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from Utility Billing’s determination if the due date has already expired.

B.    Disputed Water Bill Appeal.

1.    If the customer is not satisfied with the determination by Utility Billing, the customer may formally appeal the disputed bill in question to the Director of Public Works for review by submitting a written statement setting forth the reasons why the customer believes the bill is incorrect. The customer must submit the appeal within seven days of the initial dispute determination to the Director of Public Works, City of Norco, 2870 Clark Ave, Norco, California 92860. However, in order to have the disputed bill considered by the Director of Public Works, the customer must submit a payment equal to the customer’s most recent paid utility bill to Utility Billing (payable to the City of Norco). Upon timely receipt of the written statement and payment, the Director of Public Works or his/her designee will review the basis of the billed amount, and communicate the results of the review and determination to the customer. Once a determination has been provided by the Director of Public Works the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from the Director of Public Works determination if the due date has already expired.

A customer who formally disputes the accuracy of the water consumption portion of a utility bill will not have the water service discontinued for nonpayment and will not be responsible for any late fees that may occur during the review period. If, before completion of the Director of Public Works review, an additional bill becomes due the customer must send payment (payable to the City of Norco) for the entire amount of the additional bill. Failure to do so will constitute acceptance by the customer of the bill(s) as rendered, and authorize discontinuance of service in accordance with Section 14.04.110.

2.    Failure of the customer to file a written appeal with the Director of Public Works and provide a good faith payment to Utility Billing within the required seven-day period will constitute acceptance by the customer of the initial bill determination rendered, and Utility Billing may authorize discontinuance of service in accordance with Section 14.04.110.

3.    If the customer is not satisfied with the written determination of the Director of Public Works the customer may submit a written appeal to the City Council. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the City Council, City of Norco, 2870 Clark Ave, Norco, California 92860, together with reasons for the dispute within 10 days following receipt of the Director of Public Works’ determination. In the absence of a timely filed appeal, the decision of the Director of Public Works shall be final. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the City Clerk shall then place the matter on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the City Council for consideration. A written decision of the City Council determination shall be delivered to the customer by personal delivery or certified mail within 10 days following the appeal hearing. Once a determination has been provided by the City Council the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from the City Council’s determination if the due date has already expired. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.110 Discontinuance and restoration of service.
A.    Past Due Utility Bills. Utility bills rendered shall be considered past due if not paid before the due date shown on the bill.

B.    Nonpayment of Utility Bills.

1.    When a utility bill has become past due and a discontinuance of service notification for nonpayment has been issued, service may be discontinued if the bill is not paid within the time required by such notice.

2.    Discontinuance of service or “shut-off notice” may be delivered by standard mail, hand delivered, or automated phone messaging system.

3.    A customer’s water service may be discontinued for nonpayment of a bill for service previously rendered at any location served by the Water Utility provided such bill is not paid within 15 days after notice that present service will be discontinued for nonpayment of such bill for prior service. The customer will continue to be charged the monthly “water service charge” during the period the meter has been disconnected due to nonpayment.

4.    If a customer is receiving more than one water service, any or all water services may be discontinued when any water service, regardless of location, is discontinued for nonpayment. However, single-family residential service will not be discontinued because of nonpayment of bills for other classes of service, except when other classes of service serve the same premises.

C.    Unsafe Equipment and Cross-Connections. The Water Utility may refuse or discontinue service to a customer if any part of the customer’s plumbing, backflow prevention devices, or other equipment, or the use thereof, shall be determined by the Water Utility to be unsafe in violation of applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations of public authorities, or if any condition existing upon the customer’s premises shall be thus determined to endanger the Water Utility’s service facilities, until it shall have been put in a safe condition or the violation remedied. See Section 14.04.210 for additional regulations regarding the Water Utility’s cross-connection program.

The Water Utility does not assume any responsibility of inspecting or repairing the customer’s plumbing or other equipment or any part thereof and assumes no liability therefor.

1.    Cross-connection items that create a basis for water service discontinuation shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.    Refusal to install or test a backflow prevention device.

b.    Refusal to repair or replace a faulty backflow prevention device.

c.    Direct or indirect connection between the public water system and a sewer line.

d.    Unprotected direct or indirect connection between the public water system and a system or equipment containing contaminants.

e.    Unprotected direct or indirect connection between the public water system and an auxiliary water system.

f.    A situation which presents an immediate health hazard to the public water system.

The Water Utility will terminate service to a customer’s premises after a written notice has been sent specifying the corrective action needed and the time period in which it must be done. If no action is taken within the allowed time period, water service may be terminated. The water service will remain inactive until correction of violations has been approved by the Water Utility.

D.    Service Detrimental to Other Customers. The Water Utility will not provide service to any equipment, the operation of which will be detrimental to the service of the Water Utility or its other customers and will discontinue water service to any customer who shall continue to operate such equipment after having been given notice by the Water Utility to cease so doing.

E.    Fraud. The Water Utility may refuse or discontinue service if the acts of the customer or the conditions upon the premises are such as to indicate intent to defraud the Water Utility.

F.    Jumper. The deliberate bypass or connection around the water meter between the service and the main shall be prohibited. All water use, except as provided in the case of private fire protection, shall pass through the meter. Any customer identified to have deliberately jumped or bypassed the water meter to obtain water service shall be charged a “jumper fee” as stated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

G.    Failure to Establish or Reestablish Credit. If, for an applicant’s convenience, Utility Billing should provide service before credit is established or should continue service to a customer when credit has not been reestablished in accordance with Section 14.04.060, and fails to establish or reestablish credit, the Water Utility may discontinue service.

H.    Noncompliance. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the Water Utility may discontinue service to a customer for noncompliance with the rate schedules and the rules and regulations, if, after written notice of at least five days, the customer has not complied with the notice. The Water Utility may dispense with the giving of such notice in the event there exists, in the Water Utility’s opinion, a dangerous condition, thus rendering the immediate discontinuance of service to the premises imperative.

I.    Customer’s Request for Service Discontinuance. When a customer desires to terminate responsibility for service, Utility Billing shall be given not less than two days’ notice of intention. The customer shall state the date on which termination becomes effective. A customer may be held responsible for all services furnished at the premises until two days after receipt of such notice by Utility Billing or until the date of termination specified in the notice, whichever date is later.

J.    Restoration—Reconnection Charge.

1.    Utility Billing shall require a payment of a “service turn-off charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council plus other associated fees or charges for each service that has been discontinued for nonpayment of bills or for failure otherwise to comply with rules prescribed by the Water Utility. Such charges shall be paid before service is reconnected; this charge is designated as the “service turn-off charge” in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

2.    If the customer turns on a service or allows or causes it to be turned on after it has been turned off for the above reasons, the Water Utility may lock off the meter or may remove the meter and not unlock or reinstall the meter until amounts due from the customer are collected or rules are complied with, and Utility Billing will charge the actual cost for restoration of a meter under these conditions. In addition, the customer shall be charged the cost for any and all damages to the meter or appurtenances.

3.    If the customer turns on a service or allows or causes it to be turned on after it has been turned off for nonpayment of a utility bill, by means of cutting or otherwise removing a City lock, they will be charged a “damaged lock charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

4.    If a customer has illegally removed a lock the Water Utility may elect to remove the meter and install a plug to prevent the customer from illegally using water while the utility bill remains past due. In such cases the customer will be charged a “pulled meter fee” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

5.    If the customer requests that service be permanently stopped there will be no charge for the final reading of the meter and turn-off of the meter. If the customer contacts Utility Billing after the final reading and the water has been turned off, the charge to reconnect the services will be charged the same as a “service turn-on charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

6.    If a customer requests that a service be turned back on after normal business hours (assuming appropriate payment has been made and verified) the customer will be assessed an “after-hours service turn-on charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council. This accommodation will be provided at the discretion of Director of Finance or his/her designee and will be based on the availability of field staff at the time of request.

7.    As a condition to reestablish service, the Finance Officer or his/her designee may elect to require the customer to provide an additional deposit toward the account. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.120 Information available to the public.
A.    General Information. The Water Utility will maintain, open for public inspection at its offices, pertinent information regarding the service rendered, including the following:

1.    Characteristics of Water. Copies of the most recent annual water quality report of the water supplied to customers.

2.    Rates and Rules. A copy of the rate schedules consisting of the rates, fees, charges, deposits, and general rules of the Water Utility.

B.    New or Revised Rates. Should new or revised rates be established after the time application is made, the Water Utility will, within a reasonable time, use such means as may be practicable to bring them to the attention of those of its customers who may be affected thereby. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.130 Temporary service.
A.    Conditions of Service. The Water Utility shall, if no undue hardships to its existing customers will result therefrom, furnish temporary service for construction work, circuses, Christmas tree lots, bazaars, fairs, plumbing pressure testing, or other similar uses that because of their nature will not be used steadily or permanently. All such services shall be subject to the following conditions:

1.    Application for a temporary service permit with the appropriate deposit shall be made to Utility Billing. The deposit for temporary service shall be refunded after charges for water service charge, water consumption and the loss or damage of a meter and/or fittings have been deducted at the termination of service.

2.    Temporary service connections may be terminated at any time and will be made at the discretion of the Water Utility.

3.    Charges for loss or damage to a meter and fittings will be based upon current prices.

4.    Temporary services shall generally be taken from existing outlets on the water system or from fire hydrants designated by the Water Utility. Any special outlets shall be installed at the customer’s expense.

5.    Backflow prevention devices and approved plumbing materials may be required for certain types of uses and shall be installed at the customer’s expense.

6.    The temporary service permit must be kept at the job site at all times.

7.    The temporary meter shall be available to be inspected by the Water Utility upon request.

B.    Metered Services. The Water Utility has developed a program to install a “temporary construction meter” on a publicly owned fire hydrant to supply water for approved construction projects. “Temporary construction meter” is not designed to provide potable water service in place of installing a permanent water service or for dust control on residential or commercial properties and will be subject to the following conditions:

1.    Deposits for “temporary construction meter” service shall be as follows per the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

2.    Permit charge for “temporary construction meter” service shall be per the “temporary service permit: metered,” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council. This fee includes the installation and removal of the meter by the Water Utility. Meter is locked on the fire hydrant to prevent theft and ensure meter is at authorized location for future inspection and meter readings.

3.    “Temporary construction meter” may be moved from one location to another, with the approval of the Water Utility. “Temporary service relocation charge” as designated in the fee resolution adopted by City Council is charged for all relocations.

4.    A “monthly service charge” will be charged based on the three-inch service connection provided by the City per the rate schedule adopted by City Council. If the temporary water service is used for a period less than 30 days then the monthly service charge will be prorated based on the actual number of days the service was in use.

C.    Unmetered Services. If, in the opinion of the Water Utility, the setting of a temporary meter is impractical or uneconomical, a temporary unmetered service connection can be made. Unmetered connections will be subject to the following conditions:

1.    Charge for unmetered services, other than spacers, shall be as follows:

a.    Permit charge designated as “temporary service permit: unmetered” in the fee resolution adopted by City Council.

b.    Commodity charge based on current rate and estimated quantity to be used.

D.    Rates. Rates for temporary service shall be approved and adopted by resolution by City Council. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.140 Continuity of service.
A.    Shortage and Interruption.

1.    The Water Utility will exercise reasonable diligence to furnish a continuous and sufficient supply of water to its customers and to avoid any shortage or interruption of delivery thereof. It cannot, however, guarantee a continuous or sufficient supply or freedom from interruption.

2.    The Water Utility will not be liable for interruption or shortage of supply, nor for any loss or damage occasioned thereby.

3.    Whenever, in the operation of the Water Utility’s system, interruption in the delivery of water to customers results from or is occasioned by causes other than the exercise by the Water Utility of its right to suspend temporarily the delivery of water for the purpose of making repairs or improvement to its system, notice of any such interruption will not be given to the customers of the Water Utility, but the Water Utility shall exercise reasonable diligence to reinstitute delivery of water.

B.    Temporary Suspension for Repairs. The Water Utility, whenever it shall find it necessary for the purpose of making repairs or improvements to its system, will have the right to suspend temporarily the delivery of water. In all such cases, as reasonable notice thereof as circumstances will permit will be given to the customer, and the making of such repairs or improvements will be completed as rapidly as may be practicable and, if practicable, at such times as will cause the least inconvenience to its customers.

C.    Apportionment of Supply During Time of Shortage. Should a shortage of supply ever occur, the Water Utility will apportion its available supply of water among its customers as authorized or directed by the Director of Public Works in the manner that appears most equitable under conditions then prevailing.

D.    Use of Water During Emergency. In the case of an emergency necessitating the use of water from the City mains, the Fire Chief designee may limit the use of water on adjoining properties which in the opinion of the designee would prevent or hamper the water flows for the emergency. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.150 New development and main extensions.
A.    General Provisions.

1.    Applicability.

a.    New development shall be imposed a “water infrastructure facilities fee” (see Chapter 3.40) that is intended to provide funds for the construction of facilities to ensure a continuing supply of potable water including pump stations, water reservoir facilities, wells, treatment facilities and waterlines.

b.    All extensions of distribution and transmission mains from the Water Utility’s existing water system to serve new customers shall be made under the provisions of this rule.

2.    Slow Meters. When upon testing a meter used for residential service is found to be registering more than 25 percent slow or any meter for other classes of service is found to be registering more than 10 percent slow, the Utility Billing may bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge based on corrected meter readings for the period the meter was in service, but not to exceed a period of four months.

3.    Nonregistering Meters. Utility Billing may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was nonregistering, but not to exceed a period of four months, using an estimate of the consumption based upon the customer’s prior use over a 12-month period. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.04.190 Service to separate premises and multiple units, and resale of water.
A.    Number of Services to Separate Premises. Separate premises (lot or parcel of real property) under single control or management will be supplied through separate individual service connections unless the Water Utility elects otherwise.

B.    Service to Multiple Units on Same Premises. Separate houses, buildings, living, or business quarters on the same premises, under a single control or management, may be served at the option of the applicant by either of the following methods:

1.    Through separate service connections to each or any unit providing that the piping system from each service is independent of the others, and is not interconnected. This will allow for independent billing for services to each dwelling unit or business.

2.    Through a single service connection to supply the entire premises. In such case, the Water Utility will require a single service connection with individual customer meters to serve each dwelling unit or business. This will allow for independent billing for services to each dwelling unit or business.

The responsibility for payment of charges for all services furnished, in accordance with these rules, must be assumed by the applicant and/or owner. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

In the event of obstruction or obscuring, notice shall be given by the Water Utility to the property adjacent to such hydrant that the obstruction be removed within a designated time. If obstructions are not removed within the designated time, the Water Utility will remove at the property owner’s expense.

D.    Use of Fire Hydrants. Public or private fire hydrants connected to the City water system shall be operated only by the Water Utility, Norco Fire Department, or a person who has obtained a permit from the Water Utility. Any person desiring to use water through any public or private hydrant must comply with Section 14.04.130 and this section. Any person using a fire hydrant without a permit may be charged with theft of water and fined. Tampering with any fire hydrant for the unauthorized use of water therefrom, or for any other purpose, is an infraction punishable by law.

E.    Hydrant Flow Tests. Fire flow tests are conducted on hydrants to determine water availability in planning for firefighting activities, fire sprinkler systems or domestic water demand. The tests are also useful in determining the general condition of the water distribution system by detecting closed valves or wall deposits. A well-maintained water system enables firefighters to extinguish flames and prevent large-scale damage or loss of life.

The Water Utility offers fire flow availability testing services by contacting the Public Works Counter at (951) 270-5627, identify the hydrant location you would like to be tested and pay the required nonrefundable fee as specified as “fire flow test fee” in the fee resolution adopted by City Council. At its discretion, the Water Utility may also allow the customer to hire a third party contractor to perform the fire flow test. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

2.    Policy.

a.    No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the Water Utility unless the water supply is protected as required by Title 17 of California Code of Regulations—Sections 7583 through 7605, California Plumbing Codes and these regulations. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the Water Utility if a backflow prevention assembly required by these regulations is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions of defects are corrected.

b.    All developers, contractors or others performing installation of any backflow assembly must adhere to current City of Norco Water Utility specifications and standards. A copy of Water Utility specifications and standards can be viewed online at the City of Norco website or a hard copy can be purchased at City Hall—Public Works counter.

c.    The consumer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the City of Norco and County of Riverside Public Health to determine whether unprotected cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of the regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the Director shall immediately discontinue service to the premises by locking off the service at the meter or providing for a physical break in the service line until the consumer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with California Laws and Regulations, California Plumbing Codes statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

d.    An approved backflow prevention assembly shall also be installed on each service line to a consumer’s water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:

1.    In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be a safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the Director of Public Works, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard.

2.    In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line commensurate with the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the Water Utility’s system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.

3.    In the case of premises having (a) internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected or protected against, or (b) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line.

e.    The type of protective assembly required under subsections (C)(2)(d)(1) through (3) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:

1.    In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection (C)(2)(d)(1) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly.

2.    In the case of any premises where there is water or substances that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly.

3.    In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries and plating plants.

4.    In the case of any premises where there are unprotected cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection.

5.    In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises.

f.    Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a make, model and size approved by the Water Utility. The term “approved backflow prevention assembly” shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association entitled:

AWWA/ANSI—Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assemblies;

AWWA/ANSI—Standard for Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assemblies;

and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California (USC FCCCHR) established in:

Specifications of Backflow Prevention Assemblies—Section 10 of the most current edition of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control.

Backflow preventers which may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by USC FCCCHR and are listed on USC’s current list of approved backflow prevention assemblies may be used without further test or qualification.

g.    It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have a field test performed by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation and at least once per year. In those instances where the Water Utility deems the hazard to be great enough the City may require field tests at more frequent intervals. These tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester approved by the County of Riverside Public Health. It shall be the duty of the Water Utility to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs and overhauls must be provided to the Water Utility and the County of Riverside Public Health for their respective permanent files.

h.    All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except for the testing and maintenance requirements under subsection (C)(2)(g) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the Water Utility is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the Water Utility’s system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the Water Utility finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

i.    The Director is authorized to make all necessary and reasonable rules and policies with respect to the enforcement of said cross-connection program.

3.    Surveys and Notification.

Plans must be submitted to the Water Utility upon request for review of potential unprotected cross-connection hazards as a condition of service from a new service connection. If it is decided that a backflow prevention assembly is necessary to protect the Water Utility’s potable water system, the required assembly must be installed and tested before service will be established. The location of the new backflow assembly shall be above grade as close as practical to the water service connection. The Director of Public Works or his/her designee must approve the location of all backflow prevention assemblies installed for service protection (meter protection, irrigation or fire service). Any new backflow prevention assemblies required for internal protection shall be inspected for proper installation/orientation by the Director of Public Works or his/her designee.

b.    Existing Service Connection. The Water Utility may require an on-premises inspection or re-inspection survey to evaluate the cross-connection hazards of any premises to which it serves water. The Water Utility will request an inspection appointment with each affected customer. Any customer who cannot or will not allow an on-premises inspection of the water piping system shall be required to install the approved backflow prevention assembly the Water Utility considers necessary.

1.    The Water Utility will notify the customer of the survey inspection findings, listing any required corrective actions. A period of 30 days will be given to complete all corrective actions requested, including installation and testing of all necessary backflow protection assemblies. A 30-day extension may be granted in situations having extenuating circumstances.

2.    A second notice will be sent to each customer who does not take the required corrective action prescribed in the first notice. The second notice will give the customer an additional two-week period to complete the required action. If no action is taken within the two-week period, the Director of Public Works may suspend water service to the affected customer until the required corrective actions are completed.

4.    Annual Backflow Assembly Test/Inspection.

a.    An annual testing notice will be sent to notify the water customer when an assembly needs to be tested. It shall contain a date when the testing must be completed.

1.    First Notice. This notice will give the water customer one month to have the assembly tested. The original test report must be returned to the City of Norco’s Department of Public Works and a copy submitted to the County of Riverside Public Health. Whenever a test shows a malfunction, the assembly shall be repaired or replaced within 15 days of observed failure and shall be retested.

2.    Second Notice. This notice shall be sent to each customer not having their backflow prevention assembly tested within the time limit prescribed in the first notice. The second notice will give the customer an additional two-week period to complete the required testing.

3.    Third and Final Notice. This notice shall be sent to each customer not having their backflow prevention assembly tested within the time limit prescribed in the second notice. This notice will be hand delivered or sent certified mail to the customer. The customer will have an additional seven days to complete the required testing. Any customer failing to complete the required testing within the allotted time may have their water service(s) suspended. The Director of Public Works will make the final determination regarding whether to suspend water service to the affected customer until the required backflow testing has been completed.

b.    Testing of backflow assemblies shall only be conducted by competent backflow prevention assembly testers certified by the County of Riverside Public Health. A copy of the current list of certified testers can be reviewed on the City’s website or by contacting the County of Riverside Public Health directly. Testing and maintenance costs are the responsibility of the water customer. All backflow prevention assemblies must be tested immediately after installation, relocation or repair and at least annually after that.

5.    Backflow Enclosure.

a.    All backflow prevention assemblies utilized for system protection, between three-quarter inch and two and one-half inches in size, must be provided minimal protection from vandalism/theft by installing a backflow enclosure. All new backflow prevention assemblies between three-quarter inch and two and one-half inches in size must have a backflow enclosure unless a written waiver has been granted by the Director of Public Works or his/her designee. Installation requirements and specifications for the backflow protective enclosure can be found in the City of Norco’s Water Utility specifications and standards handbook. The backflow protective enclosure must be painted to meet the Water Utility standards. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

H.    Water Shortage Response Level 5—Water Shortage Emergency Condition.

1.    A water shortage response level 5 condition is also referred to as a “water shortage emergency” condition. A level 5 condition applies when the City Council declares a water shortage emergency pursuant to California Water Code Section 350 et seq. or due to other increasing reductions in the City’s water supplies resulting in a shortage of more than 40 percent. Customers are required to reduce their water consumption more than 40 percent to ensure that sufficient supplies will be available to meet anticipated demands. The City Council shall declare a water shortage emergency in the manner and on the grounds provided in California Water Code Section 350 et seq. The City Council shall declare the existence of a water shortage response level 5 by the adoption of a resolution, and the City Manager or designee shall implement the level 5 conservation practices.

a.    Residential and Multifamily Customers.

1.    The City Council will determine the water allocation target percentage for residential accounts in the resolution adopting a level 5 “water shortage response.”

2.    This calculation will not apply to any residential accounts that use less than 10 units in the billing period to ensure water is provided for public health and safety.

3.    A residential water allocation target will be calculated for each account by comparing the current billing period usage to the same period in the previous year.

4.    If the residential account uses more water than the water allocation target amount, said residential accounts shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein.

b.    Commercial Customers.

1.    The City Council will determine the water allocation target percentage for commercial accounts in the resolution adopting a level 5 “water shortage response.”

2.    A commercial water allocation target will be calculated for each account by comparing the current billing period usage to the same period in the previous year.

3.    If the commercial account uses more water than the water allocation target amount, said commercial account shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein.

4.    Dedicated irrigation accounts must reduce their usage by 50 percent. The amount may be adjusted by a resolution of the City Council as deemed necessary to meet water supply demands.

5.    An application may be made to the City Council for a variance from the water allocation target.

I.    Procedures for Determination and Notification of Water Shortage Response Level.

1.    City Manager shall monitor water shortage conditions and regulations, as well as evaluate the supply and demand for water by its customers, and shall recommend the water shortage response level to be declared by the members of the City Council by resolution.

2.    Upon declaration by the City Council of the existence of a water shortage response level 1 “watch” condition the City shall post notice of the condition on its website.

3.    Upon declaration by the City Council of the existence of water shortage response level 2 “water shortage caution,” level 3 “water shortage alert,” level 4 “water shortage critical,” or level 5 “water shortage emergency,” the mandatory conservation measures applicable to water shortage response level 2, 3, 4, or 5 conditions shall take effect on the tenth day after the date the response level is declared or as required by State law. If the City establishes a water allocation in response to a water shortage response level 2, 3, 4, or 5 condition, it shall provide notice of the allocation by including it in the regular billing statement for the fee or charge or by any other mailing to the address to which the City customarily mails the billing statement for fees or charges for ongoing water service. The City shall also post notice on the City’s website. Water allocation shall be effective on the fifth day following the date of mailing or at such later date as specified in the notice.

4.    The City Council may declare an end to a water shortage response level by the adoption of a resolution at any regular or special meeting.

J.    Violations and Penalties.

1.    Any person, who uses, causes to be used, or permits the use of water in violation of any portion of this section is guilty of an offense punishable as provided herein.

2.    The City will make a reasonable effort to assist customers with compliance. Reasonable efforts include, but are not limited to, personal contact, door hanger, letter, email and via telephone whenever possible to notify customers of any violation.

3.    Each day that a violation of this section occurs is a separate offense.

4.    Civil penalties shall be imposed for each violation including both water use restrictions specifically cited in this program in water shortage levels 2 through 5 and water allocation target violations as listed in water shortage levels 4 and 5 as follows:

a.    Twenty-five dollars for a first violation. Water usage between one and 20 units in excess of the water allocation target during a single billing cycle shall also constitute a first violation.

b.    Fifty dollars for a second violation of any provision of this section within one year of the date of the first violation. Water usage between 21 and 50 units in excess of the water allocation target during a single billing cycle shall also constitute a second violation.

c.    One hundred dollars for a third violation of this section within one year of the date of the first violation. Water usage between 51 and 100 units in excess of the water allocation target during a single billing cycle shall also constitute a third violation.

d.    Two hundred dollars for a fourth violation of this section within one year of the first violation. Water usage between 101 and 300 units in excess of the water allocation target during a single billing cycle shall also constitute a fourth violation.

e.    Five hundred dollars for a fifth violation of this section within one year of the first violation. Water usage over 300 units in excess of the water allocation target during a single billing cycle shall also constitute an additional violation, in excess of four.

f.    When a civil penalty is to be imposed, the customer will be given written notice of the penalty to be imposed. Within seven days after delivery of such notice, the customer may submit a written request to the City requesting a hearing by the City Manager or designee and an opportunity to present evidence that a violation has not occurred. Within seven business days after the hearing, the City Manager or designee shall render a decision in writing to the customer that requested the hearing. Upon receipt of the written decision, the customer shall have seven days to appeal the decision to the City Council. The City Council shall then schedule the matter for consideration at a regular or special meeting of the City Council and render its decision, which shall be a final decision.

5.    Violation is further subject to enforcement through the installation of a flow-restricting device at the meter.

6.    In addition to the above civil penalties, each violation of this code is subject to Chapter 1.04.

7.    Willful violations of the mandatory conservation measures and water-use restrictions applicable during a level 5 water shortage emergency condition may be enforced by discontinuing service to the property at which the violation occurs.

K.    Drought Surcharges. During declared water shortage response levels 2 through 5, mandatory water reductions may result in unplanned reduction in revenues in the water fund. To address the potential future reductions in revenues the City Council may elect to enact a “drought surcharge” during each respective level as a means to stabilize rate revenues. It is important to note that the “drought surcharge” would only be enacted as deemed necessary by the City Council. While the City may never need to enact the surcharges, having the ability to implement them if necessary would allow the City to quickly address unforeseen revenue shortages due to mandatory conservation in the future. The “drought surcharge” shall not be more than adopted by City Council as establish by resolution and within proper public notification guidelines as required by Federal or State rules and regulations. A copy of all current “drought surcharges” shall be provided upon request and listed on the City’s website. (Ord. 1017 Sec. 1, 2017)

14.07.010 Adoption.
The following rules and regulations for wastewater discharge and sanitary sewer collection and treatment services by the City of Norco are hereby adopted. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

14.07.020 Sewer utility policy.
Under the provisions of the California Constitution and this chapter, the City owns and operates a public utility service for sanitary sewer collection and treatment for the citizens and businesses of Norco.

This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for all persons and private or public entities that discharge wastewater into the sewage system of the City of Norco, and also sets forth procedures for complying with requirements imposed upon the City of Norco by other regulatory agencies. All discharges of wastewater into the City of Norco’s collection system are subject to the requirements set forth in this chapter. This chapter enables the City of Norco to comply with all applicable State and Federal regulations established by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations set forth in 40 CFR 403.

The objectives of the Sewer Utility are to protect and preserve the health and safety of the citizens and personnel of the City and comply with Federal, State and local laws and regulations and permits in the discharge of wastewater. This chapter provides for regulation through issuance of permits to all dischargers of regulated wastewater, including certain industrial users, and enforcement of general requirements for other users. This chapter also authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities and user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs for sewer service.

It is recognized that the City Council is the governing body of the City and as such is ultimately responsible to the citizens of Norco for the Sewer Utility. With the City Manager’s direction and guidance, the City’s Public Works Department management and supervisory personnel shall continually anticipate the sewer service and related needs of all the customers in the community and shall be responsive to their needs and requirements. Public Works staff shall strive to maintain the highest level of service possible within the capability of the personnel that manage and maintain the Sewer Utility.

It is understood the wastewater treatment plant may be limited in its capacity to treat effectively the wastewaters of the City. The City, acting by and through its City Council, shall have the authority to declare from time to time moratoria on the granting of connection permits under this chapter if and when the Council determines in its discretion that the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant at any such time is insufficient to treat adequately or effectively the then-current and/or the then-projected future discharges of wastewater to the wastewater facilities. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

14.07.030 Service area.
The area in which sewer service is or will be furnished by the Sewer Utility is that area which is within the City boundaries as the boundaries now prevail or may from time to time exist. The Sewer Utility may provide sewer service to a customer outside its service area if there is no other agency with infrastructure to provide said sewer service or with permission of the applicable sewer provider. The rate for providing said sewer service out of the service area will be based on the currently adopted rate by the City. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

A.    Application for Service. Each applicant for sewer service may be required to sign an application on a form provided by Utility Billing, and upon request will be required to furnish to following information:

1.    Name of applicant;

2.    Date and place of application;

10.    Such other information as Utility Billing may reasonably require.

The application is a request for service and does not in itself bind the Sewer Utility to serve, except under its adopted rate schedules, nor does it bind the customer to take service for a longer period than the minimum requirements of the rate schedule.

All new accounts will be assessed a one-time new account setup fee as specified in the adopted fee resolution. No new account setup fee shall be charged if the applicant already has a water service account.

B.    Individual Liability for Joint Service. Two or more persons who join in one application or contract for service shall be jointly and severally liable thereunder and shall be billed by means of a single periodic bill mailed to the person designated on the application to receive the bill.

C.    Owner/Renter Liability. In the event any fees and other charges due from any occupant for any customer class, as provided for in this section, should become due and payable and fall delinquent, the owner or owners of the premises, whether or not other than the occupant, shall forthwith be jointly and severally liable for the payment of all such fees and charges which have fallen delinquent. For this reason, the owner of the property must provide written authorization to the renter to sign up for service using the appropriate form provided by Utility Billing.

D.    Change in Customer’s Equipment or Operations. Customers shall give the Sewer Utility written notice of the extent and nature of any material change in operations for which the Sewer Utility collection of wastewater may change prior to making any such change.

E.    Deposit. Any applicant with a preexisting water account in good standing shall not be required to provide a deposit when adding sewer services to the same property.

The Sewer Utility’s deposit policy is designed to assess the credit risk associated with all customer applications for new or continued service, while protecting the assets of the Sewer Utility. No Sewer Utility service shall be provided to any applicant for the commencement of such services or for the restoration of such services until said applicant has paid to Utility Billing a deposit in the amount specified in the adopted fee resolution. Said deposit shall be made in the form of cash, money order, credit, or debit unless waived by the Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative.

Said deposit shall be retained by Utility Billing until the sewer services have been terminated by the customer or by Utility Billing for nonpayment of billings for services within the time established by appropriate City of Norco ordinances and resolutions. Upon the termination of said services, Utility Billing shall credit the deposit toward any outstanding billing due and owing, by the applicant, for any or all services. After Utility Billing has made such credit, if there be such, that portion of the deposit not so credited shall be refunded to the applicant. The Finance Officer or his/her duly appointed representative may waive all or a portion of the deposit at his/her discretion.

Residential customers may request a refund of any deposit held on their account after a period of 18 months. Said refund will only be granted if the customer had a payment history that was on-time and without any fees for 18 consecutive billing periods. The deposits for all other customer classifications are not eligible for a refund until the account is closed.

B.    Notice from Customers. Notices from a customer to the Utility Billing may be given by written communication mailed to Utility Billing or City Clerk’s office. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

14.07.120 Rendering and payment of bills.
A.    Rendering of Bills. Bills for sewer service will be rendered monthly via the utility bill, or as otherwise provided in the rate schedules. The Finance Officer may change the billing period of a customer if such change is considered in the best interests of the Sewer Utility.

14.07.130 Disputed bills.
A.    Billed Sewer Discharges. A customer who believes that the sewer portion of the utility bill is in error must first contact Utility Billing by phone or in writing before the due date on the bill stating the nature of their dispute. Utility Billing shall contact the customer within 10 days from the date the dispute is received with a determination. Once a determination has been provided by Utility Billing the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from Utility Billing’s determination if the due date has already expired.

B.    Disputed Sewer Bill Appeal.

1.    If the customer is not satisfied with the determination by Utility Billing, the customer may formally appeal the disputed bill in question to the Director of Public Works for review by submitting a written statement setting forth the reasons why the customer believes the bill is incorrect. The customer must submit the appeal within seven days of the initial dispute determination to the Director of Public Works, City of Norco, 2870 Clark Avenue, Norco, California 92860. However, in order to have the disputed bill considered by the Director of Public Works, the customer must submit a payment equal to the customer’s most recent paid utility bill to Utility Billing (payable to the City of Norco). Upon timely receipt of the written statement and payment, the Director of Public Works or his/her designee will review the basis of the billed amount, and communicate the results of the review and determination to the customer. Once a determination has been provided by the Director of Public Works the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from the Director of Public Works’ determination if the due date has already expired.

A customer who formally disputes the accuracy of the sewer portion of a utility bill will not have the sewer service discontinued for nonpayment and will not be responsible for any late fees that may occur during the review period. If before completion of the Director of Public Works review, an additional bill becomes due the customer must send payment (payable to the City of Norco) for the entire amount of the additional bill. Failure to do so will constitute acceptance by the customer of the bill(s) as rendered, and authorize discontinuance of service in accordance with Section 14.07.140.

2.    Failure of the customer to file a written appeal with the Director of Public Works and provide a good faith payment to Utility Billing within the required seven-day period will constitute acceptance by the customer of the initial bill determination rendered, and Utility Billing may authorize discontinuance of service in accordance with Section 14.07.140.

3.    If the customer is not satisfied with the written determination of the Director of Public Works the customer may submit a written appeal to the City Council. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the City Council, City of Norco, 2870 Clark Avenue, Norco, California 92860, together with reasons for the dispute within 10 days following receipt of the Director of Public Works’ determination. In the absence of a timely filed appeal, the decision of the Director of Public Works shall be final. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the City Clerk shall then place the matter on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the City Council for consideration. A written decision of the City Council determination shall be delivered to the customer by personal delivery or certified mail within 10 days following the appeal hearing. Once a determination has been provided by the City Council the customer shall submit payment for the total or adjusted utility bill before the existing due date listed on the bill or within seven days from the City Council’s determination if the due date has already expired. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

14.07.140 Discontinuance and restoration of service.
A.    Past Due Utility Bills. Utility bills rendered shall be considered past due if not paid before the due date shown on the bill.

B.    Nonpayment of Utility Bills.

1.    When a utility bill has become past due and a discontinuance of service notification for nonpayment has been issued, service may be discontinued if the bill is not paid within the time required by such notice.

2.    Discontinuance of service or a shut-off notice may be delivered by standard mail, hand delivered, or by automated phone messaging system.

3.    In order to effect a shutoff or discontinuance of sewer services, the Sewer Utility may shut off a customer’s water service for nonpayment of a bill for service previously rendered customer at any location served by the Sewer Utility provided such bill is not paid within 15 days after presentation of a notice that present service will be discontinued for nonpayment of such bill for prior service. The customer will continue to be charged the monthly sewer service charge during the period the meter has been disconnected due to nonpayment.

4.    If a property is receiving more than one sewer service, any or all water services may be discontinued when any sewer service, regardless of location, is discontinued for nonpayment. However, single-family residential service will not be discontinued because of nonpayment of bills for other classes of service, except when other classes of service serve the same premises.

5.    Under no circumstances may service be discontinued for nonpayment of a bill to correct previously billed incorrect charges for a period in excess of the preceding four months, unless such incorrect charges have resulted from the customer not abiding by the rate schedules.

C.    Fraud. The Sewer Utility may refuse or discontinue service if the acts of the customer or the conditions upon the premises are such as to indicate intent to defraud the Sewer Utility.

D.    Failure to Establish or Reestablish Credit. If, for an applicant’s convenience, Utility Billing should provide service before credit is established or should continue service to a customer when credit has not been reestablished in accordance with Section 14.07.090, and fails to establish or reestablish credit, the Sewer Utility may discontinue service.

E.    Noncompliance. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the Sewer Utility may discontinue service to a customer for noncompliance with the rate schedules and the rules and regulations, if, after written notice of at least five days, the customer has not complied with the notice. The Sewer Utility may dispense with the giving of such notice in the event there exists, in the Sewer Utility’s opinion, a dangerous condition, thus rendering the immediate discontinuance of service to the premises imperative.

F.    Customer’s Request for Service Discontinuance. When a customer desires to terminate responsibility for service, Utility Billing shall be given not less than two days’ notice of intention. The customer shall state the date on which termination becomes effective. A customer may be held responsible for all services furnished at the premises until two days after receipt of such notice by Utility Billing or until the date of termination specified in the notice, whichever date is later.

G.    Restoration—Reconnection Charge. As a condition to reestablish service, the Finance Officer or his/her designee may elect to require the customer to provide an additional deposit toward the account. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

14.07.150 Information available to the public.
A.    General Information. The names and addresses of customers of the City, or correspondence of the City, shall not be publicly available, except to the extent required by law, and no mailing lists shall be provided by the City or by any of its officers or employees, which mailing lists are compiled from records of the City.

1.    Applicability.

a.    Wastewater Infrastructure Facilities Fee. New development shall be imposed a wastewater infrastructure facilities fee (see Chapter 3.40) that is intended to provide funds for the construction of facilities to insure a continuing collection and treatment of wastewater including pipelines, manholes, lift stations, siphons, force mains and treatment facilities. However, any property that previously paid a sewer assessment as part of an established sewer assessment district shall not be subject to wastewater infrastructure facilities fee.

b.    All extensions of collection and transmission mains from the Sewer Utility’s existing sewer system to serve new customers shall be made under the provisions of this rule.

The total cost of any such extension shall be reimbursed to the Sewer Utility by the owner or developer of properties benefited by said extension by payment of sewer infrastructure facilities fee at the time application for water service is made.

d.    The Sewer Utility may approve extensions under this rule in easements or rights-of-way where final grades have not been established or where street grades have not been established. If extensions are made when grades have not been established and there is a reasonable probability that the existing grade will change, the Sewer Utility shall require that the applicant or applicants for the main extension deposit the estimated net cost of relocating, raising, or lowering facilities upon establishment of final grade.

e.    The design of an extension shall be based upon:

i.    The provision of adequate capacity to meet the present and future requirements of the area to be benefited to be benefited.

B.    Extensions to Serve Individuals, Subdivisions, Tracts, and Commercial and Industrial Developments.

1.    Collection System Mains. Where a collection system main must be extended to a new subdivision or development, the entire cost of the main shall be paid for and be installed by the developer of the property to which the system is extended.

The Director of Public Works may determine that the best interests of the collection system would be served by a collection main larger than that required by the applicant’s needs and require the applicant to install a larger size main. Applicants shall be responsible for the entire cost of all collection system mains up through 12 inches in diameter.

2.    Transmission Collection System Mains. A transmission collection main extension which is larger than 12 inches in diameter shall be designated as a transmission collection main. Transmission collection mains shall be paid for jointly by the Sewer Utility and the developer extending the main. The Sewer Utility shall pay only those costs attributable to the larger size main on an incremental basis, not on a proportional basis. The cost to be paid by the Sewer Utility for said incremental difference shall be the subject of an agreement between the Sewer Utility and the developer and shall be based on current estimates or actual bid prices.

3.    The Developer’s Responsibility.

a.    Complete engineering of the main extension shall be by a registered civil engineer and shall include submission of a full set of detailed improvement plans of a scale acceptable to the Sewer Utility, along with applicable plan check and inspection fees.

b.    After all changes, modifications, and additions requested by the Sewer Utility have been made on the plans and they have been approved, the owner or developer shall file a complete set of reproducible permanent transparencies of the approved plans with the Sewer Utility. Said transparencies shall become the property of the City.

c.    The developer shall have the required installation performed by a contractor who possesses a current City of Norco business license, California Class A contractor’s license permitting this type of construction work and shall furnish the necessary surety as required under the Norco Municipal Code.

The Sewer Utility shall estimate the plan check fee and the inspection fee when plans are first submitted, and this estimated cost shall be deposited before plan check begins.

c.    The Sewer Utility’s inspector shall inspect all facilities installed by the developer’s contractor to insure compliance with the plans and specifications.

d.    Upon completion and acceptance of the work, the Sewer Utility shall prepare a final accounting of the plan checking and inspection and either bill for the additional amount owed or refund excess payments. (Ord. 1039 Sec. 1, 2018)

1.1 AUTHORIZATION

This Ordinance is enacted by the City of Norco (“the City”) pursuant to the authorization of California Government Code Section 54739 et seq., the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403).

1.2 PURPOSE AND POLICY

The purpose of this Ordinance is to provide for the regulation of wastewater discharges to the City’s Sanitary Sewer Wastewater Collection System which are thereafter discharged to the Western Riverside County Wastewater Treatment Plant. The Ordinance authorizes issuance of individual wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires User reporting; and provides for setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. The Ordinance establishes procedures for complying with requirements placed upon the City by local, State of California, and federal regulations. This Ordinance sets forth the requirements for Users of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for the Western Riverside County Regional Wastewater Authority (the “Authority”), and enables the City and the Authority to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (Title 40 CFR Part 403).

The objectives of this Ordinance are:

1.2.1 To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works that will interfere with its operation;

1.2.2 To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;

1.2.3 To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;

1.2.4 To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the POTW;

1.2.5 To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works; and

1.2.6 To enable the Authority to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use, and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject.

1.3 ADMINISTRATION

This Ordinance shall apply to all discharges, whether direct or indirect, to the City’s wastewater system and shall be interpreted in accordance with definitions set forth in Section 1.7 of this Ordinance. This Ordinance provides for the regulation of the quantity and quality of wastewater to be discharged to the regional sewerage system, the degree of waste pretreatment required, the setting of charges to provide for equitable distribution of costs, the issuance of permits for non-domestic wastewater discharge, all other permits as required, and the establishment of penalties for violation of this Ordinance.

It is the intent of this Ordinance to recognize that the City as a Member Agency with a pretreatment program approved by the Authority has the primary responsibility for compliance monitoring and enforcement of the federal, state and locally mandated pretreatment regulations. However, in the event the City does not take appropriate action to enforce Pretreatment standards and Requirements, the Authority has the right to take administrative or legal action. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Administrator may be delegated by the Administrator to a duly authorized individual.

1.4 ORDINANCE IN FORCE

This Ordinance shall be in full force and effect thirty (30) days after final passage thereof.

1.5 DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS/CITY ENGINEER

2.5 DILUTION

No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users who are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

(Ord. 1005 Sec. 2, 2016)

14.08.003 Pretreatment of wastewater.
3.1 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES

Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this Ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out in Section 2.1 of this Ordinance within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the User’s expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Administrator for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Ordinance.

3.2 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES

3.2.1 Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require Users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the User’s compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.

3.2.2 The Director may require any User discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

3.2.3 Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.

Such interceptors shall be installed, cleaned, and repaired by the User at their expense.

3.3 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS

The Director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control Slug Discharges. The Director may require any User to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges. Alternatively, the Director may develop such a plan for any User. An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:

3.3.1 Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;

3.3.2 Description of stored chemicals;

3.3.3 Procedures for immediately notifying the Administrator of any accidental or Slug Discharge, as required by Section 6.6 of this Ordinance; and

3.3.4 Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

3.4.1.2 Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

3.4.1.3 A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 of this Section.

3.4.2 Bypass Notifications

3.4.2.1 If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

3.4.2.2 A User shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

3.4.3 Bypass

3.4.3.1 Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:

3.4.3.2 Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

3.4.3.3 There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

3.4.3.4 The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph D (1) of this section.

6.5.1 The Director may require the User to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 4.5 of this Ordinance.

6.5.2 The Director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under Section 4.7 of this Ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 5.3.1.4 of this Ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.

6.6 Reports of Potential Problems

6.6.1 In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the User.

6.6.2 Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall, unless waived by the Director submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Ordinance.

6.6.3 A notice shall be permanently posted on the User’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in Section 6.6.1, above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

6.6.4 Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge.

6.7 Reports from Unpermitted Users

All Users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director as the Director may require.

6.8 Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting

If sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the Director within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the Authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.

6.9 Analytical Requirements

All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties approved by EPA.

6.10 Sample Collection

Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

6.10.1 Except as indicated in Section 6.10.2 and 6.10.3 below, the User must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24 hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(3).

6.10.2 Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

6.10.3 For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90 day compliance reports required in Section 6.1 and 6.3 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Section 6.4 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(4).

6.11 Date of Receipt of Reports

Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.

6.12 Recordkeeping

Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under Section 6.4. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the City.

6.13 Certification Statements

Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports and Initial Monitoring Waiver—The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in accordance with Sections 4.6; Users submitting baseline monitoring reports under Section 6.1.2.5 (See 40 CFR 403.12 (l)); Users submitting reports on compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines under Section 6.3 (See 40 CFR 403.12(d)); and Users submitting Periodic Compliance Reports required by Section 6.4.1 through 6.4.4 (See 40 CFR 403.12(e)) The following certification statement must be signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section 1.7.3:

(Ord. 1005 Sec. 9, 2016)

14.08.010 Administrative enforcement remedies.
10.1 Notification of Violation

When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the City. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.

10.2 Consent Orders

The Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of this Ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.

10.3 Show Cause Hearing

The Director may order a User which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by certified mail (return receipt requested) at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User as defined in Section 1.7.3 and required by Section 4.6.1. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

10.4 Compliance Orders

When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

10.5 Cease and Desist Orders

When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User’s past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:

10.5.1 Immediately comply with all requirements; and

10.5.2 Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

10.6.1.2 any Permit condition, prohibition or effluent limit; or

10.6.1.3 any Permit suspension or revocation order.

10.6.2 The administrative complaint shall be served by personal delivery or certified mail to the User and shall inform the User that a hearing will be conducted on a date which shall be within sixty (60) days following service. The administrative complaint will allege the act or failure to act that constitutes the violation of the City’s requirements, the provisions of law authorizing civil liabilities to be imposed, and the proposed civil penalty. The matter shall be heard by the City Council. The User to whom an administrative complaint has been issued may waive the right to a hearing, in which case a hearing will not be conducted.

10.6.3 At the hearing, the User shall have an opportunity to respond to the allegations set forth in the administrative complaint by presenting written or oral evidence.

10.6.4 After the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council shall make its determination. Should it find that grounds exist for assessment of a civil penalty against the User, it shall issue a decision and order in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing.

10.6.5 If it is found that the User has violated reporting or discharge requirements, the City Council may assess a civil penalty against the User. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the City Council may take into consideration all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the economic benefit derived through any non-compliance, the nature and persistence of the violation, the length of time over which the violation occurs and corrective action, if any, attempted or taken by the User involved.

10.6.6 Civil penalties may be assessed as follows:

10.6.6.1 In an amount no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day, which shall not exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each day for failing or refusing to furnish technical or monitoring reports;

10.6.6.3 In an amount no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day, which shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation for each day of discharge in violation of any waste discharge limit, Permit condition, or requirement issued, reissued or adopted by the City.

10.6.6.4 In any amount which does not exceed ten dollars ($10) per gallon for discharges in violation of any Permit suspension, Permit revocation, cease and desist order or other orders, or prohibition issued, reissued or adopted by the City.

10.6.6.5 An order assessing administrative civil penalties issued by the City Council shall be final upon issuance.

10.6.6.6 Copies of the administrative order shall be served on the User served with the administrative complaint, either by personal service or by registered mail to the User at his business or residence address, and upon other persons who appeared at the hearing and requested a copy of the order.

10.6.6.7 Any User aggrieved by a final order issued by the City Council, may obtain review of the final order of the City Council in the superior court, pursuant to Government Code, Section 54740.6, by filing with the court a petition for writ of mandate within thirty (30) days following the service of a copy of the decision or order issued by the City Council.

10.6.7 Payment on any order setting administrative civil penalties shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date the order becomes final. The amount of any administrative civil penalties imposed which have remained delinquent for a period of sixty (60) days shall constitute a lien against the real property of the User from which the discharge resulting in the imposition of the civil penalty originated. The lien shall have no effect until recorded with the county recorder. The City may record the lien for any unpaid administrative civil penalties on the ninety-first (91st) day following the date the order becomes final.

10.6.8 No administrative civil penalties shall be recoverable for any violation for which the City has recovered civil penalties through a judicial proceeding filed pursuant to Government Code, Section 54740.

10.6.9 Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

10.7 Non-Compliance Costs

The City shall recover its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in processing notices of violation and in performing sampling, monitoring, or laboratory analysis related to any violations of the Ordinance or Permit by any User.

Non-Compliance costs shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any civil or criminal liability specified in this Ordinance.

10.9 Emergency Suspensions

The Director may immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend a User’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.

10.9.1 Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 10.10 of this Ordinance are initiated against the User.

10.9.2 A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 10.3 or 10.10 of this Ordinance.

Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any Emergency Suspension under this Section.

10.10 Termination of Discharge

In addition to the provisions in Section 5.5 of this Ordinance, any User who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:

10.10.1 Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;

10.10.2 Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

10.10.3 Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;

10.10.4 Refusal of reasonable access to the User’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or

10.10.5 Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section 2 of this Ordinance.

Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 10.3 of this Ordinance why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

(Ord. 1005 Sec. 10, 2016)

14.08.011 Judicial enforcement remedies.
11.1 Injunctive Relief

When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may petition the Riverside County Superior Court through the City’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Ordinance on activities of the User. The Director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.

11.2 Civil Penalties

11.2.1 A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of not less than $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

11.2.2 The Director may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.

11.2.3 In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the User’s violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor as justice requires.

11.2.4 Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.

11.3 Criminal Penalties

Any User who violates any provision of this Ordinance is guilty of a misdemeanor, which upon conviction is punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day in which a violation occurs shall be subject to the penalties contained herein.

11.4 Remedies Nonexclusive

The remedies provided for in this Ordinance are not exclusive. The Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the Director may take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Administrator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant User.

(Ord. 1005 Sec. 11, 2016)

14.08.012 Supplemental enforcement action.
12.1 Penalties for Late Reports

A penalty of $250 may be assessed to any User for each day that a report required by this Ordinance, a permit, or order issued hereunder is late, beginning five days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by the Director to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the Director’s authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late reporting violations.

12.2 Performance Bonds

The Director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of this Ordinance, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless such User first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.

12.3 Liability Insurance

The Director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge to any User who has failed to comply with any provision of this Ordinance, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless the User first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.

12.4 Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties

The Director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit to any User who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this Ordinance, a previous individual wastewater discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder.

12.5 Public Nuisances

A violation of any provision of this Ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement is hereby declared and deemed a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the City. Any violation shall be subject to preliminary or permanent injunctive relief. Any User creating a public nuisance shall be required to reimburse the City for any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying such nuisance.

12.6 Informant Rewards

The Director may pay up to $500 for information leading to the discovery of non-compliance by a User. In the event the information provided results in a civil penalty or administrative fine levied against the User, the Director may reimburse up to 10% of the collected fine or penalty to the Informant; provided, however, a single reward payment may not exceed $2,500.00.

12.7 Illegal Connection

Any connections made to the City’s POTW without complying with this Ordinance and paying all fees and charges required is illegal and a public nuisance. In the event of an illegal connection:

12.7.1 The City may enter the property where the illegal connection is located and disconnect any illegal connection from a sewer line contributory to the City’s POTW. Should disconnection be necessary all costs incurred by the City including reasonable attorneys’ fees shall be recoverable by the City.

12.7.2 At the discretion of the Director, after application for permit is made, the illegal connection may be allowed to continue by first determining that no harm has been done by the connection, and if the connection was properly made.

12.7.3 Any repairs must be fully effected at the sole expense of the User and a penalty of double the permit, inspection and connection fees, as established by the appropriate Rate Resolution, may be assessed by the Director.

12.7.4 In addition, all unpaid sewer charges, assessments, capacity charges or other charges shall be computed from the date the illegal connection was made and shall be paid by the User.

12.8 Protection from Damage

No User shall intentionally or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which is part of the City’s POTW. Any User violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties provided by law. Any User who knowingly makes any false statements, representation, record, report, plan, or other document filed with the City or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties provided by law or in the alternative shall be subject to administrative civil liability under this Ordinance.

12.9 Falsifying Information

Any User who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, record, report, plan or other document filed with the City or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties provided by law or in the alternative, shall be subject to administrative civil liability under this Ordinance.

14.13.020 Notice of testing.
The city may send a “Notice of Testing” to any owner at any address adjacent to any sewer line and for which no sewer connection permit has been issued. Notice of testing shall be sent not less than fourteen days before any such test is conducted for the premises to which the notice has been sent and shall explain the testing program, the opportunity to disclose and prospective costs and charges.

14.13.040 Effective of disclosure.
Upon receipt by the building official of disclosure of a non permitted connection, the city shall thereafter determine if the owner shall remain connected to the sewer system. The property will be disconnected unless:

(1)    The owner proves the existence of a health and safety problem; or

(2)    The city determines that there is sufficient additional capacity in the wastewater treatment capacity available to the city at the time to permit connection to the sewer system.

In any event, the owner shall pay the equivalent of two years back payment plus ten percent interest penalty for prior sewer usage, and in addition, in the event connection is permitted, shall pay for all necessary permit and connection fees. (Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

14.13.050 Request for testing.
Any owner unable to determine whether or not their property is connected to the sewer system may pay a fee of forty dollars to the city which shall conduct a test to determine if the dwelling/building is connected to the sewer.

14.13.060 Non-permitted connections disclosed by testing.
If any property is disclosed as a result of testing to be connected to the sewer system and disclosure was not made per Section 14.13.030 or 14.13.050, and no permit has previously been issued, then the owner shall pay a civil penalty in the amount of twice the cost of the testing which shall be determined by the total cost of such testing conducted in any one calendar month divided by the number of nonpermitted connections disclosed by such testing, plus the cost of administering the program but such amount shall not exceed one thousand dollars.

Additionally, the property will be disconnected unless:

(1)    A resident/owner proves the existence of a health and safety problem; or

(2)    The city determines that there is sufficient additional capacity in the wastewater treatment capacity available to the city at the time to permit connection to the sewer system.

In any event, the owner shall pay the equivalent of two years back payment plus ten percent interest penalty for prior sewer usage, and in addition, in the event connection is permitted, shall pay for all necessary permit and connection fees. (Ord. 533 Sec. 1, 1985: Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

14.13.080 Form of proper service of notice.
Service of the notice shall be by personal service upon the owner of the affected property, or by depositing a copy of the notice in the United States mail enclosed in a sealed envelope and with postage thereon fully prepaid. The notice shall be registered or certified and addressed to the owner, with return receipt requested, and, if there is no known address, then in care of the property address. The service is complete at the time of such deposit. “Owner” as used in this chapter, means any person in possession and also the person(s) shown as owner(s) on the last equalized property tax assessment rolls. The failure of any person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings under this chapter. (Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

14.13.090 Hearing by city manager or duly authorized representative.
At the time stated in the notices, the city manager, or his duly authorized representative shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, objections or protests, and shall receive testimony from owners, witnesses, city personnel and other interested persons relative to such charges. The hearing may be continued from time to time. (Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

14.13.100 Decision by city manager and appeal.
(a)    Upon or after the conclusion of the hearing, the city manager or his duly authorized representative shall, based upon such hearing, determine the correctness of any charges. If the city manager or his duly authorized representative find that any charges are to be assessed pursuant to this chapter, the city manager or his duly authorized representative shall make a written order setting forth his findings and ordering the owner or other person having charge or control of such property to make such payments. A copy of the order of the city manager or his duly authorized representative ordering payment shall be served upon the owners of the property in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.13.070.

14.13.120 Record of cost for testing.
The city manager, or such other city official as may be designated by him, shall keep an account of the cost (including incidental expenses) of testing for each separate lot or parcel of land tested, and shall render an itemized report in writing to the city council showing the cost. The city council shall set the matter for hearing to determine the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such costs. (Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

The decision of the city council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 526 Sec. 1 (part), 1984)

14.13.140 Assessment of costs against property--Lien.
The total cost for testing as so confirmed by the city council, if not paid in full within thirty days, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective lot or parcel of land to which it relates and, upon recordation in the office of the county recorder of a notice of lien, as so made and confirmed, shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such assessment.

(1)    After such confirmation and recordation, a certified copy of such decision shall be sent to the tax division of the county auditor-controller’s office, whereupon it shall be the duty of the auditor-controller to add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against the respective lots and parcels of land for municipal purposes, and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes; or

(2)    After such recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law;

(3)    Such notice of lien for recordation shall be in the form substantially as follows:

(1)    That approximately one-half of the city is connected to public sewers, and the remaining one-half utilizes private on-site disposal systems;

(2)    That our limited sewer capacity in the Corona wastewater treatment plant is nearly exhausted and the city has had a moratorium on residential sewer connection since 1976 due to the limited sewer capacity;

(3)    That due to poor soil conditions and failing septic tanks, the health of our citizens is threatened unless sewer capacity for all city residents and businesses is forthcoming;

(4)    That the economic viability of the city is threatened unless sewer capacity is increased to encourage commercial and economic development within the city;

(5)    That imposition and collection of a wastewater infrastructure facilities fee prior to or upon connection of new residential dwelling units and commercial and industrial buildings to city sewer systems is the most practical and equitable method of providing revenues for construction of the sewage treatment facilities to meet the continuing development needs of the city;

(6)    The fee imposed upon the connection of new residential dwelling units and commercial and industrial buildings to the city’s sewer system is for the purpose of making sewage facilities available to such units and buildings and the amount of the fee imposed is reasonably and directly related to such benefit. (Ord. 824 (part) 2004; Ord. 535 (part), 1985)

This section is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection.

Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record permit card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which the inspection is requested, or for deviating from the plans requiring the approval of the building official.

To obtain a re-inspection, the applicant shall pay the re-inspection fee as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by the City Council.

In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

A.    The following are verbal descriptions of the official jurisdiction placards to be used to designate the condition for continued occupancy of buildings or structures. Copies of actual placards are attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and adopted by reference.

1.    “INSPECTED - Lawful Occupancy Permitted” (Green Placard). The placard describing this condition is to be posted on any building or structure wherein no apparent structural hazard has been found. This placard is not intended to mean that there is no damage to the building or structure. Occupants should always be cautious of potential hazards following any natural or manmade disasters.

2.    “RESTRICTED USE - Off-Limits to Unauthorized personnel” (Yellow Placard) The placard describing this condition is to be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged wherein the damage has resulted in some form of restriction to the continued occupancy. The individual who posts this placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered and will clearly and concisely note the restrictions on continued occupancy.

3.    “UNSAFE - Do Not Enter or Occupy” (Red Placard) The placard describing this condition is to be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged such that continued occupancy poses a threat to life safety. Buildings or structures posted with this placard shall not be entered under any circumstance except as authorized in writing by the building official, or his or her authorized representative. Safety assessment teams shall be authorized to enter these buildings at any time. This placard is not to be used or considered as a demolition order. The individual who posts this placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered.

B.    In addition to the above descriptive conditions, each placard shall also contain the city building and safety division’s address and telephone number along with the number of this city chapter.

C.    Once the placard has been attached to a building or structure, a placard is not to be removed, altered or covered until done so by an authorized representative of the building official or upon written notification from the city building and safety division. It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to alter, remove, cover or deface a placard unless authorized pursuant to this section.”

15.60.005 Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government unit’s authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Norco does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

15.60.010 Findings of Fact
(a)    The flood hazard areas of the City of Norco are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(b)    These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss.

(c)    Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

1.    Protect human life and health;

2.    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3.    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5.    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

6.    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

7.    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

8.    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

(d)    Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to:

1.    Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

2.    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3.    Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

4.    Control fillings, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

5.    Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

15.60.020 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

“Apex” means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the City Manager’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured home are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.)

“Flood, flooding, or flood water” means:

1.    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows); and

2.    The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

“Flood Hazard Boundary Map” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Flood-related erosion” means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.

“Flood-related erosion area” or “Flood-related erosion prone area” means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

“Flood-related erosion area management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see “Flooding”.

“Floodplain Administrator” is the City Manager or their designated individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Flood proofing” means any combination of structural or nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet flood proofing.)

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “Regulatory Floodway”.

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “Regulatory Floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization” as related to Section 6, Variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one-hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Governing body” is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.

“Hardship” as related to Section 6, Variances, of this ordinance means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic adjacent grade” means any structure that is:

1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of the registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3.    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or

4.    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a man-made structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such a closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition).

1.    An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest flood provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

(a)    The wet flood proofing standard in Section 15.60.140 C.3;

(b)    The anchoring standards in Section 15.60.140 A;

(c)    The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.60.140 B; and

(d)    The standards for utilities in Section 15.60.160.

2.    For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “Basement” definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Market Value” shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued deprecation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“Mudslide” describes a condition where there is a river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain.

“Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area” means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

“New construction” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood” - see “Base flood.”

“Public safety and nuisance” as related to Section 15.60.230, Variances, of this ordinance means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1.    Built on a single chassis;

3.    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

4.    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

“Sheet flow area” - see “Area of shallow flooding.”

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2.    Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance.

“Violation” means the failure of structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel, or other topographic feature on or over which water flows at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

15.60.030 Lands to Which This Ordinance Applies
This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Norco.

15.60.040 Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated August 1978, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) dated February 15, 1979, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this ordinance and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 2870 Clark Avenue, City Hall, Norco Department of Public Works.

15.60.050 Compliance

15.60.100 Designation of the Floodplain Administrator
The City Manager is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions.

15.60.110 Duties and Responsibilities of the City Manager
The duties and responsibilities of the City Manager shall include, but not be limited to the following:

A.    Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that:

1.    Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied,

2.    All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained,

3.    The site is reasonably safe from flooding, and

4.    The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has been designated. For purposes of this ordinance, “adversely affects” means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.

B.    Review, Use, and Development of other Base Flood Data.

1.    When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.60.040, the City Manager shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 15.60.140. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption; or

2.    If no base flood elevation data is available from a Federal or State agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 15.60.140.

(a)    Simplified Method

(i)    100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and

(ii)    Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or

(b)    Detailed Method

(i)    100-year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Crops of Engineers’ HEC-HMS computer programs; and

(ii)    Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-RAS computer program.

C.    Notification of other agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse:

1.    Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

2.    Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

3.    Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

D.    Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

1.    Certification required by Sections 15.60.140 C.1 and 15.60.180 (lowest floor elevations),

2.    Certification required by Section 15.60.140 C.2 (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures),

3.    Certification required by Section 15.60.140 C.3 (wet flood proofing standard),

4.    Certification of elevation required by Section 15.60.140 B (subdivision standards),

5.    Certification required by Section 15.60.200 A (floodway encroachments).

E.    Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.60.230.

F.    Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this ordinance as specified in Section 15.60.050.

15.60.130 Standards of Construction
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

A.    Anchoring.

1.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

2.    All manufactured homes hall meet the anchoring standards of Section 15.60.180.

B.    Construction materials and methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed:

1.    With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 2-93, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;

2.    Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;

3.    With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if

4.    Within Zone AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.

C.    Elevation and floodproofing. (See Section 15.60.020 definitions for “Basement,” “Lowest Floor,” “New Construction,” Substantial Damage,” and Substantial Improvement.”)

a.    In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. (The State of California recommends that in AO zones without velocity the lowest floor be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least 2 feet, or elevated at least 4 feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.)

b.    In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 15.60.110 B of this chapter. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community.)

c.    In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation.)

Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

2.    Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.60.140 C.1 or together with attendant utility sanitary facilities:

a.    Be flood proofed below the elevation recommended under Section 15.60.140 C.1 so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

b.    Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and

c.    Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this Section 15.60.140 C.2 are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

3.

Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following minimum criteria:

a    Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; or

b.    Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect.

4.    Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.60.180.

15.60.140 Standards for Utilities
All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:

1.    Infiltration of flood waters into the system, and

2.    Discharge from the systems into flood waters.

On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.

15.60.150 Standards for Subdivisions
1.    All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood.

2.    All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

3.    All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

4.    All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

15.60.160 Standards for Manufactured Homes
1.    All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located:

A.    Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,

B.    In a new manufactured home park or subdivision,

C.    In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or

D.    In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood,

Shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation (the State of California recommends at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation) and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

2.    All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph 15.60.180 A will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the:

A.    Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation (the State of California recommends at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation), or

B.    Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade.

Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.

15.60.170 Standards for Recreational Vehicles
1.    All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Map will either:

A.    Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use - a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions, or

B.    Meet the permit requirements of Section 4 of this ordinance and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured home in Section 15.60.180 A.

15.60.180 Floodways
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.60.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply.

1.    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in [the base] flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

2.    If Section 15.60.200 A is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.60.140.

15.60.190 MUDSLIDE (I.E., MUDFLOW) PRONE AREAS
1.    The Floodplain Administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.

2.    Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to:

A.    The type and quality of soils.

B.    Evidence of ground water or surface water problems,

C.    Depth and quality of any fill,

D.    Overall slope of the site, and

E.    Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope.

3.    Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the Floodplain Administrator shall require that:

A.    A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering;

B.    The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement are adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages;

C.    The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and

D.    Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability.

15.60.200 Flood –Related Erosion –Prone Area
1.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community.

2.    Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard.

3.    If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard.

4.    Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront, or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated “useful life” of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation, and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only.

15.60.210 Variance Procedure
Nature of variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

15.60.220 Appeal Board
In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and the:

1.    Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.    Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.    Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4.    Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.    Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.    Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.    Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.    Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.    Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.    Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11.    Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1.    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and

2.    Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the City Manager in the Office of the Riverside County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

The City Manager will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.

15.60.230 Conditions for Variances
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.60.090 and 15.60.140 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Section 15.60.020 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to the elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1.    Showing of good sufficient cause;

2.    Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” (as defined in Section 15.60.200 of this chapter) to the applicant; and

3.    Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.60.020 - see “Public Safety or Nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.60.020) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, or other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.60.250 A through E are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.60.240 A and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Where unusual conditions or special hazards exist, the City Engineer may require security for grading involving less than 1,000 cubic yards (764.6 m3). Security required by this Section may include incidental off-site grading on property contiguous with the site to be developed, provided written consent of the owner of such contiguous property is filed with the City Engineer.

The City Engineer may waive the requirements for a security for the following:

1.    Grading being done by or for a governmental agency.

2.    Grading necessary to remove a geotechnical hazard,

3.    Grading on a site, not exceeding a slope of three horizontal to one vertical, provided such grading as determined by the City Engineer will not affect drainage from or to adjacent properties.

4.    Filling of holes or depressions, provided such grading will not affect the drainage from or to adjacent properties.

J103.7.3 Amount of Security. The amount of security shall be based on the number of cubic yards of material in excavation or fill, whichever is greater, and the cost of all drainage or other protective devices or work necessary to eliminate potential geotechnical hazards. That portion of the security valuation based on the volume of material in either excavation or fill shall be computed as follows:

A)     100,000 cubic yards or less—50 percent of the estimated cost of grading work, or

B)    Over 100,000 cubic yards—50 percent of the cost of the first 100,000 cubic yards plus 25 percent of the estimated cost of that portion in excess of 100,000 cubic yards.

When the rough grading has been completed in conformance with the requirements of this code, the City Engineer may, at his or her discretion, consent to a proportionate reduction of the security to an amount estimated to be adequate to ensure completion of the grading work, site development or planting remaining to be performed. The costs referred to in this section shall be as estimated by the City Engineer.

1.    Comply with all of the provisions of this code, applicable laws, and ordinances;

2.    Comply with all of the terms and conditions of the grading permit;

3.    Complete all of the work authorized by the permit.

J103.7.5 Term of Security The term of each security shall begin upon the filing with the City Engineer and the security shall remain in effect until the work authorized by the grading permit is completed and approved by the City Engineer.

J103.7.6 Default Procedures. In the event any grading for which a permit has been issued is not completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications for said work or with all terms and conditions of the grading permit, the City Engineer

may declare that a default has occurred. The City Engineer shall give notice thereof to the principal and surety or financial institution executing the security, or to the owner in the case of a cash bond or assignment. The City Engineer may thereafter determine the work that is necessary to mitigate any hazardous or unsafe conditions on the site and cause such work to be performed. Where the security consists of a bond or instrument of credit, the surety or financial institution executing the security shall be responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the City Engineer in causing such work to be performed, up to the full amount of the security. In the case of a cash bond or assignment, the City Engineer may pay all costs and expenses incurred in causing such work to be performed from the funds deposited, and return any unused portion of such deposit or funds to the person making said deposit or assignment.

15.100.010 Purpose
It is found and declared that in the event of a strong or moderate local earthquake, loss of life or serious injury may result from damage to or collapse of buildings in Norco. It is generally acknowledged that Norco will experience earthquakes in the future due to its proximity to Seismic Zone 4. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote public safety by identifying those buildings in Norco which exhibit structural deficiencies and by accurately determining the severity and extent of those deficiencies in relation to their potential for causing loss of life or injury. The City Council finds it desirable to identify the hazards that these deficiencies may pose to occupants of buildings and pedestrians in the event of an earthquake. Such a seismic hazards identification program is consistent with California Health and Safety Code sections 19160--19169, SB 547.

15.100.020 Definitions
(1)    “Bearing wall” means any wall supporting a floor or roof where the total superimposed load exceed one hundred (100) pounds per linear foot, or any unreinforced masonry wall supporting its own weight when over six (6) feet in height.

(2)    “Building,” for the purpose of determining occupant load, means any contiguous or interconnected structure; for purposes of engineering evaluation, means the entire structure or a portion thereof which will respond to seismic forces as a unit.

(3)    “Capacity for transfer” means the maximum allowable capacity of a structural system or connection to resist in a ductile manner the lateral forces it would encounter due to earthquake forces.

(4)    “Civil engineer or structural engineer” means a licensed civil or structural engineer registered by the State of California pursuant to the rules and regulation of Title 16, Chapter 5 of the California Administrative Code.

(5)    “External hazard” means an object attached to or forming the exterior facade of a building which may fall onto pedestrians or occupants of adjacent buildings. Examples of this type of hazard include, but are not limited to, the following:

a.    Nonstructural exterior wall panels, such as masonry infill or decorative precast concrete.

b.    Parapets.

c.    Marquees, awnings or other roof-like projections from a building.

d.    Masonry or stone wall veneer and wall ornamentation, including cornices or other decorative appendages.

e.    Masonry chimneys.

f.    Tile roofing.

(7)    “Occupants” means the total occupant load of a building determined by Table 33-A of the 1988 Uniform Building Code or the actual maximum number of occupants in that building if that number is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the number determined by using Table 33-A. The number of actual occupants may be documented by counting actual seating capacity if permanent seating is provided in the occupancy, or by employee and client counts which can be substantiated as a practical maximum use of the space in the building. The chief building official will establish the procedure for documenting occupant loads.

(8)    “Solution” means any justifiable method that will provide for the transfer of lateral forces through a system or connection to a degree which will substantially eliminate a potential collapse failure. A general description of the methods and materials to be used shall be included in sufficient detail to allow for a cost estimate of the solution to be made (i.e., adding shear walls, over-laying horizontal diaphragms, strengthening critical connections, etc.).

(9)    Unreinforced masonry (URM) building means any building containing walls constructed wholly or partially with any of the following materials:

a.    unreinforced brick masonry.

15.100.050 Engineering Reports
(1)    Preparation of Reports. Building owners shall employ a civil or structural engineer to prepare the investigation and engineering report outlined below.

(2)    Purpose. To investigate, in a thorough and unambiguous fashion, a building’s structural systems that resist the forces imposed by earthquakes and to determine if any individual portion or combination of these systems is inadequate to percent a structural failure (collapse or partial collapse).

(3)    General. Each building shall be treated as an individual case without prejudice or comparison to similar type or age building which may have greater or lesser earthquake resistance. Generalities or stereotypes are to be avoided in the evaluation process by focusing on the specifics of the structural system of the building in question and the local geology of the land on which the building is constructed.

(4)    Level of Investigation. Some buildings will require extensive testing and field investigation to uncover potential structural deficiencies, while others will allow the same level of overall evaluation by a less complicated process due to simplicity of design or the availability of original or subsequent alteration design and construction documents.

It is the responsibility of the engineer performing the evaluation to choose the appropriate level of investigation which will produce a report that is complete and can serve as a sound basis for a conclusion on the collapse hazard the building may present.

(5)    Format for the Report. The following is a basic outline of the format each engineering report should follow. This outline is not to be construed to be a constraint on the professional preparing the report, but rather to provide a skeleton framework within which individual approaches to assembling the information required by the ordinance may be accomplished. It also will serve as a means for the City to evaluate the completeness of each report.

a.    General Information. A description of the building including:

(i)    The street address;

(ii)    The type of occupancy use within the building, with separate uses that generate different occupant loads indicated on a plan showing the square footage of each different use;

(iii)    Plans and elevations showing the location, type and extent of lateral force resisting elements in the building (both horizontal and vertical elements);

(iv)    A description of the construction materials used in the structural elements and information regarding their present condition;

(v)    The date of original construction, if known, and the date, if known, of any subsequent additions or substantial structural alternations of the building; and

(Except Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Types)

(a)    Preliminary Field Survey. Provide drawings of the building in plan, elevation and section sufficiently detailed to reveal the correct dimensions of the spans and extent of all structural elements in the building, including openings in walls and changes in framing directions or other data which will be used to evaluate the building.

(b)    Areas of Special Investigation.

1.    Specify the type of roof diaphragm used in the building and its capacity for transfer of lateral forces.

2.    If the building is multi-story specify the existing floor diaphragm at each level above the foundation and give its capacity for transfer of lateral forces.

3.    Specify the types and spacing of connections used at each level to transfer the forces of the horizontal diaphragms into the vertical shear resisting elements of the structure, and the capacity for transfer of each type of connection present in the building.

4.    Specify the type of vertical structural elements which resist lateral forces and their individual capacities as determined either by testing or use of standard values for the types of construction found in the vertical elements.

5.    Specify the type and spacing of connections used to connect vertical shear resisting elements to each other and to the building foundation, and the capacity for transfer of each type of connection present.

6.    Specify the type of foundation system used and note any evidence of settlement.

7.    Specify the type of connection used to attach wall appendages or precast wall elements to the structural frame.

Standards for the Analysis and Evaluation of All Buildings
(Except Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Types)

(a)    Purpose. The objective of these investigations is to identify and quantify the structural inadequacies that may be present in a building which could lead to a collapse or partials collapse during an earthquake. The focus of the reports should be 1) determining the potential life safety threat that the building presents to its occupants and 2) the potential threat to pedestrians or occupants of adjacent buildings from falling external hazards.

(b)    Capacity vs. Demand of the Existing Structural System and Its Elements.

1.    Define the overall type of lateral force resisting system used in the building based on Table 23-I of the 1973 Uniform Building Code. If the building has a dual or hybrid system, describe the systems and explain how they function both in combination and separately to justify the “K” factor to be chosen.

2.    For each type of diaphragm, shear wall, moment frame, braced frame and interconnection of lateral force resisting systems provide an analysis of the loads (demand) which these elements would be subject to based on the design parameters set forth in the 1973 edition of the Uniform Building Code.

3.    For each type of diaphragm, shear wall, frame and interconnection of lateral force resisting system determine a maximum capacity based on currently accepted or published allowable values, adjusted as appropriate for the material involved when used to resist earthquake forces.

4.    Provide a ratio of capacity to demand for each system or interconnection evaluated in (2) and (3) above and provide a statement of the significance of this ratio, regarding the potential for failures which could lead to a collapse, considering the materials used and the type of lateral force resisting system present.

(c)    Specific Evaluation Items. The report shall contain a statement regarding the significance of each item in this section which is found to occur in the building.

(1)    General.

A.    Assess the condition of the structure, the quality of workmanship, the level of maintenance and the type of construction with regard to the potential loss of strength in the structural systems due to decay or deterioration.

B.    Assess the redundancy exhibited in the structural system and the reserve capacity that elements of the system may provide.

C.    Assess the presence or lack of ductility in the lateral force resisting elements and ductility differences due to the use of dissimilar materials in the horizontal and vertical diaphragms.

D.    Assess how adequately the building is tied together in an overall sense to allow the lateral force resisting systems an opportunity to receive the forces they are designed to resist.

(2)    Geometry.

A.    Consider how and where torsional (rotation) forces, induced by the eccentricity of the building center of mass to its center of rigidity, are taken into the lateral force resisting system and identify the individual elements which will transmit these additional forces. Assess the potential capacity these elements have to resist the additional loads from this source.

B.    Consider the effects of discontinuities in the lateral force resisting systems with regard to the existence of adequate ties, boundary members, chords or drag struts, etc. to allow redistribution of forces. Assess the capacity of the systems or elements which would receive the redistributed forces if adequate ties exist.

C.    Consider the effects of reentrant corners (including the shape of individual columns) and assess their contribution to the response of the building at locations where they occur.

(3)    Building Separation.

A.    Consider the effects of adjoining buildings, which may have different vibration periods resulting in nonsynchronized movement of the adjacent exterior walls, placing out of plane impact forces on these walls.

B.    Assess the level of drift control, particularly at open storefronts and the actual physical separation distance between the exterior walls of the building and adjoining building walls.

C.    Assess condition where the wall of a building on one property provides support for structural elements of the adjoining property’s building.

(4)    Non-Ductile Reinforced Concrete Frames.

A.    Consider non-ductile frames which act alone without the benefit of shear walls or braced frames.

B.    Assess the level of compression or shear forces due to existing vertical loads on the critical supporting elements of the frame.

C.    Assess masonry infill walls between frame members and their effect on the forces a column/beam joint will be subjected to when attempting to transmit lateral forces into these walls.

(5)    Precast Concrete Connections

A.    Assess the effects of temperature creep and shrinkage of concrete surrounding welded insert connections to precast systems and elements.

B.    Consider the potential brittle failure of such connections.

(6)    Non-Structural Elements.

A.    Assess the effect that partitions, infill walls, precast concrete exterior (architectural) elements and ceiling systems, which have considerable strength and stiffness characteristics, may have on the overall response of the building.

B.    Assess the effect of inadvertent bracing by nonstructural elements such as infill walls, stair stringers or other situations of localized restraint on columns.

C.    Assess the potential stress concentrations at the unrestrained ends of columns which may result from partial restraint or bracing of columns.

(7)    Site Geology.

A.    Consider the maximum ground shaking intensity for the building site and liquefaction potential or susceptibility by using available earthquake hazard maps.

B.    Assess any existing site specific geology/soils reports to gauge the effects that the local conditions may have on the overall response of the building.

APPENDIX B
Procedures for Investigation of Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings

(b)    Special investigations of the following nature must be made:

1.    Note all parts of the vertical load-carrying system that may act as ties to lateral load-resisting elements, to determine the elements or systems that may control relative displacements between the building’s base, floors and roof.

2.    Note on floor plans all interior crosswalls that are continuous between floors or floor and roof, even if the connection of such walls to the floor or roof is only by finishes.

3.    Draw the relationship of roof or floor framing and ceiling framing to determine the extent and method if any, of their inter-connection.

4.    Draw the support systems for URM walls that are not continuous to the building base noting the materials used to provide that support. (i.e., steel, frame, concrete frame, etc.)

5.    Draw on floor and roof plans the extent of sheathing and finish materials and describe their nature and nailing pattern. Note any difference in materials used which could lead to substantial variations in diaphragm stiffness. Opening if floors or roof adjacent to URM walls must be noted. Note the type of roofing system currently in place and note if this roofing is applied directly to the main roof deck or if there are locations where it is on a cricket or other superimposed deck.

(c)    Investigation of current anchorage of URM walls to floors and roof. Show the location of all wall anchors on the floor/roof plans and specify their spacing, size, and method of connection. Details of the existing anchorage system should be prepared. Embedded portions of anchors must be exposed to determine this level of detail. A minimum of 2 percent or 2 anchors exposed per floor or roof level should establish average conditions.

(d)    Investigation of existing URM walls. Investigate the following items it they occur in the building, and determine:

1.    The thickness of URM walls at all levels and location of any changes in thickness.

2.    The materials used for lintels and masonry arches and their bearing area on columns or piers.

3.    The materials used in columns or piers supporting lintel beams or arches.

4.    The height of parapets, cornices, and gable ends of URM walls above the uppermost existing anchorages.

6.    The coursing of exterior wythes of masonry, the bonding of wythes of masonry, and the materials used in each wythe.

7.    The condition of mortar joints and areas of lightly unburned brick should be noted on the wall elevations. Existing cracks in wall elements should also be noted.

(e)    Testing. The testing of existing anchorage systems must be made to determine an average capacity. Testing shall be accomplished in accordance with the following requirements.

1.    Existing Wall Anchors of URM Buildings. Ten (10) percent of existing rod anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved testing laboratory. The minimum tested quantity shall be four (4) per floor or roof level, with two (2) tests at walls with framing perpendicular to the walls and two (2) at walls with framing parallel to the wall. The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested. Where due to obstructions this is not possible, details of the condition encountered and the alternate method used must be included in the test result report, with calibration adjustment for conditions where the reaction of the test apparatus contributes to the tension value of the anchor.

The rod anchor shall be given a preload of 300 pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load reported shall be recorder at 1/8" relative movement of the anchor to the adjacent masonry wall surface.

The testing of existing URM walls to determine the allowable bed-joint shear is required in accordance with the following requirements.

(2)    In Place Shear Tests of Brick Masonry. The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. Steel bearing plates of the full dimension of the brick shall be inserted at each end of the test jack. The bearing plates shall not contact the mortar joint. The minimum quality mortar in 80 percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of 30 psi when reduced to an equivalent zero axial stress.

The minimum quantity of tests shall be two (2) per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force (i.e., per story) or one (1) per 1,500 square feet of total URM wall surface, with a minimum of 8 tests for any building. The tests should be conducted at least two brick courses above or below the bond course and be distributed vertically to include a variety of dead load surcharge situations. The exact test location shall be determined at the building site by the engineer responsible for the investigation and the distribution of such tests must be approved by the building official prior to actual testing. In single story buildings, the wall above the lintel beam at an open storefront need not be tested.

Standards for the Analysis and Evaluation of Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings.

(a)    Analysis

1.    General. The total lateral seismic forces should be computed in accordance with the following equation:

V = IKCSW

The value of KCS need not exceed the value set forth in Table B1-1. The value of I shall be equal to 1.0 The value of W shall be as set forth in the Uniform Building Code.

2.    Lateral Forces on Elements of Structures. Parts or portions of buildings and structures shall be analyzed for lateral loads in accordance with Chapter 23 of the UBC but not less that the value of the following equation:

Fp = ICpSWp

For the provisions of this section, the product of IS need not exceed 1.0. The value of Cp and Wp shall be as set forth in the UBC.

Exception: Unreinforced masonry walls may be analyzed in accordance with Section (b). (Ord. 619, Sec. 14, 1990)

3.    The elements of buildings required to be analyzed shall include the following:

Wall height to thickness ratio.

Tension bolts for bending.

In-plane shear forces.

Parapets.

Diaphragm stress and diaphragm chords at floors and roof.

4.    Anchorage and Interconnection. Anchorage and interconnection of all parts, portions and elements of the structure shall be analyzed for lateral forces in accordance with the UBC and the formula in Subsection 2 above. Masonry walls shall be anchored to all floors or roof to resist a minimum of 200 pounds per linear foot or load per analyses acting normal to the wall at the level of the floor or roof or will be considered inadequate.

5.    Required Analysis. Except as modified herein, the analysis and recommended structural alteration of the structure shall be in accordance with the analysis specified in the UBC. A complete, continuous load path from every part or portion of the structure to the ground shall be shown to exist for required lateral forces. All parts, portions or elements of the structure shall be shown to be interconnected by positive means.

6.    Analysis Procedure. Stresses in materials and existing construction utilized to transfer seismic forces from the ground to parts or portions of the structure shall conform to those permitted by the UBC and those types of materials of construction specified under the Materials of Construction Section (b). In addition to the seismic forces required, unreinforced masonry walls shall be analyzed as specified in the UBC to withstand all vertical loads. When calculating shear or diagonal tension stresses due to seismic forces, existing masonry shear walls may be allowed to resist 1.0 times the required forces in lieu of the 1.5 factor required by the UBC. No allowable tension stress will be permitted in unreinforced masonry walls. Walls not capable of resisting the required design forces specified in this appendix shall be deemed inadequate.

Exception: Unreinforced masonry walls which carry no design loads other than their own weight may be considered as veneer if they are adequately anchored to elements which are not part of the existing lateral force resisting system.

7.    Existing Materials. When stress in existing lateral force resisting elements are due to a combination of dead loads plus live loads plus seismic loads, the allowable working stress specified in the UBC may be increased 100 percent. However, no increase will be permitted in the stresses allowed in Section (b). The stresses in members due only to seismic and deal loads shall not exceed the values permitted in the UBC.

8.    Allowable Reduction of Bending Stress by Vertical Load. Calculated tensile fiber stress may be reduced by the full direct stress due to vertical deal loads.

(b)    Materials of Construction.

1.    General. All materials permitted by this code, including their appropriate allowable stresses and those existing configurations of materials specified herein, may be utilized to shoe adequacy of existing construction.

2.    Existing Materials. Unreinforced masonry walls analyzed in accordance with this appendix may provide vertical support for roof and floor construction and resistance to lateral loads. The bonding of such walls shall be as specified in the UBC.

Tension stresses due to seismic forces acting normal to the wall may be neglected if the wall does not exceed the Height to Thickness ratio and the in-plane shear stresses due to seismic loads set forth in Table B1-2. If the Wall Height or Length to Thickness ratio exceeds the specified limits, the wall will be considered inadequate unless braced by vertical members designed to satisfy the requirements of the UBC. The deflection of such bracing members at design loads shall not exceed one-tenth of the wall thickness.

Exception: The wall may be supported by flexible vertical bracing members designed in accordance with this appendix if the deflection at design spacing of vertical bracing members shall not exceed one-half the unsupported height of the wall or ten feet, whichever is less.

3.    Existing Roof, Floors, Walls, Footings and Wood Framing. Existing materials, including wood shear walls may be used as part of the lateral load resisting system, provided that the stresses in these materials do not exceed the values shown in Table B1-3. Wood shear walls may be recommended to strengthen portions of the existing seismic resisting system.

4.    Minimum Acceptable Quality of Existing Unreinforced Masonry Walls. All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry vertical loads and seismic forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane shall be tested as specified in Section (e) of the investigation portion of this appendix. All masonry shall be of a quality not less than the minimum standards established or shall be considered inadequate. Pointing of mortar of all masonry wall joints may be performed prior to testing if joints are raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar shall be Type S or N, except masonry cements shall not be used. All preparation and pointing shall be done under the continuous inspection of a special inspector, whose reports shall be included in the final report.

5.    Determination of Allowable Stresses for Design Methods Based on Test Results. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall be related to test results in accordance with Table B1-4. Intermediate values between 3 and 10 psi may be interpolated. Compression stresses for unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of 3 psi shall not exceed 100 psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be permitted.

6.    Construction Details. All unreinforced masonry walls shall be anchored at all floors and roof with tension bolts through the wall or by existing rod anchors at a maximum spacing of six feet. All existing rod anchors shall be secured to the joists to develop the required forces. Testing of the existing rod anchors shall be conducted according to Section (e) of the investigation portion of this appendix.

Diaphragm chord stresses of horizontal diaphragms shall be developed in existing materials or be considered inadequate.

Where trusses or beams other than rafters and joists are supported on masonry piers, these piers must be shown to provide adequate support during seismic loading. (Ord. 619, Sec. 14, 1990)

Parapets and exterior wall appendages not capable of resisting the forces specified in this appendix shall be considered hazardous, and the methods for proper anchorage must be developed.

17.14.02 Purpose, Intent, and Definitions
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Subdivision Map Act. The park and recreation facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this ordinance are in accordance with the Master Plan for Parks, Recreation and Open Space Element of the General Plan of the City of Norco, as adopted by the City. (Ord. 782, 2001).

17.14.04 Requirements
General Standard. It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience; health; welfare, and safety require that five (5) acres of property for each 1, 000 persons residing within the City of Norco be devoted to local park and recreational purposes.

17.14.06 Formula for Dedication of Land
The subdivider shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. A typical acre of the buildable land shall have a slope less than 10% and land graded within one tenth of a foot of finish graded pad. Buildable land shall be located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula.

(1)    The City Council, or the City Council designee, shall approve the land to be dedicated to be made pursuant to this section.

(2)    The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows:

DUs x Pop. x 5 acres = Minimum acre dedication

DU 1,000 people

where:

DUs = Number of dwelling units in subdivision

Pop. = population per dwelling unit as determine by the last estimate

DU provide by the latest Federal Census

(3)    The number of new dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the subdivision map.

17.14.08 Formula for Fees In –Lieu of Land Dedication
General Formula. If it is determined that a land dedication is not in the best interests of the residents of the subdivision and the City, the subdivider shall in lieu of dedicating land pay a fee equal to the value of that land, such fee to bear a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future residents of the area being subdivided.

Subdivisions containing fifty (50) parcels or less shall be required to only pay in-lieu fee and shall be exempt from the requirement of land dedication. The in-lieu fee shall be paid to the City at the time the final map for the subdivision is recorded, unless conditioned otherwise.

(1)    Use of Money. The money collected hereunder shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the residents of the subdivision.

17.14.10 Criteria for Requiring both Dedication and Fee
The subdivider may be required to both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof at the determination of the City Council. The formulas that have been established for land dedication and the amount of fee in lieu of land dedication shall be utilized.

(1)    Amount of Fee In Lieu of Land Dedication: When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land that would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section 17.14.06 (2). The fee shall be determined by the following formula, with the evaluation based on land that has a slope less than 10% and graded within one tenth of a foot of finish graded pad, where building is not excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions:

Min. Acre Dedication x FMV = In Lieu Fee

Buildable acre

where:

FMV =fair market value

Buildable acre = a typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope less than 10% and graded within one tenth of a foot of finish graded pad, located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions.

Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be approved by the City Council, or the City Council designee.

17.14.12 Determination of Fair Market Value
The fair market value shall be determined by the City Council, or the City Council designee, based on unimproved land with a written appraisal report prepared and signed by a certified MAI appraiser (to be paid by the subdivider). The City shall review the qualifications of the MAI appraiser prior to the appraisal of the land. The appraisal shall be made prior to the filing of the final map being recorded. The subdivider shall notify the Director of the expected filing date at least six (6) weeks prior to the filing of the final map, if more than one (1) year elapses prior to filing of the final map and the date of the appraisal, the subdivider shall have a new appraisal prepared. The determination of the fair market value of a buildable acre shall consider, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

1.    Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map.

2.    General Plan designation of the land.

3.    Zoning classification of the property.

4.    Location of the property.

5.    Site characteristics of the property.

If the subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, the determination may be appealed to the City Council. The burden of proof as to the fair market value of the land shall lie with the subdivider.

17.14.14 Determination of Land and Fee
Whether the City Council accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:

1.    The natural features, access, and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication.

2.    The size and shape of the subdivision and the land available for dedication.

3.    The usability and function of the land for park and recreation purposes.

4.    The feasibility of dedication, from an acceptability and suitability aspect.

5.    The compatibility of dedication with the Master Plan for Parks, Recreation and Open Space Element.

6.    The location of existing and proposed park sites and trails.

7.    The current and future recreational needs of the community.

8.    The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final.

17.14.16 Disposition of Fees
The Quimby Act requires the City to develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where the City will use the land or fees to develop park and recreation facilities, and includes required provisions for repayment of fees not committed within five years.

Disposition of Fees. Fees determined pursuant to Section 17.14.08 shall be paid to the City and shall be deposited into the Park Development Fund. Money in this fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition or development of parkland, or improvements for recreational facilities.

Collected fees shall be appropriated by the City for a specific project to reasonably serve the residents of the subdivision within five years upon receipt of payment, or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs first.

If such fees are not so committed, these fees, less an administrative charge, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lots bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision.

The Director of Finance shall report to the City Council at least annually on income, expenditures, and the status of the Park Development Fund.

17.14.18 Exemptions
The provisions of the ordinance do not apply to a commercial or industrial subdivision, unless it is used for residential development. If commercial or industrial property is allowed by the City to be used for residential purposes, the provisions of this chapter shall apply.

17.14.20 Subdivider –Provided Park and Recreation Improvements
The value of park and recreation improvements excluding those improvements as noted in Section. 17.14.06 provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land may be credited against the fees or dedication of land required by this ordinance. The City Council reserves the right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable.

17.16.150 Modifications.
When modifications in the tentative design are conditions of approval of a tentative map, the subdivider shall, prior to the submission of a final map, submit six copies of the tentative map as modified to the city council for approval. (Ord. 233 Sec. 4.15, 1972)

17.16.160 Revised tentative maps.
Any revised tentative map or portion thereof shall comply with the requirements in effect at the time such revised map is considered by the city council. Such revised tentative map or portion thereof shall show all the information and requirements of this title insofar as any changes that may have been made on the map. The approval or conditional approval by the city council of any revised tentative map shall not be construed as extending the time within which the final map shall be filed. (Ord. 233 Sec. 4.16, 1972)

17.16.170 Time extension on approved maps.
(a)    The approval of a tentative map shall expire after twenty-four months, unless within that period of time a final map has been filed with the county recorder, or the land divider has applied in writing to the City Council to extend the time.

Within twenty days after receipt of such written request, the department or agency receiving the request shall issue a written report as to the compliance or noncompliance of the final map as to the matters coming under its jurisdiction, together with a statement of the changes necessary thereon to cause such map to comply. These reports shall be transmitted to the planning director and he shall include them with his transmittal to the city council. Failure of any department or agency to issue a report after written request of the city engineer shall be deemed approval by such department or agency. (Ord. 233 Sec. 5.12, 1972)

17.20.130 Approval.
After the final map has been found to be in substantial compliance with the tentative map and is in correct form and the matters shown thereon are sufficient, the city engineer shall endorse his approval thereon and transmit the map to the planning director together with the plans and specifications of proposed improvements. After the planning director has received the final map and improvement plans from the city engineer and is satisfied that all of the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act, this title and the conditions of approval have been met, he shall transmit the map to the city council together with the plans, specifications, and such other material as may be required to enable the city council to act on the map.

The city council shall, at its next regular meeting after receipt of the final map, act on the map and, if it approves the final map and land division, it shall accept or reject each offer of dedication accordingly and shall accept all bonds and other material.

(Ord. 559 Sec. 3 (part), 1986)

17.34.020 Purpose and intent.

17.34.090 Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map.
(a)    The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2.

However, if the Government Code Section 66474.2 is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.

The amount of the fees prescribed by said ordinances, policies and standards shall be determined at the time of building permit issuance.

(b)    Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:

(c)    The rights referred to in this chapter shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 17.34.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:

(1)    An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

(2)    The initial time period set forth in subsection (c) (1) shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed.

(3)    A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection (c) (1) expires. Said extension request may be approved by the city council, provided no substantial changes in circumstances have occurred.

(4)    If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (c) (1) through (c) (3), the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit. (Ord. 559 Sec. 3 (part), 1986)

17.34.100 Development inconsistent with zoning--Conditional approval.
(a)    Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map.

18.13.02 Intent and Purpose.
It is hereby found and declared that the City of Norco lies in a natural setting of rural, scenic and historical beauty; that this rural environment generates a strong characteristic for development of Norco as a new equestrian focal point in southern California; that this unique rural environment and historically significant location contributes a material economic advantage to the citizens, businesses, and industries within the City and particularly to the property owners who reside therein; and that development in an orderly manner with compatible uses and appearances of structures within and between zones and with the natural rural environment is necessary to maintain such historic and economic advantage, to stabilize, protect, and maintain property values, and to encourage permanence of desirable residential areas.

This zone is intended to provide and encourage the development of agriculturally oriented low-density living areas designed to take advantage of the rural environment, as well as the outdoor recreation potential of the community by maintaining contiguous undeveloped open land on each and every residential lot.

Said numerical suffixes shall designate the required minimum lot size in either thousands of feet, or in number of acres. Any numerical suffix of 20 or more shall mean thousands of square feet; any numerical suffix of less than 20 shall mean acres. For example:

A-1-20 = 20,000-square-foot minimum lot size (*see note below);

A-1-2 = two-acre minimum lot size;

A-1-5 = five-acre minimum lot size; etc.

*    A-1-20 shall refer to all lots created before the effective date of Ordinance No. 977, when the minimum lot size was 20,000 square feet, and to all lots created after the effective date of Ordinance No. 977 and the minimum lot size is 21,780 square feet net.

Such exception shall be incorporated into the approved site plan. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.16 Development Standards (off-site).
Streets serving property within the HS zone shall be designed to minimize grading. To meet these goals, the following criteria are to be incorporated into the development plans to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.

(1)    Street width:

(a)    Through streets may be reduced to 50 foot right-of-way with pavement width of 32 feet provided a trail system be either designed into the street right-of-way or if not possible, an alternative system within an improved common open space network created under the provisions of this Chapter.

(b)    Cul-de-sac and loop streets may be reduced to 40 feet right-of-way, with pavement width of 22 feet provided parking bays are provided at intervals that will reasonably service the area. In such case, three parking spaces shall be provided for every two lots being served.

(c)    Split level streets shall have pavement widths at least 16 feet for each direction of traffic and the median strips to be landscaped and irrigated or other means to control erosion provided.

(2)    Street Design:

(a)    Street alignments and grades shall conform to natural topography and shall accommodate views.

(b)    Centerline curve radii shall not be reduced below 150 feet unless otherwise recommended by the City Engineer.

(c)    Streets should be located on contours and intermediate ridgelines and should avoid skylines, mountain tops, natural water courses, significant rock outcroppings and mature trees wherever possible.

(d)    Hillside streets should avoid being designed at right angles to contour lines except where necessary to provide for streets within canyons or other similar geological features.

(e)    Split level and reduced width streets are encouraged where they will minimize cut and fill operations.

(3)    Trails: Innovative trail systems are encouraged and may be treated independently of the street pattern. On trails on steep grades of over 15%, low barriers may be installed across the trail and filled on the higher side to reduce erosion. Railroad ties are recommended for this purpose. Spacing may be no closer than every 20 feet. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.18 Grading.
The purpose of the grading regulations are to reduce grading and minimize scarring of natural hillside areas on both private property and street right-of-way. To meet this, the following criteria shall be used in grading plans:

(1)    Transition to natural slopes: At the intersection of a manufactured cut or fill slope and a natural slope, a gradual transition of contours with a minimum radius of 50 feet shall be provided. Manufactured banks intersecting at or near right angles at building pads shall be rounded with a radius of no less than 25 feet unless retaining walls are used.

(2)    Intersection of graded slopes with street or trail beds: Where manufactured banks approach street or trails at or near right angles to the bed, the slope shall be flattened at the point of intersection to a ratio of 3-1 or flatter.

(3)    Maximum graded slope: The maximum graded slope shall be two feet horizontal to one foot vertical. A slope of one and one-half foot horizontal to one foot vertical may be permitted if approved by the Planning Commission and City Engineer, and a soils report verifying the stability of the slope is submitted to the City. Graded slopes in excess of 100 feet in length should have curvilinear configurations. Linear slopes shall be avoided.

(4)    Design:    Design considerations with respect to grading, should include rock and soil exposure, size of building pads, and materials and building arrangement.

(5)    Variation: The Planning Commission may permit or require variation to these regulations if a finding is made that such variation will reduce grading or the variation is compatible with the intent of this zone. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.20 Animal Keeping.
(1)    Numbers Permitted: The maximum number of animal units (AU), as defined elsewhere in this Code shall be based on the average natural slope as using the formula contained in Section 18.26.10. The maximum number of animals based on an apportionment per acre shall be as follows:

Average Natural Slope

Maximum Number of AU Per 40,000 square foot lot*

0--9.9%

4.0

10--19.9%

3.00

20--29.9%

2.00

30--39.9%

1.00

40--+

0.5

*Note: Allowable animal units shall be permitted based on lot size rounded to nearest 5000 square foot increment.

(2)    The Planning Commission may permit additional animals pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 18.45 (Conditional Use Permit) for projects sponsored by the 4-H and Future Farmers of America or other similar youth oriented organization.

(3)    Recordation: As required in Section 18.26.12, the maximum number of animal units permitted shall be recorded with each lot.

(4)    Facilities: To insure that the development of animal keeping facilities do not visually detract from the physical setting of the area the following is required:

(a)    For each animal unit allowed, a minimum pad area of 240 square feet shall be provided with a finished slope not to exceed 10 percent. For each animal unit over one, there shall be provided a pad area of 100 square feet. The cutting of pad areas shall be subject to the discretionary approval of the Planning Commission, however, in no case shall pad areas be cut from hillside areas where the ungraded slope exceeds 20%. The property owner shall provide a plot plan and any other information required by the Planning Department.

(b)    No barn, shelter, corral, pen, coop, or other enclosure with a roof area greater than 120 square feet for the purpose of keeping large animals, rabbits, fowl, or poultry or other animals, shall be constructed on a finished or natural slope greater than 10%. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.22 Specific Plan.
To assure that the requirements of this chapter are properly met and the area is comprehensively planned, a Specific Plan as authorized in the California Government Code (commencing with Section 65450) and processed in the manner set forth in Chapter 18.52 (Specific Plan) of this Code must be in effect prior to the approval of any subdivision of land or grading of property entailing more than 25,000 cubic yards within at least a ten acre area, or a grading project that the City Engineer determines will have a long-term effect on the future land use of the area. Notwithstanding the above, the City Council may waive the requirements of a Specific Plan if it is found that the proposed project will not substantially affect the long-range planning within the zone district, not be detrimental to adjacent properties, nor require extensive off-site improvements. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.24 Density.
Housing density shall be based on the sufficiency of public facilities such as roads, water, sewer, drainage, schools, and the average natural slope as contained in the following table:

Average Natural Slope Categories

Maximum No. Lots per Acre

0--9.9%

1.5

10--19.9%

1.0

20--29.9%

0.75

30--39.9%

0.50

40--+

0.25

Average natural slope shall be based on a slope analysis map showing bands of slopes based on intervals of 10% average natural slope up to 40% slope or greater. This slope analysis map may be accomplished either by using the average natural slope formula contained in Sections 18.26.10 within sub areas of the project area as approved by the Planning Commission or using any standard engineering practice as approved by the City Engineer. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.26.26 Site Development.
Site development on legal lots of record is permitted without an adopted Specific Plan provided the development standards of the code are met. However, in either circumstance, to insure that the intent of the HS zone and any applicable Specific Plans are met, the following reviews are necessary prior to the development of any legal parcel of record:

(1)    Site Plan Review: Site Plan approval as specified in Chapter 18.40 (SITE PLAN REVIEW) shall be required for all main use structures, accessory structures over 1000 square feet in floor area or greater than 15 feet in height, and the grading of animal keeping areas over 1000 square feet.

(2)    Architectural Review: Architectural approval as specified in Chapter 18.41 (ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW) shall also be required for all main use structures, and accessory structures over 1000 square feet in floor area or greater than 15 feet in height prior to the issuance of building permits. In addition to the criteria of Chapter 18.41, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:

(a)    Housing: Split level housing design is encouraged to minimize grading.

(b)    Fencing: Private fences shall be architecturally compatible throughout any given project, and generally compatible with surrounding developments. The type, color, and height of fencing be specified by the developer and approved by the City. (Amended by Ord. 513 Sec. 7 (part), 1984)

18.39.10    Restoration of a Damaged Structure.

18.39.12    Amortization of Non-Conforming Uses.

18.39.02 Intent and Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide the limitations for the expansion and continuation of non-conforming uses and structures.

18.39.04 Continuation and Maintenance.
(1)    A use lawfully occupying a structure or a site, that does not conform with the regulations for the zone in which it is located shall be deemed to be a non-conforming use. The use may be continued, except as provided in this chapter.

(2)    A structure, lawfully occupying a site, that does not conform with the standards for front yard, side yards, rear yard, height, coverage, distances between structures, and parking facilities for the district in which the structure is located, shall be deemed to be a non-conforming structure. The structure may be used and maintained, except as provided in this chapter.

(3)    On any non-conforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use, ordinary repairs may be done. However, substantial activity or repairs that require a building permit exceeding 10 percent of the current replacement cost of the structure shall not be allowed.

(4)    If a non-conforming structure becomes physically unsafe due to lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe by reason of physical conditions, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, rebuilt, or occupied except in conformity with the requirements of the zone in which it is located.

(5)    A single family residence that is non-conforming because it does not conform with the standards for parking facilities may be enlarged, altered, or moved to another portion of the lot, and shall not be required to provide a garage as long as adequate on-site parking area exists.

18.39.06 Non-Conforming Uses.
A non-conforming use is one which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance, but which is no longer permitted. Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zones involved. The continuance of a legal non-conforming use is subject to the following:

(1)    A non-conforming use shall not be enlarged, altered, or moved to another portion of the lot unless approved by a conditional use permit.

(2)    If a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of 180 days or more, it shall lose its legal non-conforming status.

18.39.08 Non-Conforming Structures.
A non-conforming structure is one that is prohibited under the terms of the current zoning ordinance, but was lawful when constructed. The non-conformity could be by reasons of restrictions on area, height of structure, setbacks, distance between structures, parking facilities or other requirements concerning the structure.

A non-conforming structure may remain if it stays in the same use. Non-conforming structures may be enlarged, altered or moved only if the proposed structure meets zone code regulations.

18.39.10 Restoration of a Damaged Structure.
Whenever a non-conforming structure, or non-conforming use of a structure, is destroyed by fire or other calamity, or by act of God to the extent of 50 percent or less, the structure may be rebuilt with the non-conformity resumed. The rebuilding must be started within one year and diligently pursued to completion. If the destruction exceeds 50 percent, the non-conforming structure cannot be rebuilt and a non-conforming use shall not be resumed, unless it meets the following criteria:

A.    Building permits are approved for the reconstruction within six months of the destruction.

B.    Building is in a residential zone or is a residential building in a commercial zone.

C.    The continuation of any uses in the building destroyed shall only be for legal and legal non-conforming uses that existed prior to destruction.

E.    The structure to be replaced shall have been a legally-constructed structure per zoning and building codes as they existed when the structure was built as ascertained by a history of building permits or City records as best as can be determined. If building permits or records do not exist for a destroyed structure in question, the Building Official and/or Planning Director shall have the responsibility of determining if the structure was legally built or not and thereby be eligible (or not) for a rebuild permit.

The extent of damage shall be based on the cost of restoring the structure to the estimated value of structure prior to damage. Estimates shall be made by or shall be reviewed and approved by the Building Official. (Ord. 940 Sec. 1, 2012)

(b)    The notice of time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of hearing; and the title of such notice shall consist of the words “Notice of Hearing on Proposed Similar Use” in larger type than that used for the balance of the notice.

(4)    Commission Public Hearing and Resolution:

(a)    The Commission shall not less than ten (10) days after the publication of the legal notice of a public hearing on a proposed similar use hold said public hearing.

(b)    Within thirty-five (35) days after the close of the public hearing, the Commission shall make findings that all the following conditions do or do not exist in relation to the proposed use in the particular zone within which it is proposed, to be located:

(i)    It is not inconsistent with the purposes and intent of this Ordinance;

(ii)    It is similar to one or more uses permitted in the zone within which it is proposed to be located;

(iii)    Its operation is compatible with other permitted uses within said zone;

(iv)    It will not cause substantial injury or impair the present or potential use of the properties in said zone;

(v)    It will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience and welfare of the community;

(vi)    It will not generate substantial additional traffic congestion over other permitted uses in said zone; and

(vii)    It will not adversely affect the intent of the City’s General Plan.

(c)    If the Commission makes findings that all said conditions enumerated in subparagraph (b) above do so exist, it shall state its reasons therefor and by the same resolution include the proposed use as a permitted one within the zone in which it was proposed or requested to be included. A copy of said resolution shall be filed with the City Clerk within three (3) days of its adoption date. If the Commission makes findings that all said conditions enumerated in subparagraph (b) herein do not so exist, it shall state its reasons therefor in said resolution. Such a resolution shall be filed in the office of City’s Planning Director.

(5)    Council Action: Upon City Clerk’s receipt of the resolution described in subparagraph (4) (c), the Council, at its next regular meeting following the date of said receipt, may, by motion, reverse or modify in whole or in part the Commission’s resolution. Unless the Commission’s resolution is reverted, it shall become effective with any Council modifications on the date following the Council meeting at which the resolution was considered.

18.42.06 Administration of Similar Use Classification.
The record of the Similar Use Classification proceeding shall be kept on file in the Office of the Planning Director. Within one year of the effective date of the classification, the Planning Commission shall initiate an appropriate amendment to this zoning Ordinance, as provided in Chapter 18.47 (Amendments and Zone Changes).

18.42.08 Revocation and Expiration of Similar Use Classification.
The provisions of Chapter 18.46 (Revocation and Expiration of Permits and Variances) shall apply. (Ord. 501, Sec. 3, 1983)

(9)    No permit or variance granted by the Commission hereunder, as provided in City’s zoning ordinances, shall become effective until 10 days after the date of the resolution granting said permit or variance, or until the effective date thereof as provided in said permit or variance, provided that the latter date is more than 10 days after the effective date of said resolution.

18.44.02 Intent and Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to allow variation from the strict application of the terms of this ordinance whereby reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of this ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic or other condition of such piece of property or improvement thereon, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this ordinance would involve practical difficulties or would be undue hardship unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this ordinance.

18.44.04 Limitations on the Variance.
(1)    A variance shall not be granted for a parcel of property which authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulation governing the parcel of property.

(2)    No variance shall be granted which would have the effect of granting a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property, which is the subject of the application, is situated.

18.44.06 Initiation.
A variance consistent with the purpose of this action may be initiated as follows:

(1)    By motion of either the City Council or Planning Commission.

(2)    By verified application of the owner or owners (or their authorized agents) of the property to which the variance is to apply.

Application for a variance shall be made to the Planning Commission on a form provided by the Planning Department, and shall be accompanied by the following:

(1)    The name and address of the applicant therefore; evidence that he is the owner of the parcel or premises involved, or that he has permission of the owner to make such application; and a legal description of the subject parcel or premises.

(2)    An application fee to assist in defraying the expense of postage, posting, advertising, and other costs of labor and materials incidental to the proceedings prescribed herein. This fee shall be in accord with a schedule established by resolution of the City Council and shall be non-refundable.

(3)    Nine copies of a Site Plan, containing all the information required by Section 18.40.08 (CONTENT OF A SITE PLAN).

(4)    Such other information as the Planning Commission or City Council may require, including but not limited to market studies, design studies, engineering studies, and evidence of the ability and intention of the applicant to proceed with construction in accordance with approved plans within one year from the approval of the variance.

(5)    Responsibility for Accuracy. The applicant shall be solely responsible for the accuracy of information submitted as part of his application. Submission of inaccurate plans, legal descriptions, surrounding property owners list, or other information shall be cause for invalidation of all actions regarding his petition.

(6)    Such applications shall be numbered consecutively in the order of their filing and shall become a part of the permanent official records of the City, and there shall be attached to each such application copies of all reports, notices and actions pertaining thereto.

18.44.10 Investigation of Application for Variance.
The Commission shall cause to be made such investigation of facts bearing on the application for variance as will provide necessary information to assure that the action on each such application is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.

18.44.14 Public Hearings on Application for Variance.
Public hearings and appeals on the Variance Application shall be held and governed by the provisions of Chapter 18.43 (HEARINGS AND APPEALS THEREFROM).

18.44.16 Criteria for Granting a Variance.
Neither the Commission nor the Council may grant a Variance from the terms and provisions of the City’s Zoning regulations as stated in Title 18 of the Municipal Code of the City, including any requirement provided therein, unless, it has first found from the evidence admitted during the Hearing before the Commission or Council that because of special circumstances, applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application and provisions of the terms of the City’s Zoning Regulations, from which the Variance is being sought, deprives the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zone classification.

At the time of granting any Variance, the Commission or Council shall impose thereon such conditions as will assure that the adjustment authorized by said Variance shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which subject property is located and further assure that the Variance shall not adversely affect property and the use thereof in the vicinity of subject property and the public health, safety and general welfare. (Ord. 312, Sec. 1, 1974)

18.44.18 Conditions of Approval.
The Commission in granting a Variance may establish conditions under which a lot or parcel of land may be used or a building erected and/or altered, or make requirements as to right-of-way dedications, architecture, height of building, open spaces, parking areas, and conditions of operation of any enterprise, or make any requirements that the Commission may consider necessary to prevent damage or prejudice to adjacent properties, or detriment to the welfare of the community.

18.44.20 Force of Conditions of Approval.
Any restrictions or conditions required by the Commission or the City Council on appeal, in the granting of a Variance under the provisions of this chapter shall be complied with. If such conditions or requirements are not met or if the use permitted is discontinued for a period of one year or more, the Commission shall hold a public hearing in the same manner as set forth in Chapter 18.46 (Revocation and Expiration of Permit and Variances) to determine if the permit should be revoked. Upon revocation, further use of the property, or maintenance of any building constructed thereon, by authority of such variance or permit shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. (Ord. 502, Sec. 4, 1983)

18.44.22 Administration of Variance.
(1)    All acts of the City Planning Commission under this section shall be construed as administrative acts performed for the purpose assuring that the intent and purpose of this ordinance shall apply in special cases, as provided in this section, and shall not be construed as amendments to the provisions of this ordinance or map.

(2)    The Site Plan submitted with an application, together with the conditions, if any, required by the Planning Commission and/or Council, shall be kept on file in the office of the Planning Director and shall be referred to prior to issuing a building permit. Where there is a substantial change from the original Site Plan, said action shall be referred to the Planning Commission for action, under the procedures of Chapter 18.40 (Site Plan Review). No modification to the conditions of the original resolution granting the Conditional Use Permit shall be permitted without a public hearing as required in Chapter 18.43 (Hearings and Appeals Therefrom). In case of such hearing, a new application, filing fee and procedure shall be required.

18.44.26 Reapplication for Variance.
The City shall not accept for filing nor consider any application for a variance on premises or in a building or structure, for which a similar variance application was denied by the City, irrespective of whom the applicants are on either application, until twelve consecutive calendar months have expired from the date of the final decision of the City denying the earlier application, unless such final decision was a denial with the grant of the privilege that a similar application may be filed sooner than twelve consecutive months from the date of said decision.

18.44.28 Revocation and Expiration of Variance.
The provisions of Chapter 18.46 (Revocation and Expiration of Permits and Variances) shall apply. (Ord. 501, Sec. 5, 1983)

The Planning Commission may, or if so directed by the City Council, shall prepare specific plans based on the general plan and drafts of such regulations, programs, and legislation as may in its judgment be required for the systematic execution of the general plan, and the Planning Commission may recommend such plans and measures to the City Council for adoption. Furthermore, any property owner(s), or a designated representative of the property owner(s), may by written notice to the City Council, request that the City prepare a Specific Plan. Said written notice shall be filed with the City Clerk for transmittal to the City Council. The City Clerk shall forward said written notice to the City Council not fewer than ten calendar days and no more than 45 calendar days after receipt.

18.52.12 Transfer of Density.
The size and distribution of lots within a subdivision of land shall be in compliance with the General Plan and adopted Specific Plan.

18.53.02 Purpose and Intent

The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations regarding the location and design of wireless communications facilities. This chapter is intended to ensure that the installation of wireless communication facilities will not be detrimental to the city’s public health, safety or welfare and to establish standards, timelines, and criteria, in accordance with applicable State and Federal regulations, including, without limitation, to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C., Sections 151 et seq., for the orderly development and siting of wireless communication facilities in the city; Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012; applicable state laws; and administrative and court decisions and determinations relating to the same. It is the intent of the chapter to treat wireless communications facilities, including antennas, in the same way that other mechanical equipment (e.g., air conditioners) are treated, and to require screening and architectural compatibility. (Ord. 1038 Sec. 3, 2018)

18.57.020 Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply in this chapter:

“Antenna” means any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiates or captures electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals or other communication signals.

“Associated equipment” means all on-site equipment, including, without limitation, back-up generators and power supply units, cabinets, coaxial and fiber optic cables, connections, shelters, radio transceivers, regular power supply units, and wiring, to which a wireless antenna is attached to facilitate mobile broadband service and personal wireless service delivered on mobile broadband devices.

“Base station” means a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined herein or any equipment located on a tower. Base station includes, without limitation:

(b)    Radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems (“DAS”) and small-cell networks).

(c)    Any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the city under this section, supports or houses equipment described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and has been previously reviewed and approved by the city.

“Collocation” means the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure to transmit and/or receive radio frequency signals for communications purposes which antennas are owned or operated by more than one public or private entity and includes the mounting or installation of additional wireless transmission equipment at an existing wireless facility.

“Data collection unit” or “DCU” means a wireless telecommunication facility comprised of a collection unit, a solar panel and whip antennas used for receiving and/or transmitting wireless signals from distributed gas and water data collector meters, which is a standalone facility not connected via fiber optic or other physical wiring to any other facility. No wireless telecommunications facility operated by an electric corporation, a telephone corporation, a personal wireless service provider, a commercial mobile service provider or a mobile telephone service provider shall be considered a DCU.

Size: Solar panels not larger than seven square feet, whip antennas not longer than 40 inches, and collections units not larger than 1.5 cubic feet. DCUs shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment and minimize the visual appearance by matching the color of the poles or buildings where the DCU is located.

“Distributed antenna system” or “DAS” means a network of one or more antennas and related fiber optic nodes typically mounted to or located at streetlight poles, utility poles, sporting venues, arenas or convention centers which provide access and signal transfer for wireless service providers. A distributed antenna system also includes the equipment location, sometimes called a “hub” or “hotel” where the DAS network is interconnected with one or more wireless service providers’ facilities to provide the signal transfer services.

“Eligible facilities request” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as “any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (i) collocation of new transmission equipment; (ii) removal of transmission equipment; or (iii) replacement of transmission equipment.”

“Eligible support structure” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as “any tower or base station as defined in this section, provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section.”

“Existing” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the FCC’s Section 6409(a) regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

“FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission or successor agency.

“Micro wireless facility” means a small cell that is no larger than 24 inches long, 15 inches in width, 12 inches in height, and that has an exterior antenna, if any, no longer than 11 inches.

“Public right-of-way” means the area across, along, beneath, in, on, over, under, upon and within the dedicated public streets, roads, sidewalks, trails, alleys, and waterways within the City, as they now exist or hereafter will exist, including unimproved areas that have been dedicated for public street purposes.

“Stealth” means any wireless telecommunications facility that is architecturally integrated into a building or other concealing structure, such that no portion of any antenna, antenna equipment, or any other apparatus associated with the function of the facility is visible. The concealing structure shall have an aesthetically pleasing architectural design which fits into the context of its surroundings.

“Substantial change” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location. For clarity, the definition in this chapter organizes the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location.

(a)    For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:

(1)    The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10 percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater);

(2)    The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater);

(3)    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or

(4)    The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

(b)    For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

(1)    The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10 percent or 10 feet (whichever is greater);

(2)    The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station;

(3)    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets;

(4)    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are 10 percent larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

(5)    The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

(c)    In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

(1)    The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the Planning/Building Director.

(2)    The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval; provided however, that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

Note: The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

“Tower” means any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any FCC-licensed or FCC-authorized antenna, including any structure constructed for wireless communications service. This term does not include a base station.

“Transmission equipment” means equipment that facilitates transmission of any FCC-licensed or FCC-authorized wireless communication service.

“Vertical infrastructure” means all poles or similar facilities owned or “controlled” by the city that are in the public rights-of-way or public utility easements and meant for, or used in whole or in part for, communications service, electric service, lighting, traffic control, or similar functions.

(a)    For purposes of this definition, the term “controlled” means having the right to allow subleases or sublicensing.

“Wireless telecommunication(s) facilities,” “wireless communication(s) facility,” “wireless facility,” or “facility” means any device or system for transmitting and/or receiving electromagnetic signals, including, but not limited to, radio waves and microwaves for cellular technology, personal communication services, mobile services, paging systems and related technologies. Facilities include towers, freestanding facilities, ground-mounted facilities, rooftop facilities, utility poles, transmitters, microwave dishes, antennas and parabolic antennas, small cells, macro- and microcells, DAS, DCU, all other types of equipment used in transmitting or receiving signals, antenna structures, associated buildings, base stations, emergency power systems or cabinets which house support equipment, and other accessory development.

Exclusions: The term “wireless telecommunications facility” does not apply to the following:

(a)    Government owned and operated telecommunications facilities.

(b)    Emergency medical care provider-owned and operated telecommunications facilities.

(c)    Mobile services providing public information coverage of news events of a temporary nature.

(d)    Any wireless telecommunications facilities exempted from this code by Federal law or State law. (Ord. 1038 Sec. 3, 2018)

18.61.60    Establishment of a Commercial Transition Overlay Zone

18.61.10 Intent and Purpose
The Commercial Transition Overlay (CTO) Zone is hereby created to allow for the transition of existing zoned properties into a C-G (Commercial General) zone.

A CTO zone will be used in combination with base districts/zoning regulations and will NOT change the underlying zoning category, i.e., all permitted uses remain the same. A CTO zone is superimposed over the established zone and establishes additional regulations.

The intent of the CTO zone is to encourage future commercial development of designated sites while providing the existing uses in the underlying zone the right to maintain their underlying zoning, continue the use, expand, improve, and alter or move buildings on their property, but with limitations. The purpose of the CTO zone is to protect the existing uses, while encouraging commercial development. (Ord. 856; 2006)

18.61.20 Applicability and Regulations
The following regulations and general rules set forth in this Chapter 18.47 (AMENDMENTS AND ZONE CHANGES) shall apply to a CTO zone. Where a conflict in regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this Chapter shall apply. When this overlay zone is applied by the zone change process, the area so zoned shall have “CTO” in parenthesis added as a suffix to its base zone. In addition, each CTO shall be consecutively numbered on the official zoning map. For example: M-1 (CTO-1) or A-1-20 (CTO-2). Consecutively numbering the CTO zones will provide a distinction among CTO areas in the City.

18.61.30 Uses Permitted
All uses permitted and conditionally permitted in the underlying zone shall be permitted and conditionally permitted, respectively, pursuant to the regulations set forth in this chapter.

18.61.40 Development Standards
All development standards in underlying zone shall apply.

18.61.50 Limitations
The following restrictions shall be applicable to uses and development in the CTO zone:

(1)    Expansions or alterations of existing uses or structures, when a CTO zone is applied, shall not exceed 25 percent of the existing floor area, with expansions and alterations requiring review and approval of a site plan by the Planning Commission. In the event expansions and alterations are done in phases and/or over the life of the uses allowed in the underlying zone, the cumulative result of those expansions and alterations shall not exceed 25 percent of the existing floor area;

(2)    If uses or structures on properties designated with a CTO zone are involuntarily destroyed to any extent, including total destruction, they may be rebuilt to the identical use and original floor area;

(3)    Change of property ownership for those properties with a CTO zone shall not require a zone change to a C-G zone. However, if all permitted or conditionally permitted uses of the underlying zone on a property are discontinued for a period of 120 days or more, the City shall process a zone change to change the underlying zoning designation on a subject property to C-G, and the overlying zone shall no longer apply; and

(4)    Voluntary termination of an entire use and demolition of all structures on a property where a CTO zone is applied shall require that the City process a zone change on a subject property from the underlying zone to a C-G zone before re-development on the subject property is allowed.

18.61.60 Establishment of a Commercial Transition Overlay Zone
A CTO zone may be established upon motion of the Planning Commission, City Council, or at the request of property owner or owners in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 18.47 (ZONE CHANGES).

18.64.02 Intent and Purpose.
The housing development overlay (HDO) zone is intended to facilitate and encourage the development of affordable housing consistent with the requirements of State Government Code Article 10.6 (65580) and the Norco General Plan Housing Element. The HDO zone will apply to specific properties within the City as shown on the official City of Norco zoning map and will require a HDO site plan to guide development on each site. The HDO zone is intended to facilitate the development of affordable housing within a mixed-use context while taking into account the community’s small plot agricultural/animal-keeping/equestrian lifestyle. (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.04 Applicability.
The regulations and general rules set forth in Chapter 18.47 (Amendments and Zone Changes) shall apply to the HDO zone. The regulations provide for a review of the proposed uses and the comprehensive development plans on existing lots. When the HDO zone is applied to a property through the zone change process, the property so zoned shall be so named and consecutively numbered with the underlying zone in parenthesis added as a suffix on the official zoning map. For example: HDO-1 (C-G) would be the first HDO zone with an underlying zoning of commercial general (C-G).

Where a conflict occurs between the requirements of this chapter and other City requirements, this chapter shall apply. Any proposed project including, but not limited to, the division of land, site plan or any grading wholly or partially within a HDO zone shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.06 Establishment of an HDO Zone.
A HDO zone may be initiated upon motion by the Planning Commission, City Council, or at the request of the property owner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 18.47 (Amendments and Zone Changes). (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.08 Uses.
Upon approval of an HDO site plan, the following category of uses may be permitted:

A.    Residential Development.

1.    Residential development may include the development of single-family homes, multifamily homes, condominiums, townhomes, courtyard housing and other similar forms of housing and shall be developed at a density of 20 to 30 dwelling units per acre.

2.    At least 50 percent of the City’s lower income regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) must be accommodated on land designated exclusively for residential uses. To meet this State requirement, at least 50 percent of the acreage identified within an HDO site plan area must be used for exclusively residential uses at a density of 20 to 30 dwelling units per acre.

3.    Residential development up to a maximum 35 dwelling units per acre may be permitted if a density bonus is awarded as described in Section 18.64.10.

4.    Residential development may include supportive and transitional housing as defined in Chapter 18.02 and single-resident occupancy units as defined in Chapter 18.02 and regulated by Section 18.66.06.

B.    Nonhousing Development.

1.    After the City’s lower income regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) requirement has been met per requirements of Section 18.64.08(A)(2), any remaining acreage may be identified for the development of mixed-use, additional residential uses, and/or nonresidential uses as permitted by the underlying zone.

When the HDO zone is applied to a property, mixed-use development is permitted and residential development at 20 to 30 dwelling units per acre is required on acres specified in the HDO site plan. All parcels approved as a HDO zone must meet the requirements for residential development before nonresidential uses, as permitted in the underlying zoning, are allowed. City staff reserves the right to review all nonresidential uses for compatibility with the required residential densities and uses as part of the site plan review process.

If a project is proposed to be developed in phases, the required residential development must be developed prior to proposed mixed use and/or nonresidential development. (Ord. 969 Sec. 1, 2014; Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.10 Density Bonus.
To encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing, a density bonus may be awarded to projects that provide equestrian facilities in conjunction with development of a HDO zone. If an applicant chooses to provide such facilities, a density bonus allowing residential development of up to a maximum 35 dwelling units per acre may be awarded. A proposed density bonus will be evaluated by the Planning Commission as part of the HDO site plan review process.

The intent of the density bonus is to expand the animal-keeping lifestyle to all economic segments of the regional population. The inclusion of equestrian facilities will help preserve and maintain the equestrian character and rural nature of the City while accommodating the affordable housing needs of the community. (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.12 Existing Development.
Legal uses, lots, and structures existing prior to the adoption of the HDO zone for a property in question which are not consistent with the standards and requirements of the HDO zone shall be deemed nonconforming and subject to the provisions of Chapter 18.39 (General Provisions—Non-Conforming Uses, Lots, and Structures). (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

18.64.14 HDO Site Plan Requirement.
Any development in an HDO zone shall be subject to approval of an HDO site plan numbered consistently with the HDO zone and subject to the same review process as a site plan per Chapter 18.40 (Site Plan Review). To assure that the requirements of this chapter are properly met and HDO zoned properties are comprehensively planned and affordable housing encouraged, a HDO site plan must be in effect prior to the approval of any subdivision of land, any grading of property that would require a grading permit, and any construction that would require a building permit, excepting therefrom any work done by the City or other public agency for the protection of public health, safety, or general welfare.

Consistent with Chapter 18.40 (Site Plan Review) an HDO site plan submittal shall depict and contain, but is not limited to, the following:

A.    Lot Dimensions.

B.    All existing and proposed buildings and structures, including their location, size, height, proposed use, design and construction material.

C.    All existing and proposed yards and spaces between buildings and structures.

D.    All existing and proposed walls, fences and landscaping including the location, height, area, nature and type of design and material composition for the walls and fences and the type landscaping vegetation and irrigation system proposed for such.

E.    All existing and proposed off-street parking, including the location, number of parking spaces, dimensions of the entire parking area and individual parking spaces, the arrangement of spaces, internal circulation pattern for pedestrian, equestrian, and vehicular traffic, and the landscaping thereof.

F.    All existing and proposed access to the lot, including pedestrian, equestrian, and vehicular access; the points of ingress and egress to the lot, the width, location and description of the access areas and of the streets from which access and ingress is proposed.

G.    All existing and proposed loading, including the location, area dimensions, number of loading spaces and the internal vehicular traffic circulation on the site for loading vehicles.

H.    All existing and proposed lighting, including the location and general nature of both offsite and onsite lighting; the proposed intensity thereof and diffusion thereof.

J.    All existing and proposed outdoor and indoor storage activities, including but not limited to the nature of such storage, its location, proposed height and type of screening for such including the design and material composition thereof.

K.    All existing and proposed drainage and grading onsite and offsite, including the location of the drains, their type and dimensions.

L.    A land use plan is required to illustrate the proposed location of uses on each HDO site and must specifically demonstrate where the required residential uses will be located on the site, the proposed densities, housing product types, and the relationship to the other uses on the site.

M.    A detailed list with descriptions of individual uses permitted or conditionally permitted within the proposed HDO zone. When a use is not permitted by the underlying zone, including residential and/or mixed uses, development and design standards must be provided by the applicant. Proposed standards for residential and mixed uses should facilitate the development of housing to meet the required densities and to encourage a variety of housing types.

N.    Elevations and illustrative drawings of the proposed development.

O.    If applicable, a phasing plan must be submitted showing how project development will occur.

P.    Such other data as may be required by the Planning Director to enable the Planning Commission to make a proper review and take action thereon. (Ord. 967 Sec. 1, 2013; Ord. 947 Sec. 1, 2012)

(b)    The land must be transferred no later than the date of the approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or housing development application; and

(c)    The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred must be sufficient to permit construction of dwelling units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than 10 percent of the total number of market rate dwelling units in the proposed development (i.e., the proposed development before the addition of any density bonus); and

(d)    The donated land is at least one acre in size or is large enough to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate general plan land use designation, has the appropriate zoning and development standards for affordable housing and, at the time of project approval is, or at the time of construction will be, served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure; and

(e)    No later than the date of approval of the final map, parcel map, or other development application for the housing development, the donated land must have all of the applicable permits and approvals (other than building permits) necessary for the development of the very low income housing units on the donated land, except that the City may subject the proposed housing development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by California Government Code Section 65583.2(i) if the design is not reviewed by the City prior to the time of transfer; and

(f)    The donated land is subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the very low income units consistent with Section 18.65.06(4), which deed restriction shall be recorded upon the donated property at the time of its transfer; and

(g)    The land will be transferred to the City or to a housing developer approved by the City. The City reserves the right to require the applicant to identify a developer and to require that the land be transferred to that developer; and

(h)    The land is within the boundary of the proposed housing development or within one-fourth mile of the boundary of the proposed housing development; and

(i)    No later than the date of approval of the final map, parcel map, or other development application for the housing development, a proposed source of funding for the construction of the very low income units shall be identified.

(3)    Additional Density Bonus Based on Greater Suitability of Land for Very Low Income Housing. For each one percent increase above the minimum 10 percent in the number of very low income housing units that can be accommodated on the donated land, the maximum density bonus shall be increased by one percent, up to a maximum of 35 percent, as follows:

18.65.10 General Provisions Governing Density Bonus Calculations.
(1)    For the purposes of any provisions in this chapter, an applicant may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus than that to which the housing development is eligible.

(2)    When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next larger whole number.

(3)    For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the dwelling units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the affordable units are located.

(4)    For the purposes of this chapter, the “total units” or “total dwelling units” in a housing development does not include those units added by any density bonus.

(5)    Regardless of the number or extent of affordable units, senior housing, land dedication, or other qualifications for a density bonus provided in any single housing development, no housing development may be entitled to a total density bonus of more than 35 percent.

18.65.12 Incentives and Concessions for Affordable Housing.
(1)    Definition of a Qualified Incentive or Concession. A qualifying project shall be entitled to at least one but no more than three of the following incentives identified by state law:

(a)    A reduction in the parcel development standards (e.g., coverage, setback, zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes, architectural design requirements and/or parking requirements). Development standard means any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation. In no case may the City apply a development standard that will have the effect of precluding the construction of affordable units. A waiver or modification to development standards may be requested by the applicant, and shall be approved unless such waiver or modification creates an adverse impact as described in subsection (3) of this section.

(b)    Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing project, and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing project and existing or planned development in the area where the proposed development will be located.

(c)    Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City that will result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions.

(2)    Number of Incentives or Concessions. The number of incentives shall be based on the percentage of affordable units in the project:

(a)    One incentive or concession shall be entitled for projects where at least five percent of the total units are for very low income households, 10 percent of the total units are for lower income households, or 10 percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households.

(b)    Two incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least 10 percent of the total units are for very low income households, 20 percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least 20 percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households.

(c)    Three incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least 15 percent of the total units are for very low income households, 30 percent of the total units are for lower income households, or 30 percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households.

Notes:

1.    An incentive or concession may be requested only if an application is also made for a density bonus.

2.    Incentives or concessions may be selected from only one category (very low, lower, or moderate).

3.    No incentives or concessions are available for land donation.

(3)    Findings to Deny Incentive or Concession. The City shall grant the incentive or concession requested by the applicant unless the City makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of any of the following:

(a)    The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for affordable rents for the restricted units; or

(b)    The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. A specific adverse impact means a significant, unavoidable impact, as provided in written standards, policies, or conditions; or

(c)    The incentive or concession would be contrary to state or federal law.

(4)    Exceptions. This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the City or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. Nor does any provision of this section require the City to grant an incentive or concession found to have a specific adverse impact.

(5)    Amendment, Zone Change. The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.14 Waivers and Modifications of Development Standards.
(1)    Applicants granted a density bonus pursuant to Section 18.65.06 may, by written proposal, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this chapter. The applicant may also request a meeting with the City to discuss such request for waiver and modifications.

(2)    In order to obtain a waiver or modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 18.65.06, at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter.

(3)    A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to Section 18.65.12.

(4)    The City may deny a request for any waiver, modification or reduction of development standards if the waiver, modification or reduction would have a specific adverse impact. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.16 Parking Incentives.
Upon the written request of the applicant for a housing development meeting the criteria for a density bonus under Section 18.65.06, the City shall not require a vehicular parking ratio that exceeds the following:

(1)    Zero to one bedroom units: One on-site parking space.

(2)    Two to three bedroom units: Two on-site parking spaces.

(3)    Four and more bedroom units: Two and one-half parking spaces.

Guest parking and handicapped parking shall be included within the maximum number of spaces that may be required. If the total number of parking spaces required for a housing development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a housing development may provide on-site parking through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking. For purposes of this chapter, the parking ratios set forth in this section shall be deemed a concession or incentive available to the applicant under Section 18.65.12. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.18 Standards for Density Bonus Housing Developments.
(1)    Affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the housing development and compatible with the design of market rate units in terms of appearance, materials, and finished quality. The applicant may reduce the interior amenities and square footage of inclusionary units, provided all units conform to all other requirements of this municipal code.

(2)    For developments with multiple market rate units containing differing numbers of bedrooms, affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be representative of the market rate unit mix.

(3)    All building permits for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be issued concurrently with, or prior to, issuance of building permits for the market rate units, and the affordable units shall be constructed concurrently with, or prior to, construction of the market rate units. Occupancy permits and final inspections for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be approved concurrently with, or prior to, approval of occupancy permits and final inspections for the market rate units. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.20 Application Requirements.
(1)    An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this section shall be submitted with the first approval of the housing development and processed concurrently with all other applications required for the housing development.

(2)    For affordable units qualifying the housing development for a density bonus, the application shall include the following information:

(a)    A site plan identifying the base project without the density bonus, number and location of all inclusionary units, affordable units qualifying for the project for a density bonus, and proposed density bonus units; and

(b)    Proposed category(ies) qualifying the housing development for a density bonus; and

(c)    Level of affordability of all affordable and inclusionary units and proposals for ensuring affordability, if applicable; and

(d)    A description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards.

(e)    If a density bonus or concession is requested for a land donation, the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that each of the findings included in Section 18.65.08 can be made.

(3)    Upon submission of the application to the City, the Planning Director or designee shall determine if the application is complete and conforms to the provisions of this chapter. No application for a first approval for a housing development requesting a density bonus, incentives, concessions, or waivers may be deemed complete unless an affordable housing plan is submitted conforming to the provisions of this chapter.

(4)    A request for a minor modification of an approved application may be granted by the City Manager or designee if the modification is substantially in compliance with the original application and the conditions of approval. Other modifications to the affordable housing plan shall be processed in the same manner as the original application. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.22 Application Review.
(1)    An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this chapter shall be reviewed as part of the first approval of the housing development by the approval body with authority to approve the housing development, unless additional review by the planning commission or City Council is required. An applicant proposing a housing development pursuant to this chapter may submit a preliminary application prior to the submittal of any formal request for approval of a housing development.

(2)    Within 90 days of receipt of the preliminary application the City shall provide to an applicant a letter which identifies project issues of concern (the maximum financial assistance that the Planning Director can support when making a recommendation to the City Council), and the procedures for compliance with this chapter. The Planning Director shall inform the applicant that the requested additional incentives shall be recommended for consideration with the proposed housing development, or that alternative or modified additional incentives pursuant to Section 18.65.12 shall be recommended for consideration in lieu of the requested incentives. If alternative or modified incentives are recommended by the Planning Director, the recommendation shall establish how the alternative or modified incentives can be expected to have an equivalent affordability effect as the requested incentives.

(3)    Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or modification, the approval body shall make the following findings:

(a)    The housing development is: (i) eligible for a density bonus, and/or (ii) any concessions, incentives, waivers, modifications, or reduced parking standards requested conform to all requirements of this chapter, and (iii) supported by a financing mechanism for all implementation and monitoring costs.

(b)    If the density bonus is based all or in part on dedication of land, the application meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 18.65.08.

(c)    If a waiver or modification is requested, the applicant has shown that the waiver, modification or reduction of development standards meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 18.65.14.

(4)    If the findings stated in subsection (3) of this section can be made, and a request for an incentive or concession is otherwise consistent with this chapter, the approval body may deny a concession or incentive based upon written findings of any of the factors stated in Section 18.65.12 for the denial or disqualification of a concession or incentive.

(5)    If the required findings stated in subsection (3) of this section can be made, and a request for a waiver or modification is otherwise consistent with this chapter, the approval body may deny the requested waiver or modification based upon written findings of any of the factors stated in Section 18.65.14 for the denial or disqualification of a waiver or modification.

(6)    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to grant an incentive or concession or to waive or reduce development standards if that incentive, concession, waiver, or reduction has a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.

(7)    Any decision regarding a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 4.04. In accordance with state law, neither the granting of a concession or incentive, nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.65.24 Developer Affordable Housing Agreement.
(1)    Applications requesting a density bonus shall agree to enter into a density bonus housing agreement with the City. The terms of the draft agreement shall be reviewed and revised as appropriate by the Planning Director, who shall formulate a recommendation to the planning commission for final approval. A density bonus housing agreement shall be made a condition of the discretionary planning permits for all housing developments pursuant to this chapter and shall be recorded as a restriction on any parcels on which the affordable units or density bonus units will be constructed.

(2)    The density bonus housing agreement shall be recorded prior to final or parcel map approval, or, where the housing development does not include a map, prior to issuance of a building permit for any structure in the housing development. The density bonus housing agreement shall run with the land and bind future owners and successors in interest. (Ord. 965 Sec. 1, 2013)

18.68.02 Intent and Purpose.
It is hereby found and declared that the City of Norco lies in a natural setting of rural, scenic and historical beauty; that this rural environment generates a strong characteristic for development of Norco as a new equestrian focal point in Southern California; that this unique rural environment and historically significant location contribute a material economic advantage to the citizens, business, and industry within the City and particularly to the property owners who reside therein; and that development in an orderly manner with compatible uses and appearances of structures within and between zones and with the natural rural environment is necessary to maintain such historic and economic advantage, to stabilize, protect, and maintain property values, and to encourage permanence of desirable residential areas.

The purpose of the accessory building use permit is to review the location, architectural design, and/or conduct of certain land uses associated with accessory buildings in residential and agricultural zones. Accessory buildings and their associated uses can have a unique and distinct impact on the area and surrounding properties in which they are located, and thus require special review and conditions as needed. An accessory building use permit may be granted at the discretion of the Planning Commission, or City Council on appeal, whichever is the approving body, and is not the automatic right of any applicant.

Accessory buildings that are 240 square feet or smaller and not higher than 14 feet are exempt from having to be reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 1030 Sec. 1, 2018; Ord. 1019 Sec. 1, 2017)

(2)    An application fee to assist in defraying the expense of postage, posting, advertising, and other costs of labor and materials incidental to the proceedings prescribed herein.

(5)    Responsibility for Accuracy. The applicant shall be solely responsible for the accuracy of information submitted as part of their application. Submission of inaccurate plans, legal descriptions, application requirements, and other information may be cause for invalidation of all actions regarding this petition.

(6)    Such applications shall be numbered consecutively in the order of their filing and shall become a part of the permanent official records of the City, and there shall be attached to each such application copies of all reports, notices and actions pertaining thereto.

Amendments to this Chapter shall not affect any Franchise Agreement entered into prior to the effective date of the amendment, unless both parties to the Franchise Agreement also amend the Agreement to incorporate the provisions of the amended Chapter. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and Grantee’s Franchise Application, the provisions of the Agreement shall govern.

(a)    Assess against the Grantee monetary damages up to the limits established in the franchise agreement for material franchise violations, which the Grantee hereby agrees to pay, said assessment to be levied against the security fund, hereinabove provided, and collected by Grantor immediately upon said assessment Grantor and Grantee agree that the amount of such assessment shall be deemed, without proof, to represent liquidation of damages actually sustained by Grantor by reason of Grantee’s failure to perform. Such assessment shall not constitute a waiver by the Grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or under applicable law (except that such liquidated amounts shall be the sole amounts recoverable), by Grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise. This provision for assessment of damages is intended by the parties to be separate and apart from Grantor’s right to enforce the provisions of the construction and performance bonds provided for in Section 19.04.060, and is intended to substitute for compensation to Grantor for actual damages.

(b)    For violations considered by Grantor to have materially degraded the quality of service, order and direct Grantee to issue rebates or reduce its rates and/or charges to subscribers, in an amount solely determined by Grantor to provide monetary relief substantially equal to the reduced quality of service resulting from Grantee’s failure to perform.

(c)    Require grantee to cure all defaults and breaches of its obligations hereunder before Grantee is entitled to increase any rate or charge to subscribers hereunder.

(d)    Terminate the franchise, for any of the causes stated in Section 19.04.040, above.

In the event that the Grantor determines that the Grantee has violated any provisions of the franchise, any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant hereto or any applicable federal, state, or local law, the Grantor may make a written demand on the Grantee that it remedy such violation. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the satisfaction of the Grantor within thirty (30) days following such demand, the Grantor shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by the Grantee was excusable or inexcusable, in accordance with the following procedure: (Ord. 498, Sec. 12, 1983)

(a)    A public hearing shall be held and the Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Grantee of the time and the place of the hearing provided and the allegations of franchise violations.

(b)    If, after notice is given and at the Grantee’s option a full public proceeding is held, the Grantor determines that such violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by the Grantee was excusable as provided in Section (3) below, the Grantor shall direct the Grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Grantor may direct.

(c)    If, after notice is given and, at the Grantee’s option, a full public proceeding is held, the Grantor determines that such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect was inexcusable, then the Grantor may assess a penalty or remedy in accordance with Section (1) above.

(3)    Force Majeure; Grantee’s Inability to Perform. In the event Grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of the franchise is prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided Grantee has notified Grantor in writing within thirty (30) days or other reasonable amount of time, of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event.

Any exterior alteration that would require a certificate of appropriateness for a landmark shall require a certificate of appropriateness for a point of historical interest; however, the review process shall be conducted solely by the Cultural Resources Administrator and any resulting recommendations shall be nonbinding. All recommendations and decisions regarding certificates of appropriateness shall be made with the advice and counsel of a professional who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Qualifications. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.020 Certificate of appropriateness.
A.    No demolition permit shall be granted for any structure 50 years old or older until it has been evaluated and determined eligible or not eligible for designation as a landmark by a professional meeting the Secretary of Interior Qualifications for such determinations. Should the structure be determined eligible for designation as a landmark, a certificate of appropriateness shall be processed in accordance with this title. Costs, if any, for such evaluation shall be borne by the property owner.

B.    No person, owner or other entity shall restore, rehabilitate, alter, develop, construct, demolish, remove or change the appearance of any landmark or point of historical interest without first having applied for and been granted a certificate of appropriateness by the City Council upon recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission, or an administrative certificate of appropriateness by the Cultural Resources Administrator, or by the City Council on appeal.

C.    Notwithstanding the language in the above subsection, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the construction, alteration, repair, restoration, stabilization or demolition of a landmark or point of historical interest if the Building Official has determined the cultural resource creates an unsafe or dangerous condition that constitutes an imminent threat as defined in the California Building Code, and the proposed action is necessary to mitigate the unsafe or dangerous condition. In such event no certificate of appropriateness shall be required. However, the Building Official shall make all reasonable efforts to consult with the Cultural Resources Administrator or his/her designated representative to determine if there are feasible alternatives to the proposed action that will adequately protect the public health and safety.

D.    The following types of projects affecting a landmark may be reviewed and approved or conditionally approved for an administrative certificate of appropriateness by the Cultural Resources Administrator:

1.    The in-kind replacement of historically correct architectural features or building elements, including windows, doors, exterior siding, porches, cornices, balustrades, stairs, and the like, that are deteriorated, damaged beyond restoration, or missing.

2.    The in-kind replacement of historically correct site or landscape features that are deteriorated, damaged beyond restoration, or missing.

3.    The replacement or repair of roof covering materials.

4.    Fences and walls.

5.    Awnings and building mounted signs.

E.    All other projects affecting a landmark shall be subject to review and approval or conditional approval by the City Council upon recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission.

F.    Unless the interior of a landmark or contributing or noncontributing structure within a historic preservation overlay zone is specifically included in its designation, the provisions of this title shall apply only to exterior alterations and any interior alterations that would affect the exterior of a cultural resource.

G.    A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for the ordinary maintenance and repair of a landmark or point of historical interest.

H.     The requirements of this chapter are in addition to any and all other City permit requirements. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.030 Referral to the Historic Preservation Commission.
The Cultural Resources Administrator may refer an administrative certificate of appropriateness application to the Historic Preservation Commission when he/she believes the importance of the landmark or the discrepancies between the proposal and the findings and standards of this chapter would justify a more public review. Any such referral shall be made within 10 days of the acceptance of a complete application by the Cultural Resources Administrator and shall be placed on the next available Historic Preservation Commission agenda. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.040 Duty to maintain.
A.    All landmarks and points of historical interest shall be preserved against decay and deterioration, kept in a state of good repair, and free from structural defects. The purpose of this section is to prevent an owner or other person having legal custody and control over a property from facilitating demolition of a cultural resource by neglecting it and by permitting damage to it by weather and/or vandalism.

B.    Consistent with other State and City codes requiring that buildings and structures be kept in good repair, the owner or other person having legal custody and control of a landmark or point of historical interest shall repair such building or structure in accordance with the standards and procedures of this title if it is found to have any of the following defects:

1.    Building elements so attached that they may fall.

2.    Deteriorated or inadequate foundations.

3.    Deteriorated or inadequate flooring.

4.    Members of walls, partitions, or other vertical supports that split, lean, list, or buckle due to defective material or deterioration.

5.    Members of ceilings or roofs which sag, split, or buckle due to defective materials or deterioration.

6.    Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge, or settle due to defective material or deterioration.

8.    Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations, floors, windows or doors.

9.    Defective or lack of weather protection for exterior wall coverings, including lack of paint or other protective coverings.

10.    Any fault, defect, or deterioration in the building which renders it structurally unsafe or not properly watertight.

C.    If the Commission has reason to believe that a landmark or point of historical interest is being neglected and subject to damage from weather and/or vandalism, the City Council upon recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission may direct the Cultural Resources Administrator to meet with the owner or other person having legal custody and control of the cultural resource and to discuss with them the ways to improve the condition of the property. The Cultural Resources Administrator shall provide a written record to the owner or other person having legal custody and control of the cultural resource of the deficiencies noted, the remedies discussed, and a timeline for accomplishing the repairs. If insufficient effort is made to correct any noted conditions thereafter, the Commission with the concurrence of the City Council may, at a noticed public hearing, make a formal request that the City take action to require corrections of defects in the cultural resource in order that such cultural resource may be preserved in accordance with this title. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.050 Application of the State Historic Building Code.
Pursuant to the State of California Health and Safety Code, the Building Official shall apply the State Historic Building Code in permitting repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, moving, or continued use of a designated landmark. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.060 Application for certificate of appropriateness.
The certificate of appropriateness or administrative certificate of appropriateness application shall be made on forms provided by the Cultural Resources Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such fee as is required by resolution of the City Council. Applications shall include plans and specifications showing the design, materials, colors, landscaping, and irrigation relating to the proposed improvements. Where appropriate and required by the Cultural Resources Administrator, applications shall also show the relationship of the proposed work to the surrounding area. The Cultural Resources Administrator may require any additional information deemed necessary to make an informed judgment of the proposed work. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.070 Principles and standards of site development and design review.
A.    The Historic Preservation Commission, City Council, and/or Cultural Resources Administrator shall apply any adopted design guidelines and adhere to the following principles, which are based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, when reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness or administrative certificates or appropriateness:

1.    The anticipated use for the property remains that for which it was originally intended or requires minimal alteration for the proposed reuse.

2.    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a cultural resource and its environment shall not be compromised. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive features should be avoided when possible.

3.    All cultural resources shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to recreate an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.

4.    Certain alterations which may have taken place in the course of time are potentially significant to understanding the history and development of a cultural resource and its environment. If such historic alterations have acquired significance in their own right, this significance shall be recognized and respected.

5.    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a cultural resource shall be retained.

6.    Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair and replacement of missing features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different elements from other sources.

7.    Surface cleaning of cultural resources shall be undertaken with proven methods that will avoid damage to historic materials.

8.    Contemporary design for alterations and additions shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not compromise significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the cultural resource and its environs.

9.    Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to the cultural resource shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the resource would be unimpaired.

10.    Archaeological resources should be protected and preserved in place. If such resources will be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

11.    Any other Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties may also be applied as appropriate.

B.    The Historic Preservation Commission or Cultural Resources Administrator shall make the following findings, as applicable, in considering whether a certificate of appropriateness or administrative certificate of appropriateness should be granted or denied:

1.    The proposed project is consistent or compatible with the architectural period and the character-defining features of the historic building.

2.    The proposed project is compatible with existing adjacent or nearby cultural resources and their character-defining features.

3.    The colors, textures, materials, fenestration, decorative features, details, height, scale, massing, and methods of construction proposed are consistent with the period and/or compatible with adjacent cultural resources.

4.    The proposed change does not destroy or adversely affect an important architectural, historical, cultural or archaeological feature or features.

5.    Such other standards as are adopted by resolution of the City Council upon recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.080 Application processing time limits.
The application shall be considered and acted upon by the Historic Preservation Commission within 45 days for certificates of appropriateness or by the Cultural Resources Administrator within 21 days for administrative certificates of appropriateness. Such time periods shall be calculated from the date on which a complete application is accepted by the Cultural Resources Administrator. However, such time periods shall be extended when necessary to comply with the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or with the written concurrence of the applicant. A public hearing shall be scheduled and notice provided per this title and CEQA, when applicable. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.090 Decision authority.
When the application is for permission to restore, rehabilitate, alter, develop, construct or change the appearance of any landmark the City Council, upon recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission, the Cultural Resources Administrator, or the City Council on appeal may approve, grant conditional approval, or deny the application. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.100 Review of substantial adverse changes.
When the application is for an action that may cause a substantial adverse change to a landmark or point of historical interest, the application will be reviewed to determine if the proposed change would have a substantial adverse change to a cultural resource as defined by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). If it is determined that potentially substantial adverse changes to a cultural resource cannot be effectively mitigated to a level of insignificance, no approval of any work which may cause a substantial adverse change to a cultural resource may be granted unless:

A.    It is determined, pursuant to adopted City and State processes, that an immediate safety hazard exists and that demolition of the structure is the only feasible means to secure the public safety; or

B.    It is determined by the City Council through the CEQA process that, taking into account the value of all available incentives and costs of rehabilitation and adaptive reuse alternatives, the property retains no substantial remaining market value or reasonable use. Costs of alterations made in violation of this chapter and thus without the benefit of an approved certificate of appropriateness, or by failure to maintain the property required by this title, shall not be included in the calculation of rehabilitation costs. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)

20.30.110 Appeal.
Any person aggrieved or affected by a recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission or Cultural Resources Administrator to approve, conditionally approve or deny an application, or by the failure of the Commission to act within the required time limits may appeal to the City Council any time within 15 days after the date the Commission or Cultural Resources Administrator announces its decision or is required to announce its decision. An appeal shall be taken by filing a letter of appeal with the Cultural Resources Administrator and by concurrently paying to the City a fee in an amount established by City Council resolution. Such letter of appeal shall set forth the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Within 10 days after the receipt of the letter of appeal and the filing fee, the Cultural Resources Administrator shall transmit to the City Council the letter of appeal, copies of the application and all other papers constituting the record upon which the action was taken. The City Council may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the Cultural Resources Administrator or the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission. Such action by the City Council shall be final. (Ord. 910 Sec. 1, 2009)
