Article I. Code of Ethics

2.52.010 Code of Ethics.
As public employees we are entrusted with the confidence of those we serve to fulfill the responsibilities of our roles. Our actions are deemed representative of those we serve and our function, therefore, carries with it a greater responsibility than that of the private enterprise employee. Our system of government is viewed by the public through our acts as we fulfill the demands of our positions. We must demonstrate competency, integrity, honesty, courtesy and fairness in all relationships, private and public, to best represent the type of government desired by all. We have a patriotic duty to fulfill our roles in the highest standard possible for the purpose of assuring exemplary government for all people. A departure from this ideal creates an injustice for all. (Ord. 87-1 § 2, 1987).

Classes may consist of only one position.

C. “Class series” means two or more classes similar as to line of work and differing as to responsibility and difficulty, arranged in a ladder of steps in a normal line of promotion.

The supervisor will give an oral decision to the employee within five days subsequent to the discussion. If the immediate supervisor is the topic of the grievance and the employee believes face-to-face discussion of the grievance will serve no added value, the employee will tell the supervisor that the supervisor is the topic of the grievance and that the formal grievance procedure will be implemented.

B. Step 2 – Formal Grievance. If the employee is dissatisfied with the immediate supervisor’s oral decision, the grievance may be pursued by submitting it in writing on the City’s grievance form to the supervisor within five days of the decision given in Step 1. Failure to complete this procedure will bar further consideration of the grievance. The supervisor shall schedule a grievance conference at a mutually agreeable time, hear the grievance, and render a written decision to the employee within 10 days of receipt of the formal grievance. An employee representative may attend the grievance conference.

C. Step 3 – Departmental Appeal. If the employee wishes to appeal the supervisor’s written decision, a copy of the grievance and the supervisor’s response must be submitted on the City’s grievance form to the employee’s department manager within five days of receipt of the supervisor’s decision. If the employee is a department manager, proceed to Step 5. Failure to complete this procedure will bar further consideration of the grievance. The department manager shall schedule a grievance conference at a mutually agreeable time, hear the appeal, and render a written decision to the employee within 10 days of the grievance conference. An employee representative may attend the grievance conference.

D. Step 4 – Administrative Appeal. If the employee wishes to appeal the department manager’s written decision, the appeal must be submitted to the City Administrator within five days of receipt of the department manager’s decision. The written appeal must be made on the City’s grievance form and will include the original grievance and management responses, if any. Failure to complete this procedure will bar further consideration of the grievance. The City Administrator shall schedule a grievance conference at a mutually agreeable time, hear the appeal, and render a written decision to the employee within 10 days of the grievance conference. An employee representative may attend the grievance conference.

E. Step 5 – Department Manager’s Appeal. The City Administrator is the immediate supervisor for all department managers. If a department manager is a grievant and wishes to appeal the decision of the supervisor, the appeal shall be heard by a mutually agreed upon, independent hearing officer who shall be compensated by the City. Once selected, the independent hearing officer must receive the appeal within five days. The written appeal must be made on the City’s grievance form and will include the original grievance and supervisor response, if any. Failure to complete this procedure will bar further consideration of the grievance. The independent hearing officer shall schedule a grievance conference at a mutually agreeable time, hear the appeal, and render a written decision to the department manager within 10 days of the grievance conference.

A. When an emergency threatens the life, health or property of the community and requires that an order be placed immediately with the nearest available source of supply;

B. When the amount involved is less than $25,000;

C. When the supply, material, or equipment can be obtained from only one vendor or supplier;

D. When a professional service, such as that available from an attorney, accountant, architect or specialized consultant, involves a specialized knowledge or personal skill;

E. When supplies or equipment, such as communication systems, computer hardware or software, or specialty rolling stock, have been uniformly adopted in the City or otherwise standardized;

F. When the article can be cooperatively purchased more economically through the central purchasing authority of another governmental agency;

G. When specific used supplies, materials or equipment will best serve the City’s needs;

H. When reasonably necessary for the preservation or protection of public peace, health, safety or welfare of persons or property;

Provided, that even when procedures are dispensed with hereunder, City Council approval, by resolution, shall be required for purchases of $25,000 or more. (Ord. 2015-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

3.12.150 Compatibility of Equipment Between Departments.
With communication equipment, a coordination of effort between departments to ensure compatibility must be made. Communication equipment must allow for interdepartmental coordination, meaning that radio, telephone, computers, etc., will be compatible, to the extent possible, to assure continuous operation of emergency and day-to-day City functions. (Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

3.12.160 Competitive Negotiation.
As an alternative to the procedures set out in Articles III and IV of this chapter, in the case of obtaining consulting and other technical or highly specialized personal services, the City Administrator or her/his designee may authorize those services which may be obtained by competitive negotiations when:

A. The service involves a specialized knowledge or personal skill, such as attorneys, architects, accountants and specialized consultants; or

B. The supplies or equipment are such that suitable technical or performance specifications are not readily available, the City is not able to develop descriptive specifications, and proposals for the purchase would be more advantageous to the City.

The best offer as judged against proposal evaluation criteria shall be accepted. The use of competitive negotiations is not intended as a vehicle for the avoidance of the bidding procedures as set forth in this chapter. Any offer of $25,000 or more shall require approval by resolution of the City Council prior to acceptance. (Ord. 2015-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

Purchase of supplies, services, materials, or equipment, by contract, arrangement and agreement for cooperative purchasing programs with the State, county, or any other public or municipal corporation of the State may be made by the purchasing agent when the administering agency has made its purchases through a competitive bid process.

When the City can obtain a price advantage by purchasing from a supplier who has been awarded a contract for a specific item or items, equipment, service or materials, in a contract resulting from a formal competitive bid process by another governmental agency, said competitive process must entail all of the major protections as set forth in the bid process approved by the City Council of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea. (Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

3.12.180 Lowest Responsible Bidder – Determining.
For the purpose of this chapter, in addition to price, the “lowest responsible bidder” will be determined after the following factors have been considered:

B. Character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder;

C. Bidder’s record of performance of previous contracts or services;

D. Previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances related to the contract or service;

E. Sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;

H. Number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. In the event the lowest bidder is rejected, the purchasing agent or City Council (as the case may be) shall provide the lowest bidder with a written explanation or findings regarding the rejection;

I. In the case of a bid received from a bidder, a portion of whose sales tax is paid to the City, the purchasing agent shall calculate the actual cost to the City of accepting such bid. Said actual cost shall be the bid amount less sales tax revenue which would be received by the City were the City to accept such bid. Said actual cost shall be the price utilized by the City, in addition to the other factors set out in this section, in determining the lowest responsible bidder. (Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

3.12.190 Surplus Supplies and Equipment.

A), 2015; Ord. 2003-02 § 1, 2003).

D. To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 38 C.S. § 1, 1962; Ord. 224 N.S. § 1, 1956; Code 1975 § 300.0).

D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax article that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and, at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this article.

(Ord. 2012-08 § 1, 2012).

3.28.210 Place of Sale.
For the purposes of this article, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to the State sales and use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 2012-08 § 1, 2012).

3.28.220 Use Tax Rate.
An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the City of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date of this article for storage, use or other consumption in the City at the rate of one percent of the sales price of the property.

3.28.230 Adoption of Provisions of State Law.
Except as otherwise provided in this article and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted by reference and made a part of this article as if fully set forth herein.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A. Wherever the State of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of City shall be substituted therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made when:

3.32.010 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

A. “Hostelry” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location; provided, the mobile home or house trailer is not located within a mobile home park and the tenant is not an employee of the owner or operator of the mobile home or house trailer, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

B. “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hostelry for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

C. “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hostelry, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs her/his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as her/his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

D. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

E. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hostelry valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hostelry shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 79-21 § 7, 1979; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 450).

3.32.020 Tax Imposed.
A. For the privilege of occupancy in any hostelry, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10 percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City.

B. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hostelry at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hostelry. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hostelry, the City Clerk may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the City Clerk. (Ord. 98-1 § 1, 1998; Ord. 95-2 § 1, 1995; Ord. 83-22 § 1, 1983; Ord. 78-13 § 1, 1978; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 451).

3.32.030 Exemptions.
A. No tax shall be imposed upon the following:

1. Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax provided in this chapter;

2. Any Federal or State of California officer or employee when on official business;

3. Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of Federal law or international treaty.

B. No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Assistant City Administrator. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 452).

3.32.040 Duties of Operator.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hostelry shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 453).

3.32.050 Registration.
Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hostelry renting occupancy to transients shall register the hostelry with the Department of Administrative Services and obtain from it a “Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A. The name of the operator;

B. The address of the hostelry;

C. The date on which the certificate was issued;

D. “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Department of Administrative Services for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Department of Administrative Services. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hostelry without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 454).

3.32.060 Reporting and Remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of every other month (bi-monthly), or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the City Administrator make a return to the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea on forms provided by the Department of Administrative Services of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax owed to the City for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of tax owed to the City shall be remitted to the Department of Administrative Services. The City Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if s/he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and s/he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes owed to the City by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Department of Administrative Services. (Ord. 2007-11 § 1, 2007; Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 455).

3.32.070 Penalties and Interest.
A. Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10 percent penalty first imposed.

C. Fraud. If the Assistant City Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

D. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E. Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid in this chapter.

F. Monthly Payments. Any operator who fails to remit the full amount of quarterly tax due by the required deadline shall thereafter be obligated to remit monthly revenue statements and taxes owed. Such monthly remittance shall continue for a period of six consecutive months following the operator’s most recent infraction. Nonpayment of a monthly remittance will cause the operator to be subject to penalties and interest described within this section. Monthly revenue statements and taxes owed are due on or before the tenth calendar day of every month for the preceding month. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 456).

3.32.080 Failure to Collect and Report Tax – Determination of Tax by Assistant City Administrator.
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Assistant City Administrator shall proceed in such manner as may be deemed best to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Assistant City Administrator shall procure such facts and information as s/he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, s/he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Assistant City Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at the operator’s last known place of address. Such operator may, within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Assistant City Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Assistant City Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Assistant City Administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice, in the manner prescribed in this chapter, to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Assistant City Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in CMC 3.32.090. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 457).

3.32.090 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Assistant City Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at the operator’s last known place of address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 458).

3.32.100 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as the operator may have been liable for the collection and payment to the City, which records the Assistant City Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 459).

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Assistant City Administrator.

B. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Assistant City Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Assistant City Administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Assistant City Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes a right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 94-8 § 1, 1994; Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 460).

3.32.120 Actions to Collect.
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount. (Ord. 95 C.S. § 1, 1964; Code 1975 § 461).

B. The remainder of the first six percent, the additional two percent added by Ordinance No. 78-13, and the additional two percent added by Ordinance No. 83-22 shall be added to the General Fund for usual and current expenses.

Prior to issuance of a building permit or at such other time as required by law, the City shall require the applicant to pay the fee.

E. Impact fees shall be imposed and collected by the City and, along with any interest earned on the fees while in the possession of the City, shall be transmitted by the City to the RDIF Agency on the first day of each month for all fees collected during the prior month.

Reimbursement shall be from regional development impact fee revenues only, and the right to reimbursement shall be terminated 10 years from the date the applicant entered into the agreement for construction of the project.

The amount of credit, or the credit and reimbursement together, shall be in an amount equal to the cost of the regional transportation improvement project or portion thereof, as calculated by the RDIF Agency.

In such event, the amount of reimbursement shall be in an amount equal to the cost of the transportation improvement project or portion thereof, as set forth in the strategic expenditure plan, and shall be calculated by the City and the Treasurer of the RDIF.

If the business is owned, conducted or carried on by a corporation, such statement must be signed and filed by its president, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer, or managing agent. In the case of businesses rendering services, the gross revenue from services rendered shall be considered the equivalent of gross sales. In the case of businesses making sales and rendering services, the gross revenue from both sales and services shall be considered the equivalent of gross sales.

If the business is owned, conducted or carried on by a firm or copartnership, such statement must be signed and filed by one of the members or partners. If the business is owned, conducted or carried on by a corporation, such statement must be signed and filed by its president, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer, or managing agent. Any person who willfully files a false statement of gross receipts shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable as provided in this chapter. In the case of businesses rendering services, the gross revenue from services rendered shall be considered the equivalent of gross sales. In the case of businesses making sales and rendering services, the gross revenue form both sales and services shall be considered the equivalent of gross sales.

E. License Expiration. All business licenses shall be annual licenses and shall expire on the last day of June. (Ord. 2017-02 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.160 Penalties for Delinquent Payment.
A. License tax must be paid for all times during which a business is carried on within the City including periods when the business has been carried on illegally due to lack of a valid license.

B. If the tax is not paid within 30 days after it is due, a penalty of 25 percent of the tax due shall be added and an additional penalty of five percent shall be added every 30 days thereafter; provided, that the amount of such penalty to be added shall not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the license tax due. Since the tax is due annually on the last day of the month of June and becomes delinquent on the first day of August, the 25 percent penalty shall be added as of August 1st, and five percent penalties shall be added on the first day of each month thereafter until the penalty reaches 50 percent of the tax.

C. Taxes and penalties due from businesses which have been carried on without paying the administrative, application and inspection fees or the license tax shall be calculated from the first day of business as though the license had been applied for and renewed each year from the first day of business, but no administrative, application and inspection fees made or taxes paid. The penalties for any period of operation of a business for which the administrative, application and inspection fees have been made pursuant to CMC 5.04.140 (the period ordinarily covered by the administration, application and inspection fees for which taxes are calculated) shall be determined on the first day of the period.

Where the administration, application and inspection fees should have been paid for a new business, the first day of the period shall be the first day of business. The 25 percent penalty shall be assessed on the thirty-first day following the first day of the period and the five percent penalty shall be assessed at the end of each 30-day period thereafter. Thus, if a business has operated for a period of six months without paying the administrative, application and inspection fees as required, the penalty on the tax due for that period shall be 50 percent.

D. A business owner shall inform the City Administrator or her/his designated agent in writing of the date on which the business commenced along with the exact gross sales statements as required by CMC 5.04.140(D)(1) upon request of the City Administrator or her/his designated agent, and failure to furnish the statement or intentionally furnishing a false statement shall be a misdemeanor.

E. Penalties for delinquent payment of taxes shall not be waived and penalties shall be added automatically. It shall be the obligation of the business to furnish gross sales statements to the City annually and to pay the tax when due, and failure on the part of the City to send notice of the tax due shall be no excuse for failure to pay the tax on time. (Ord. 2017-02 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.170 Claims for Refund.
Any tax erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund is made within three years from the time of payment thereof. The administrative, application and inspection fees shall not be refundable. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.180 Licensed Businesses – Locations.
A. Every person engaging in any in-and-about business in the City, as defined in this title, and who has procured a license therefor, shall have the right to sell the goods, wares or merchandise or engage in the business for which the in-and-about license was issued at a fixed place of business without procuring any additional license therefor. Every person engaging in business at a fixed place of business in the City, as defined in this title, and who has procured a license therefor, shall have the right to deliver the goods, wares or merchandise for which the license was issued at any place in the City without procuring any additional license therefor. In the issuance of in-and-about licenses and licenses for fixed places of business or regular places of business, no discrimination or distinction shall ever be made against nonresidents of the City in favor of residents of the City, and residents and nonresidents of the City shall be entitled to equal rights in all matters relating to the issuance of licenses.

B. No bedroom of any place of business licensed, used and occupied as a hotel, motel, inn, roominghouse, lodginghouse or boardinghouse shall, for the purposes of this title, ever be construed to be a fixed place of business or a regular place of business other than such hotel, motel, inn, roominghouse, lodginghouse or boardinghouse. All persons claiming any such room of such hotel, motel, inn, roominghouse, lodginghouse, boardinghouse, used and occupied as such, shall, for the purposes of this title, be deemed to be conducting an illegal business. (Ord. 2017-02 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.190 Exemptions.
A. The provisions of this title shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a license fee to conduct, manage, or carry on any business, occupation or activity from any institution or organization which is conducted, managed or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes from which profit is not derived either directly or indirectly, by any individual, firm or corporation; provided, however, that nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to exempt any such institution or organization from complying with the provisions of this title requiring such institution or organization to obtain a license from the City Administrator or her/his designated agent to conduct, manage, or carry on any such business, occupation, or activity.

B. Interstate Commerce. Every peddler, solicitor or other person claiming to be entitled to exemption from payment of any license provided for in this title upon the grounds that such license casts a burden upon his right to engage in commerce with foreign nations or among the several States, or conflicts with the regulations of the United States Congress respecting interstate commerce, shall file a verified statement with the City Administrator or her/his designated agent having charge of the collection of licenses, disclosing the interstate or other character of the business entitling such exemption. Such statement shall state the name and location of the company or firm from which the orders are to be solicited or secured, the name and address of the nearest local manager, if any, the kind of goods, wares or merchandise to be delivered, the place from which the same are to be shipped or forwarded, the method of solicitation or taking orders, the location of any warehouse, factory or plant within the State of California, the method of delivery, the name and location of the residence of the applicant, and any other facts necessary to establish such claims of exemption. A copy of the order blank, contract form, or other papers used by such person in taking orders shall be attached to the affidavit. If it appears that the applicant is entitled to such exemption, such applicant shall forthwith be issued a no-fee license.

C. Peddlers and Solicitors.

1. No license tax for the purpose of peddling or soliciting shall be required of any honorably discharged or honorably released soldier, sailor or marine of the United States of America exempted from the payment thereof by any laws of the State of California; provided further, that each soldier, sailor or marine shall upon application therefor be issued such license free of cost upon presentation of a document or documents establishing this honorable discharge or honorable release from the United States Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force or Marine Corps.

2. No license tax for this purpose of peddling or soliciting shall be required of any blind person. A blind person, within the meaning of this section, means a person having not more than 10 percent visual acuity in the better eye, with correction. Such blindness shall be certified by a licensed physician or surgeon who specializes in diseases of the eye, and who is licensed to practice in the State of California, or by the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation of the Department of Education of the State of California, and the exemption provided by this section shall not apply until a certificate as to such blindness shall have been furnished to the City Administrator or other designated agent of the City.

E. Agricultural Food Vendors. Upon application by the persons raising the same, a license to peddle and/or sell agricultural food products grown or raised within the limits of the County of Monterey shall be issued by the City Administrator or her/his designated agent to the applicant with no charge to the applicant; provided, however, that such license shall authorize the peddling and/or selling of such products by the grower only. (Ord. 2017-02 § 2 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2007-05 § 1, 2007; Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.220 Duties of Police.
A. The Chief of Police or authorized officer of the City shall have and exercise the power:

1. To make arrests for the violation of any of the provisions of this title.

2. To enter, free of charge, at any time any place of business for which a license is required and provided and demand the exhibition of such license for the current term from any person, firm or corporation engaged or employed in the transaction of such business; if such person, firm, or corporation shall then and there fail to exhibit such license, such person, firm or corporation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be liable to the penalty or penalties provided in this title.

B. It is the duty of the Chief of Police to cause complaints to be filed against all persons, firms or corporations violating any of the provisions of this title. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

The City Council may at any time direct the City Attorney to bring suit in the name of the City for the recovery of a license tax against any person who engages in, conducts or carries on any business or game or exhibits any show or exhibition for which a license is required by the provisions of this title, without procuring such license and paying the prescribed license tax. In the event legal action is brought by the City to enforce collection of any license tax imposed by this title, such persons shall pay all costs of the suit incurred by the City or its assignee, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. In such actions for collections of a license tax imposed by this title, a civil penalty shall be added to the amount of any judgment recovered by the City, in addition to any other penalty then due and owing imposed by the provisions of this title. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

(Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.250 Business Name.
A. Purpose of Regulation. The City Council finds that in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea, in which there are no street numbers, the name of a business establishment is more than normally important to residents and visitors alike. Business names which tend to mislead or confuse the public as to type of business, the purpose of the business, or the manner in which the business is conducted, have a much greater adverse effect on the public in this City than in others, creating unnecessary parking and traffic problems and placing an unnecessary administrative burden on municipal employees in assisting members of the public in finding establishments sought for and in correcting misunderstandings created by misleading names. Further, names of business establishments which are sufficiently similar to create confusion between two or more businesses as determined by the Police and Fire Departments can lead to a serious hazard to the public health, welfare and safety, in that emergency response by police and fire personnel can easily be directed to the wrong location. A business license is issued to a specific business name and a new business license may be issued only upon change of business name in accordance with CMC 5.04.100(C).

B. Department of Community Planning and Building. No business license shall be approved or issued by the Department of Community Planning and Building in any name that would tend to mislead the public as to the type of business or the products or services offered for sale. Further, no license shall be issued to any applicant for a business name that is sufficiently similar to an existing and licensed business within the City as to cause confusion between the two establishments by either members of the public or municipal employees. Public Safety Departments shall review similar names prior to approval and provide their recommendations to the City Administrator who shall make such a determination. Within 10 days of the determination of the City Administrator, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.260 Refunds.
All business licenses shall be issued for the period of time set forth in this title and no licensee shall be entitled to the refund of the application and inspection fee or any portion of the tax paid by reason of the termination of such licensed activity prior to the expiration of the term for which the business license has been issued. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.04.270 Water Conservation.
No business license shall be issued for any new use not in conformance with CMC 17.08.050 and 17.08.060. Approval of business licenses to new businesses operating from a fixed location on any property within any commercial land use district shall require retrofitting of said property with water conservation devices in conformance with Monterey Peninsula Water Management District or City of Carmel-by-the-Sea ordinances, whichever is the most restrictive. (Ord. 96-12 § 1, 1996).

5.28.010 Use of Public Property for Filming.
The City Council finds that the uncontrolled use of public property and facilities for commercial filming can adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare through obstructing or interfering with the normal use of public streets, parks, buildings and other public facilities, that it can adversely affect the economic well-being of the business community by obstructing free access to business establishments within the City and by reflecting adversely on Carmel-by-the-Sea’s established public image. Therefore, the City Council determines that it is unlawful for any person, on any public property within the City, to film or videotape or otherwise record any scenes or actions or to use or obstruct any public property while filming on private property without a written permit from the City. (Ord. 89-5 § 1, 1989; Ord. 88-2 § 3 (Exh. C), 1988).

Note: A major production shall also require the approval of the City Council before a permit is issued.

2. Recommend that the Community Activities Department deny the application on the basis that granting it would be prejudicial to the public health, safety or welfare, or that it would adversely affect the economic welfare of the business community, or inconvenience residents or businesses, or interfere with or endanger the public peace or rights of residents to the quiet, peaceful, and unmolested enjoyment of their property.

D. Any decision made or conditions applied by the Chief of Police may be appealed to the City Council by filing with the City Clerk, in writing, a request for appeal and a statement of the reasons therefor. Any appeal must be filed within 24 hours of serving of notice to the applicant of the decision of the Chief of Police.

4. The Department has information that the prospective Proprietor or his or her agent or employee has violated any local, State or Federal tobacco control law, including this Chapter, within the preceding twelve (12) months; or

A. In addition to any other remedy authorized by law, after notice and opportunity to be heard pursuant to Section 7.80.120 of this Chapter, a License may be suspended or revoked as provided in this Section if the Health Officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the Licensee, or any of the Licensee’s agents or employees, has:

2. Pleaded guilty, "no contest" or its equivalent, or admitted to any of the following:

1. Upon a finding by the Health Officer of a first License violation, the License shall be suspended for sixty (60) days;

D. Violation by a Licensee at one location shall not be construed as a violation at another location of the same Licensee, nor shall violations by a prior Licensee at the same location be accumulated against a subsequent Licensee at the same location.

E. A License shall be revoked if the Health Officer finds that one or more of the grounds for denial of an application for a License pursuant to Section 7.80.060 existed at the time the application was made or at any time before the License was issued.

7.80.110 - Penalties for Tobacco Retailing without a License.

After a second violation of this Section at a location within any sixty (60) month period, no new License may issue for the Person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until one hundred and eighty (180) days have passed from the date of the violation.

3. After a third or subsequent violation of this Section at a location within any sixty (60) month period, no new License may issue for the Person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until five (5) years have passed from the date of the violation.

B. Any imposition of a penalty pursuant to this Section shall be in writing, setting forth the reasons for the imposition of a penalty and notifying the Person subject to the penalty that the decision to impose the penalty shall become final unless the Person seeks an appeal pursuant to Section 7.80.130 within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of service of the Health Officer’s decision. Service of the decision shall be provided in accordance with the service requirements set forth in Subsection A of Section 7.80.120.

As used in this chapter, “curbside” means such locations in the commercial districts and, when referring to the curbless residential district, it means an area on or immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way in front of the premises. Thus, “curbside collection” means the collection and removal by the collector of garbage, recyclables or yard waste placed at the curbside.

5. “Garbage” means such putrescible matter as regularly accumulates as an incident to the occupation of premises and shall be deemed to mean and made to include table refuse and every description of discarded matter, animal or vegetable (including unwashed glass, metal or plastic containers for the same), that attends the preparation, consumption, transportation or storage of meat, fish, fowls, fruits, vegetable and other foods of whatever character.

8. “Commingled recyclable materials” means a product that may be collected, sorted, cleansed, treated, and reconstituted into material that would otherwise become solid waste, and returned to the economic mainstream in the form of raw material for new, reused or reconstituted products which meet the quality standards necessary to be used in the marketplace.

8.44.010 Purpose.
It is recognized that much of the charm and appeal of the City to residents and visitors alike is due to its urban forest character, featuring the maintenance of Monterey pine, oak and other native trees or shrubs throughout the City. The City has determined to maintain this character which benefits both the residents, by giving them quiet, semiforested neighborhoods in which to live, and the business community, whose prosperity is so closely linked to the attractiveness of the City to visitors. The maintenance of an urban forest throughout the City necessarily involves some informality in the lighting, location and surfacing of street and sidewalk areas, which in turn involves greater risk to those wearing high heeled shoes more adaptable to formal city life. (Ord. 87 C.S. § 1, 1963; Code 1975 § 639.1).

8.44.020 Permit Required.
The wearing of shoes with heels which measure more than two inches in height and less than one square inch of bearing surface upon the public streets and sidewalks of the City is prohibited, without the wearer’s first obtaining a permit for the wearing of such shoes. (Ord. 87 C.S. § 1, 1963; Code 1975 § 639.2).

8.44.030 Permit Conditions – City Nonliability.
Any person desiring to wear shoes with heels in excess of the limitations set out in CMC 8.44.020 may do so by obtaining a permit from the City Clerk acknowledging that the permittee is familiar with the provisions of CMC 8.44.010 and by agreeing that upon the issuance of such permit s/he thereby relieves the City from any and all liability for damages to her/himself or to others caused by her/his falling upon the public streets or sidewalks of the City while wearing such shoes. (Ord. 87 C.S. § 1, 1963; Code 1975 § 639.3).

8.48.010 Declaration of Nuisance.
In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council finds and declares the following:

The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety or minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof on private or public property, including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this code. (Ord. 93-5 § 1, 1993; Ord. 241 C.S. § 1, 1971; Ord. 161 C.S. § 1, 1968; Code 1975 § 698.0).

8.52.010 Definitions.
A “security alarm device” is any system which, when activated, sounds an audible siren, horn, bell, or other sound-producing device from the interior or exterior of any privately owned structure within the corporate boundaries of the City or any device which gives an electronic signal to a telephone answering service or any attachment to a telephone which automatically reproduces recorded messages to alert public safety services or any other person or entity to an emergency. The term “security alarm device” as used in this chapter does not include the installation and operation of any approved system connected by lease line directly to the silent alarm monitoring equipment located at the Police Department of the City. (Ord. 81-18 § 1, 1981; Code 1975 § 699.90).

8.52.020 Installation Requirements – Sign.
Security alarm devices shall meet all Uniform Building Code and Uniform Fire Code requirements and be Underwriter Listed, whether installed by a private owner or a licensed alarm service. An identification sign shall be affixed on or near the main entrance to a structure in which a security alarm device is installed. The sign shall state the name, address and telephone number of the company, person or agency to be contacted in the event of alarm activation. The sign shall comply with the requirements for alarm device signs found in CMC 17.36.070. (Ord. 81-18 § 1, 1981; Code 1975 § 699.91).

8.52.025 Alarm Application and Operation Fee.
The owner, representative of the owner, or person installing a security alarm device shall, prior to installation of such device, pay an alarm application and operation fee for the alarm system. Said fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council, which may be amended from time to time. (Ord. 93-15 § 1, 1993).

8.52.030 Notification of Installation.
The owner, representative of the owner, or person installing a security alarm device shall, at the time of obtaining an alarm application and payment of operation fee, notify the Police Department in writing of:

A. The full name, address and telephone number of the owner of the structure alarmed;

B. The full name, address and telephone number of the person or entity causing the security alarm device to be installed;

C. The exact location of the premises alarmed;

D. Telephone number and at least one alternative telephone number to be called in the event of an emergency, along with the names or name of responsible persons with authority to act on behalf of the alarm owner;

8.52.040 Audible Alarm Time Limits – Reset.
Any audible exterior alarm shall automatically reset to the silent mode after being activated for a period not to exceed five minutes. The Chief of Police, at her/his sole discretion, may issue a written permit authorizing an audible exterior alarm to remain in the active mode for a specified period of time longer than five minutes upon a showing of circumstances unique to the alarmed structure which make it reasonable to allow a longer period of time. When considering a request for a permit to allow a longer period of time, the Chief of Police shall take into consideration the distance from other structures, the density of the vegetation around the structure, the loudness of the alarm, the number of inhabited structures in the neighborhood and any other factors. An audible exterior alarm which remains in the active mode for longer than five minutes or longer than the time specified in a permit issued by the Chief of Police is declared to be a public nuisance which may be summarily abated after a hearing by the Planning Commission and the expense of the abatement shall become a lien against the real property on which the alarm is maintained and a personal obligation against the owner of the real property and against the owner of the security alarm device. (Ord. 81-18 § 1, 1981; Code 1975 § 699.93).

8.52.050 False Alarm Charges.
Should the Police Department respond to a security alarm device which goes off or otherwise signals an emergency due to lack of care in the operation of such device by the owner or representative of the owner, a false alarm charge shall be payable by the owner of the security alarm device to the City, the amount of which false alarm charge shall be set from time to time by resolution of the City Council. Alarms activated by mechanical malfunction, line equipment problems or other causes not the fault of the owner shall not be subject to false alarm charges. (Ord. 81-18 § 1, 1981; Code 1975 § 699.94).

8.68.010 Findings and Purposes.
A. Plastic solid waste that is nondegradable or nonrecyclable poses an acute problem for any environmentally and financially responsible solid waste management program, according to a Plastics White Paper issued by the State of California Integrated Waste Management Board1. Such waste covers the City’s streets, parks, public places and open spaces and results in environmental damage and disruption of the ecological balance.

B. Products which are biodegradable/compostable or recyclable offer environmentally sound alternatives to nondegradable and nonrecyclable products currently in use. By decaying into their constituent substances, biodegradable and compostable products, compared to their nondegradable equivalents, are less of a danger to the natural environment and less of a permanent blight on the City’s landscape.

C. The release of chlorofluorocarbons (“CFCs”) into the environment may endanger public health and welfare by causing or contributing to significant depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, leading to increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation into the atmosphere. CFCs are manufactured chemicals that remain in the atmosphere for decades, slowly migrating upwards without reacting with any other chemicals.

D. The widespread use of CFC-processed food packaging poses a threat by the introduction of toxic byproducts into the atmosphere and environment of the City. Restricting the sale of CFC-processed food packaging in retail food establishments in the City would contribute to slowing ozone loss and greenhouse gas buildup, thereby protecting the public health.

E. In addition to emitting CFCs, plastic food service items take hundreds of years to decompose and cannot be recycled. However, these food packaging items can be and are made from other materials, such as recycled or virgin paper, and other biodegradable products which are not made using CFCs.

F. Polystyrene is a petroleum processing by-product. Oil is a nonrenewable resource obtained by increasingly hazardous methods including offshore drilling, which poses significant dangers to the environment. Alternative products which are biodegradable or recyclable pose fewer overall hazards than continued and expanded reliance on oil-based products.

G. Take-out food packaging constitutes the single greatest source of litter in the City and is a significant contributor to the total amount of waste entering the City’s waste stream. Minimizing the amount of disposable straws given out to customers and providing recyclable or compostable food wares will help reduce the amount of harmful plastic litter that ends up on our streets, in our storm drains and on our beaches, thus furthering the health, safety and welfare of the City.

H. Reduction of the amount of nondegradable and nonrecyclable waste that enters the waste stream and encouraging the use of recyclable and/or compostable containers further this goal.

I. At least 26 species of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) have been documented to ingest plastic debris2 and 52 percent of sea turtle species worldwide have ingested plastic3.

J. Approximately 10 to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans each year according to a WorldWatch Institute analysis. This plastic debris results in an estimated $13,000,000,000 a year in losses from damage to marine ecosystems, including financial losses to fisheries and tourism as well as time spent cleaning beaches4.

K. The City borders the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a Federal preserve that supports one of the most diverse and delicate marine ecosystems in the world. Eliminating the use of chlorofluorocarbons, polystyrene and other harmful materials from all establishments within the City, and promoting the transition to recyclable and compostable materials, will help protect this sanctuary. (Ord. 2017-11, 2017; Ord. 2008-05, 2008; Ord. 89-14, 1989).

The term “polystyrene” also includes clear or solid polystyrene.

M. “Prepared food” means food or beverages prepared for consumption on the food preparer’s premises, using any cooking or food preparation technique.

N. “Recyclable food packaging” means any food packaging including glass, cans, cardboard, paper, mixed paper or other items which can be recycled, salvaged, composted, processed or marketed by any means other than landfilling or burning, whether as fuel or otherwise, so that they are returned to use by society. It includes any material that is accepted by the City’s franchise waste hauler for recycling.

O. “Restaurant” means any establishment located within the City selling prepared food to be consumed on or about its premises by customers.

Any driver whose permit has been suspended may, within 10 days, file an appeal with the Regional Taxi Authority board of directors. If no appeal is received within 10 days, the taxicab permit shall be considered revoked and there will be no further right to an appeal, unless the Regional Taxi Authority finds that there are reasonable grounds for failing to appeal within the 10-day period. The board of directors shall hold a duly noticed public hearing within 60 days from receiving the appeal, unless the taxicab driver agrees to an extension or requests an expedited hearing. If an expedited hearing is requested the Regional Taxi Authority shall endeavor to set an earlier date for the hearing but is not required to set an earlier date.

The hearing shall comply with the applicable provisions for the protection of the due process rights of the taxicab driver and the taxicab driver will be given the opportunity to be heard. The Regional Taxi Authority board of directors shall adopt rules for conducting the hearing in compliance with applicable due process procedures. The board shall either grant or deny the appeal, based on substantial evidence and shall support its decision with factual findings, in writing. The decision of the board will issue within 10 days of the conclusion of the hearing and will be final. If the board upholds the appeal, the taxicab driver’s permit shall be reinstated. If the board denies the appeal, the taxicab driver’s permit shall be revoked and may only be reinstated as set forth in this chapter.

A taxicab driver shall not operate a taxicab during the time period in which the driver’s permit is suspended. The Regional Taxi Authority may, but is not required to, issue a temporary permit, as set forth below, which will allow the taxicab driver to temporarily operate until such time as the Regional Taxi Authority board of directors has issued a final decision. In order to issue such a permit, the Regional Taxi Authority must, in addition to the requirements set forth below, make findings that the public safety and health will not be harmed by the issuance of a temporary driver’s permit and unusual circumstances exist which require the issuance of a temporary driver’s permit.

H. Temporary Permits. The Regional Taxi Authority, in its sole discretion, may grant a temporary permit to drive or operate any taxicab, pending final action on any application for a permanent taxicab driver’s permit as provided in this chapter, but no such temporary permit may be issued to any person who does not have a valid driver’s license issued by the state, who is not employed or possessing a written offer of employment as a taxicab driver in the City, or who has not provided evidence of negative controlled substance and alcohol testing as required by CMC 9.80.240.

I. Records to Be Kept by the Regional Taxi Authority. The Regional Taxi Authority shall keep a record of each driver granted a taxicab driver’s permit under the provisions of this chapter, which record shall contain the full name, age, residence, places of residence for two years preceding the date of application, race, weight, height, color of eyes and hair, fingerprints, place of birth, places of previous employment covering three years preceding the date of application, whether the driver has ever been convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor, and whether he or she has ever been previously licensed as a driver, and if so, whether his or her license has ever been revoked and for what cause. (Ord. 2010-4 Att. B, 2010).

9.80.240 Mandatory Controlled Substance and Alcohol Testing Program.
A. Each taxicab driver shall test negative for each of the controlled substances specified in Part 40 (commencing with Section 40.1) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, before employment. Each driver shall test negative for these controlled substances and for alcohol as a condition of the driver’s annual permit renewal. As used in this section, a “negative test for alcohol” means an alcohol screening test showing a breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent.

B. Testing procedures shall be substantially as set forth in Part 40 (commencing with Section 40.1) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, except that each driver shall show a valid California driver’s license at the time and place of testing, and except as provided otherwise in this section. Requirements for rehabilitation and return-to-duty and follow-up testing and other requirements, except as provided otherwise in this section, shall be substantially as set forth in Part 382 (commencing with Section 382.101) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

C. A test in one jurisdiction shall be accepted as meeting the same requirement in the City or in any other jurisdiction. Any negative test result shall be accepted for one year as meeting a requirement for periodic permit renewal testing or any other periodic testing in the City or any other jurisdiction, if the driver has not tested positive subsequent to a negative result. However, an earlier negative result shall not be accepted as meeting the pre-employment testing requirement for any subsequent employment, or any testing requirements under the program other than periodic testing.

D. In the case of a self-employed independent driver, the test results shall be reported directly to the Regional Taxi Authority, and the Authority shall notify the taxicab leasing company of record, if any, of positive results. In all other cases, the results shall be reported directly to the driver’s employer, who shall immediately notify the Authority of the results.

E. All tests are confidential and shall not be released without the consent of the driver, except as authorized or required by law.

F. Self-employed independent drivers shall be responsible for compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with regard to themselves. In all other cases, taxicab owners and employers of drivers shall be responsible for compliance with, and shall pay all costs of, this program with respect to their employees and potential employees, except that an employer may require employees who test positive to pay the costs of rehabilitation and of return-to-duty and follow-up testing.

G. Taxicab owners, employers of drivers, and self-employed independent drivers shall pay all service charges, fees, or assessments established by the Regional Taxi Authority with respect to the owner’s employees and potential employees in an amount sufficient to pay for the Authority’s costs of carrying out the mandates of this section.

H. No evidence derived from a positive test result pursuant to the program shall be a criminal prosecution concerning unlawful possession, sale or distribution of controlled substances.

I. For purposes of this section, “employment” includes self-employment as an independent driver or owner/operator of a taxicab. (Ord. 2010-4 Att. B, 2010).

9.80.250 Taximeters.
A. Required in Taxicabs. No person shall operate any taxicab in the City until such taxicab is equipped with a taximeter of a type and design which has been approved by the Regional Taxi Authority.

All taxicabs operated under the authority of this chapter shall be equipped with taximeters which conform to all applicable State of California laws and regulations and shall be inspected, sealed, and certified by the county department of weights and measures.

B. Inspection Required – Removal of Vehicle with Inaccurate Meter.

1. Every taximeter shall be inspected and tested for accuracy by the owner at least annually. Taximeters shall be subject to inspection at any time by the Regional Taxi Authority or any other authorized persons. Upon discovery of any inaccuracy of such taximeter, the operator thereof shall remove, or cause to be removed, from service any vehicle equipped with such taximeter until such taximeter has been repaired and accurately adjusted.

2. Records and evidence of inspection by the county department of weights and measures shall be submitted for verification at the time of each taxicab’s annual vehicle inspection.

C. Manner of Placement in Taxicabs. The taximeter required by this chapter shall be placed in each taxicab so that the reading dial showing the amount to be charged is well lighted and readily discernible to a passenger riding in any such taxicab.

D. Accurate Operation Required. It shall be the duty of each person operating a taxicab, and the driver thereof, to keep the taximeter therein operating at all times within the accuracy and requirements of this chapter and such additional requirements as may be prescribed from time to time by the Regional Taxi Authority.

E. Use Required for All Passenger Services. No passenger shall be carried in any taxicab for hire unless the taximeter in such taxicab is in operation. This section shall apply regardless of whether the taxicab is engaged for a trip entirely within the Regional Taxi Authority area or partially outside thereof, and such meter shall be kept operating continuously during the entire time that it is engaged in the transportation of passengers for compensation, regardless of the point of destination; except, that when the trip is in excess of 15 miles a flat rate may be used for any part of the trip over the first 15 miles.

F. All Charges to Be in Accordance with Meters. All charges for taxicab service shall be calculated and indicated by a taximeter, except as described in this chapter, and at all times while the taxicab is engaged the flag of the taximeter shall be thrown into a position to register charges for mileage and time. No taximeter shall be so operated as to cause any charge to be registered thereon except during the time while the taxicab is engaged by a passenger.

G. Splitting of Fares by Two or More Passengers. If two or more persons going in the same direction share a taxicab the first party that is discharged from the taxicab shall pay the charge on the meter, and the meter shall then be flagged and a new fare started; except and unless if the driver agrees at the inception of the hire to drop the first fare without re-flagging and starting a new fare.

H. Proper Use of Flag Required. No driver of any taxicab, while carrying passengers, shall display the flag attached to the taximeter in such a position as to denote that such vehicle is not employed, or fail to throw the flag of the taximeter to a position indicating such vehicle is unemployed at the termination of each service. (Ord. 2010-4 Att. B, 2010).

The City Council finds and determines that operations of radio dispatched tow truck services that, on a contract basis, make periodic patrols of the parking facilities of private businesses and residences to locate and tow away or impound illegally or improperly parked motor vehicles, while providing a useful service to the property owners or lessees in question and/or their apartment managers, have resulted in numerous complaints and have led to serious altercations and an inordinate number of public disturbances in neighboring cities and towns.

12.04.010 General.
While the need for sidewalks in the majority of the commercial districts is recognized, it shall continue to be the policy of the City to avoid formal sidewalks in favor of meandering and unpaved footpaths where possible. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1214.0).

12.04.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this code, the following definitions shall apply:

A. “Footpath” means unpaved, unimproved pathway used by pedestrians, in which no artificial grading or material has been used.

B. “Walkway” means a graded and cleared pathway, surfaced with semipermanent materials, other than paving.

C. “Work” means whatever is done, whether with or without a permit. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1214.01).

12.04.030 Permit Required.
No sidewalk or walkway shall be constructed without a permit therefor issued by the Director of Public Works. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1214.02).

12.04.040 Cost of Construction.
The cost of construction of sidewalks, curbs and gutters shall be borne by the owner of the adjacent property, unless otherwise determined by the City Council. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1214.03).

12.04.050 Sidewalks in the Commercial Districts.
No sidewalk or walkway shall be constructed in the commercial districts without a permit therefor from the Director of Public Works. Prior to the issuance of a permit, the Planning Commission, as part of the design review process, will determine the type of material to be used. In the absence of Planning Commission review, the City Administrator, in conjunction with the Director of Community Planning and Building, will determine the type of material. Such permit shall specify the type of material, the permitted area of coverage, type and materials of curb, if any, and size and type of planted areas. All sidewalks and walkways in the commercial districts shall be constructed to the established grade, unless otherwise permitted by action of the City Council. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1215.0).

12.04.080 Residential Sidewalk Construction.
No sidewalk or walkway shall be constructed in the residential district without a permit therefor issued by the City.

12.04.110 Notice to Repair.
Upon becoming aware of any dangerous or defective sidewalk or walkway, or other encroachment in the sidewalk area, the Director of Public Works shall notify, in writing, the person owning or having control of the property. Such notice shall be in accordance with regulations set forth in the Streets and Highways Code of the State of California and shall direct the repair or correction of the hazardous or defective condition within 14 days from date of notice. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1217.01).

12.04.120 Liability for Damages.
After receipt of notice as provided for above, any owner or person responsible for the property shall become liable for damages suffered to any person or to the property of any person lawfully using such sidewalk or walkway, driveway, curb or gutter, suffered as a result of the dangerous condition thereof.

(Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1217.03).

12.04.140 Assessment by City.
Following the repair, as provided for above, the City Attorney shall take such steps as may become necessary to assess and collect the costs of such repair, in the manner provided for in Chapter 22 of Part 3 of Division 7 (Section 5600 et seq.) of the Streets and Highways Code of the State of California. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 79-21 § 34, 1979; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1217.04).

12.04.150 Illegal Acts.
It is unlawful for any person to:

A. Construct or maintain any sidewalk, walkway, footpath, or other permanent or semipermanent encroachment on City property without first having obtained a permit therefor as required by this code.

12.04.160 Abatement of Illegal Work.
Anyone violating this chapter by performing any of the acts prohibited, without first obtaining an appropriate permit therefor, in addition to all other penalties which may be assessed for violation of this code, shall remove the work done without a permit and restore the property to the condition it was in prior to the performance of the work. The removal and restoration shall be at the expense of the person or persons violating this chapter. Where the work is done by someone other than the owner of the adjoining property, at the request of the owner, both the owner and the person performing the work shall be deemed to have violated this chapter and both shall be obligated to remove and restore. (Ord. 85-37 § 1, 1985; Ord. 318 C.S. § 1, 1974; Code 1975 § 1217.11).

Before receiving an encroachment permit, and as a condition of that permit, the permittee shall execute an agreement holding the City harmless from any and all claims, actions and demands of third parties of any kind, character and description arising out of or due to any accident or mishap in, on or about said encroachment so constructed or maintained or any error or omission resulting in personal injury or property damage.

The limit of insurance and any other requirements relating to the insurance required may be adjusted by the City Council from time to time by resolution. The insurance carrier shall certify that the insurance is currently in force and that it will notify the City 10 days in advance of any material change in the policy, including cancellation or nonrenewal thereof. This insurance shall be primary over any other collectible or valid insurance the City may have. In addition, the bonding requirement set forth in Chapter 12.16 CMC shall be met for an encroachment involving excavation work. The City shall have the executed hold harmless agreement recorded with the Monterey County Recorder’s office. The recorded document becomes a permanent record, and an encroachment permit and its conditions run with the land. In the event of change of ownership of the property, the terms and conditions of the hold harmless agreement are conveyed with the title. (Ord. 89-26 § 1, 1989; Ord. 89-9 § 1, 1989).

For water system transmission lines, sanitary system transmission lines and reclaimed water system lines, the application shall be accompanied by a duly executed utility easement between the City Council and the party making application and by a conditional use permit issued pursuant to City ordinances. In considering whether to grant use permit applications, the City Council, in addition to other policies and factors required by ordinance or law, shall consider the actual and potential environmental impact upon the City and the surrounding community, and upon adjoining properties. The City Council shall also consider the project’s consistency with the City’s adopted General Plan and ordinances. (Ord. 89-9 § 1, 1989).

12.08.125 Nonconforming Existing Encroachments.
A. At the transfer of property ownership or the issuance of a building permit, the Building Official shall inspect the public right-of-way adjacent to the affected private property. He/she shall require the abatement of any nonconforming encroachments or the property owner may submit an application for an encroachment permit that will be processed in accordance with CMC 12.08.050.

B. City staff may cooperate with the property owner to help remove and dispose of asphalt that has not been authorized by the City.

C. The City may plant trees and native vegetation, if appropriate, in areas where asphalt has been removed. (Ord. 96-6 § 1 (Exh. A), 1996).

12.08.130 Revocation of Permit and Abatement.
A. Revocation. The City Council reserves the right to revoke any encroachment permit at any time if the permit is not in the public interest or if it fails to meet the other requirements of this chapter. Failure of the permit holder to maintain the required insurance or pay an assessed fee shall result in the immediate revocation of the permit. The City Council may order the removal of the encroachment by the permittee. Should a permittee fail to comply with the Council’s order for removal, the City may undertake the removal of the encroachment. In that event, the City’s costs of removal shall be assessed against the permit holder and/or the property and become a lien against the property.

B. Determination of Nuisance. Whenever the City Administrator, or his/her designate, determines that an encroachment exists contrary to one or more of the provisions of this chapter, the encroachment shall be considered a nuisance and abatement proceedings may be initiated by the City.

C. Notice to Owner. Immediately upon determination by the City Administrator that an encroachment constitutes a public nuisance, the City Administrator shall cause a copy of this section to be sent by certified mail to the last address of record of the permittee, together with a notice setting forth the details of the nuisance and the requirements of its abatement. The notice shall advise the permittee that the nuisance shall be abated within 30 days. If the City Administrator determines that the encroachment constitutes an immediate threat to health or safety, s/he shall then cause the encroachment to be abated in the most expeditious manner available, giving the permittee a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to be heard on the issues of abatement and nuisance.

D. Notice to City Council. In the event the nuisance is not abated by the permittee within the specified time, the City Administrator shall forward to the City Clerk a request for resolution by the City Council, indicating that adequate notice has been given the permittee concerned and that the nuisance still exists.

E. Nuisance Hearing. The City Clerk shall place on the agenda of the City Council a resolution declaring the encroachment to be a nuisance and setting a hearing thereon. The Clerk shall cause a copy of the resolution to be sent by certified mail to the permittee a reasonable time, or at least 10 days, prior to such hearing.

F. Notice of Public Nuisance – Posting.

1. After the passage of such resolution, the City Administrator shall cause to be conspicuously posted on, or adjacent to, the property upon which said public nuisance is alleged to exist not less than three notices headed, “Notice to Abate Public Nuisance,” such heading to be in letters not less than one inch in height and such notice to be on a form supplied by the City Clerk.

2. The notices shall be posted at least five days prior to the time for hearing objections to the abatement of such public nuisance.

G. Council Decision. At the time stated in such notices, the City Council shall hear and consider all objections, if any, to the proposed abatement, and may continue the hearing from time to time. Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the City Council shall, by resolution, allow or overrule any and all objections; whereupon the City Council shall have acquired jurisdiction to proceed and perform the abatement, and the decision of the City Council on the matter shall be final and conclusive.

H. Abatement of Nuisance. After final action has been taken by the City Council to abate a nuisance, or in case no protests or objections have been received, the City Council shall, by resolution, order the City Administrator to abate the nuisance. The affected permittee and/or property owner shall have the right to have any such encroachment removed at his/her own expense, providing the same is done prior to the arrival of the City staff or contractor to remove the same.

I. Cost of Abatement. The City Administrator shall keep an account of the cost of abating such nuisance and shall submit an itemized statement thereof to the City Council at its next regular meeting, and shall forthwith send by certified mail a true and correct copy of such statement to the permittee and/or the owners of such premises. In the event that any such permittee or owner is unknown, the statement shall be posted on the bulletin board of City Hall for one week, giving notice when such statement will be submitted to the City Council for approval.

J. Assessment Against Owner. At the time for receiving and considering such statement, the City Council shall proceed to consider the same and the objections thereto, if any, and may raise, lower, or modify the amount alleged to be due therein. The determination of the City Council, as aforesaid, shall be final and conclusive, and the amounts of the cost of abating such nuisance upon the parcel of land mentioned in the statement shall constitute special charges and assessments against the permittee and/or the property, respectively. Upon confirmation of such statement, a full and correct copy thereof shall be delivered to the Monterey County Assessor and the Assessor shall add the amounts set forth in such statement and charged against any lot, piece, or parcel of land, to the amount assessed against the same for municipal taxes and assessments, and thereafter said amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City taxes are collected, and such special assessments shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. Any assessment or charge against any property owner or permittee may be enforced by the City Attorney through the courts. The City shall be entitled to recover its reasonable court costs in connection with any such action.

K. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the City, acting through the City Attorney, from seeking judicial relief to abate any condition which constitutes a nuisance, or an immediate threat or danger to health or safety, pursuant to State law or any other ordinance. (Ord. 89-9 § 1, 1989).

12.08.140 Waiver of Liability.
It is expressly provided that the provisions for hold harmless agreements and insurance and the acceptance of such agreements or certificates shall not be construed so as to prohibit or limit the City’s right to remove or cause the removal of such encroachments as it may from time to time deem advisable, pursuant either to applicable general law or other provisions of this code. (Ord. 89-9 § 1, 1989).

It is unlawful for any person to construct or cause to be constructed any private driveway over and/or across any publicly-owned park strip, sidewalk or right-of-way area; to cut, break, remove and/or cause to be cut, broken or removed any curbing or sidewalk or to surface or cause to be surfaced with any concrete, bituminous product (asphalt), decomposed granite or any other similar substance any publicly owned park strip, sidewalk and right-of-way area on any public street within the City without first obtaining a permit to do so from the Department of Community Planning and Building in conjunction with the Director of Public Works and the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach. (Ord. 93-2 § 1, 1993; Ord. 153 N.S., 1953; Code 1975 § 1209).

12.24.020 Permit – Conditions.
No permit shall be issued under CMC 12.24.010 unless the proposed alteration or project complies with the following:

A. The maximum width of any driveway shall not exceed 14 feet as measured at the front property line or at any point between the front property line and its connection with the street pavement edge. A flare of a 30-inch radius shall be allowed at each side of the driveway at the street pavement edge connection. There shall be a short return of asphalt material at the street connection for transition of street to driveway. The length of this return shall be approved by the Director of Public Works.

B. The materials allowed for driveways upon the public right-of-way shall be approved by the Departments of Community Planning and Building and Public Works. Materials shall be consistent with the general neighborhood appearance and in conformity with the General Plan of the City. The installation of materials shall follow all the requirements set forth in the instructions and requirements for work permits. Loose material or material that could cause damage to public street maintenance equipment, e.g., gravel, sand, pebbles or any other materials that readily displace are prohibited within the public right-of-way.

C. All applications for driveways and subsequent permits shall be subject to landscaping requirements within the public right-of-way as approved by the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach. The City has determined that the public right-of-way area is reserved primarily as a “landscape and greenbelt buffer zone” and shall be maintained by the owner of the property immediately adjacent to the subject right-of-way area. The Director of Forest, Parks and Beach shall require all plant life to be California native or of a drought-tolerant nature.

D. No driveway shall be so constructed as to impede or interfere with the drainage of surface waters, and in this connection shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Director of Public Works and Director of Forest, Parks and Beach.

E. Not more than one driveway shall be constructed upon any lot of record. Exception: Corner lots may have one driveway constructed upon each street and lots with a street frontage of greater than 80 feet may have up to two driveways.

F. The minimum distance between driveways serving the same lot or parcel of land shall be not less than 18 feet as measured at the front property line parallel to the street edge.

G. No driveway shall be so located as to interfere with intersecting sidewalks, traffic sign posts, lamp posts, fire hydrants, utility poles or any other public conveyance (trees).

H. Any abandoned driveway shall be removed and the curb and sidewalk (if any) shall be restored to a greenbelt buffer zone at the expense of the owner of the abutting property under the supervision of the Director of Public Works and Director of Forest, Parks and Beach.

I. No driveway shall be constructed upon the publicly-owned sidewalk area, park strip, right-of-way area or street except in compliance with the permit issued by the City. Such permit shall impose conditions consistent with standards for safety, drainage, utility and/or aesthetics and shall state the grade level at which the driveway shall cross over an existing or future curb or sidewalk. Where no curb and/or sidewalk is in existence at such grade, the permit may allow the driveway surfacing to start at the edge of the present street surfacing and follow the existing contours of the ground in the public right-of-way. The permit may allow cuts and fills only as may be necessary for the property owner to gain access to his/her property. The grade of the sloped portion of the access route measured along the centerline shall not exceed 10 percent in the first and last five feet or 25 percent in the intervening distance. The driveway profile shall be constructed so that vehicles can safely and conveniently traverse it and should provide a smooth transition between grades. A transition shall be constructed utilizing a vertical curve of 30 feet or longer where the change in grade is greater than five percent.

J. Where no official grade has been established or where the official grade has been established and the existing driveway does not conform, a conditional permit may be granted for resurfacing of the existing driveway at the existing grade. In the event an official grade is established or the street is brought to a grade different from the existing grade or the driveway is lower than the centerline of the street, the property owner must bring the driveway to proper grade at no expense to the City. In lieu of bringing the driveway to grade, a signed, notarized driveway grade/drainage agreement may be submitted by the property owner relieving the City of any future reconstruction or water damage liability and holding the City and its employees harmless therefrom.

K. When any portion of any publicly-owned sidewalk area, park strip or right-of-way area shall be paved or surfaced, a minimum of 18 inches shall be left open around the base of any tree to allow for growth.

L. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the Building Official and/or Director of Public Works from imposing any requirements deemed necessary to promote safety and welfare for the City.

12.24.030 Safety Requirements.
During the construction of any driveway or surfaced area, the owner of the property to be served shall maintain the area in a safe manner and shall provide adequate barricades and warning lights at his/her own expense to protect the safety of the public using the adjacent streets and/or sidewalks and shall hold the City and its employees harmless from any damages incurred by his/her operations. (Ord. 93-2 § 1, 1993; Ord. 153 N.S. § 4, 1953; Code 1975 § 1211).

12.24.050 Inspection.
Before any driveway or surfaced area may be used, it shall be inspected and approved by the Director of Public Works and Director of Forest, Parks and Beach. In the event the same shall not be approved after inspection, and if not made to conform within 14 days, then all work and material shall be removed and the area replaced in the same condition prior to the commencement of work at the expense of the owner of the abutting property, provided it is in a safe condition as determined by the Director of Public Works. (Ord. 93-2 § 1, 1993; Ord. 153 N.S. § 5, 1953; Code 1975 § 1213).

12.28.010 Purpose and Intention.
The City Council finds that it is necessary to maintain the existing urban forest in order to preserve windbreak protection, abate soil erosion, and enhance the natural beauty of the City, and adopts this chapter in the interest of public health and safety. (Ord. 79-5 § 1, 1979; Ord. 214 C.S. § 1, 1970; Code 1975 § 1230).

12.28.020 Policy Statement.
It is not the policy of the City to approve requests for tree trimming or tree removal in order to improve the view of any person, including the applicant. It is the policy of the City, where tree removal is accomplished at the request of a property owner or occupant, to require the planting of another tree in a suitable location, whenever good forestry practice so dictates. (Ord. 79-5 § 1, 1979; Ord. 214 C.S. § 1, 1970; Code 1975 § 1230.01).

12.28.030 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

A. “Shrub” means a bushy, woody plant, usually with several permanent stems, and usually not over 10 to 15 feet high at maturity.

B. “Tree” means a woody perennial plant, usually with one main stem or trunk, and many-branched. It may appear to have several stems or trunks, as in certain varieties of oak. It is usually over 10 feet high at maturity. (Ord. 79-5 § 1, 1979; Ord. 214 C.S. § 1, 1970; Code 1975 § 1230.1).

12.28.040 Determination of Definition.
In any case, the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach shall have the right to determine whether any specific woody plant shall be considered a tree or a shrub. Such determination shall be final and not subject to appeal. (Ord. 79-5 § 1, 1979; Ord. 214 C.S. § 1, 1970; Code 1975 § 1230.2).

12.28.050 Solar Shade Control Act.
The City is exempt from the provisions of Chapter 12 (commencing with Public Resources Code Section 25980), Division 15 of the Public Resources Code which chapter is known as the “Solar Shade Control Act.” (Ord. 79-5 § 1, 1979; Code 1975 § 1230.3).

12.28.060 Permit for Cutting Trees and Shrubs on Public Property.
A. Any person desiring to remove or prune any portion of a tree or shrub, except genista, growing in or upon any public street, way, park, or place within the City, or any person desiring to cut any wood, foliage, or roots from any tree on private property when more than one-half of the basal cross-sectional area of such tree is on City property, shall apply therefor to the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach on forms provided by her/him. There shall be a fee for this permit process as established from time to time by resolution of the City Council. If, in the opinion of the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach, the tree or trees should be removed because of disease, infestation, or clear and present danger to persons or property, she/he shall cause the tree or trees to be removed. In all other cases, the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach shall:

1. Place the application on an agenda of the Forest and Beach Commission, which shall act as provided for in Chapter 2.32 CMC; and

2. Notify the applicant of the time and date of the meeting at which the application shall be considered; and

3. Give notice of the action of the Forest and Beach Commission to the applicant.

B. Any permit granted under this chapter is nontransferable and shall expire one year from date of issuance. The Director of Forest, Parks and Beach or Forest and Beach Commission may condition a permit on replacement trees being planted at a place, of a species and of a size designated by the Director of Forest, Parks and Beach or Forest and Beach Commission. The person requesting the permit will be required to pay the cost of obtaining and planting the replacement trees.

C.

12.40.010 Council Findings.
The City Council finds and declares that the uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in the public right-of-way creates physical danger to the traveling public and the numerous pedestrians that use the public rights-of-way in the City. Moreover, the City Council finds that in recognition of the unique architectural features and basic heritage of the City, the clutter and congestion of numerous disparate types of newsracks in the public rights-of-way is unsightly and not in keeping with the rustic nature of the village. The City Council also finds, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to these areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The City Council further finds that the public interest requires that newsrack facilities of uniform and coordinated construction and appearance be utilized and these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this chapter, designed to accommodate such interests by regulating the time, place and manner of using such newsracks. (Ord. 86-1 § 1, 1986).

B. “Newsracks” means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser installed, used or maintained for the sale of newspapers, news periodicals or other news publications.

C. “Parkway” means that area between the edge of the roadway and the adjacent property line, excluding that area occupied by the sidewalks. Parkway shall also include any area within a roadway which is not open to vehicular travel.

The evidence of insurance filed with the City shall include a statement by the insurance carrier that 30 days’ notice will be given to the City before any cancellation.

B. Indemnification. Every person operating or maintaining a newsrack upon or within the public property, rights-of-way or public easements adjacent to streets of this City shall agree, prior to the granting of an encroachment permit, to indemnify and hold harmless the City, its officers and employees from any loss, liability, damage or cost sustained by any person or property, arising from the installation, operation or use of such newsrack; provided, however, that such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the City, its officers and employees shall not extend to any loss, liability damage or cost resulting from the acts or property of another.

13.32.020 Findings.
The City Council finds that the development of cable systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents of the City. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable systems, the City Council further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City or such persons as the City may designate. It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable service to the public and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this as an integral finding thereof. It is the further intent of this chapter to establish regulatory provisions that permit the City to regulate cable system franchises to the extent permitted by Federal and State law, including but not limited to the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, applicable Federal Communications Commission regulations and applicable California law.

B. The requirements of subsection (A) shall apply to any change in control of grantee. The word “control” as used herein includes majority ownership, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the Council shall be required where ownership or control of more than 20 percent of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively.

C. Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be considered by grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply.

D. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall assist grantor in such inquiry. In seeking grantor’s consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the grantee and/or the proposed transferee complete an application in accordance with Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or equivalent. An application shall be submitted to Grantor not less than 120 days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise. If the grantor has not taken action on the grantee’s request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, grantor’s consent to such transfer shall be deemed given. The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed.

(Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 6.7), 1998).

13.32.120 Nonexclusive Franchise.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable State and Federal law; provided, that if the grantor grants an additional franchise on terms more favorable to the second grantee (whether by the grant of greater benefits or the imposition of lesser obligations), or if another entity utilizing the public rights-of-way offers service competitive with grantee, then the material provisions of any such additional franchise shall be reasonably comparable to the terms and conditions contained in the initial grantee’s franchise, so that all grantees are accorded competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory treatment and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 6.8), 1998).

13.32.130 Multiple Franchises.
A. Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable State or Federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as:

1. The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.

2. The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service.

3. The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way.

B. Where electric and telephone utilities are to be placed underground in residential housing developments, grantor and the developer of such new residential housing shall give each grantee serving the franchise area within which the new residential housing development is located at least 72 hours’ prior written notice of the date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee’s installation of conduit, pedestals and vaults. On request of the grantor or developer, the grantee shall provide specifications needed for trenching. Developers of new residential housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two new entrant cable systems and dedicate the use of such conduit to the City.

C. Grantor may require that any new entrant, nonincumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in grantor’s opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 6.9), 1998).

13.32.140 Filing of Applications.
Any person desiring an initial franchise for a cable system shall file an application with the City. A reasonable nonrefundable initial application fee established by the City shall accompany the initial franchise application to cover all validly documented reasonable costs associated with processing and reviewing the application, including without limitation costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the applicant, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication requirements with respect to the consideration of the application and document preparation expenses. In the event such validly documented reasonable costs exceed the application fee, the selected applicant(s) shall pay the difference to the City within 30 days following receipt of an itemized statement of such costs.

A. Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the City Manager or a delegate shall prepare a report and make recommendations respecting such application to the Council.

B. A public hearing shall be set prior to any initial franchise grant, at a time and date approved by the Council. Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the Council shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or not the initial franchise(s) should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The Council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 7.3), 1998).

13.32.170 Franchise Renewal.

1. Has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner; or

2. Has not diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation;

he Council may impose one or more of the remedies provided in this chapter and the franchise agreement as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate under the circumstances. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 15.2), 1998).
13.32.390 Grantor’s Power to Revoke.
A. Grantor may revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter and rescind all rights and privileges associated with it in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default by grantee and a material breach under the franchise:

1. If grantee fails to perform any of its material obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement and continues such failure to perform after receipt of due notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure;

2. If grantee fails to provide or maintain in full force and effect the insurance coverage or security fund as required in the franchise agreement;

3. If grantee violates any order or ruling of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the grantee’s franchise, unless such order or ruling is being contested by grantee in good faith in an appropriate proceeding;

4. If grantee knowingly practices any material fraud or deceit upon grantor;

5. If grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt.

B. After completing the procedures set forth in CMC 13.32.380, the grantor may make a formal request before the Council that the grantee’s franchise be revoked. The Council shall cause to be served on the grantee written notice of its intent to consider revoking grantee’s franchise. Such notice shall be served on grantee at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing on the issue. The notice shall contain the time and place of the hearing and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the franchise area 10 days prior to the hearing date.

C. The Council shall hear any person(s) interested in the revocation and within 90 days after the date of the hearing shall make its determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the grantee has committed a material breach of the franchise.

D. If the grantor determines that the grantee has committed a material breach, then the grantor may:

1. Declare the franchise revoked and the security fund and bonds forfeited; or

2. If the material breach is curable by the grantee, direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within the time and manner and under the terms and conditions reasonably specified by the grantor.

The termination and forfeiture of the grantee’s franchise shall in no way affect any right of grantor to pursue any remedy under the franchise or any provision of law. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 15.3), 1998).

13.32.400 Appeal of Finding of Revocation.
The grantee may appeal a finding of revocation made pursuant to CMC 13.32.390 to an appropriate court of jurisdiction, which shall have the power to review “de novo.” Any such appeal must be taken by the grantee within 60 days of the issuance of the grantor’s decision to revoke the franchise. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 15.4), 1998).

13.32.410 Force Majeure – Grantee’s Inability to Perform.
In the event grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is prevented by a cause or event not within grantee’s control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof; provided, however, that such inability to perform shall not relieve a grantee from the obligations imposed by CMC 13.32.200(C) pertaining to refunds and credits for interruptions in service. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of grantee shall include without limitation acts of God, war, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, labor disputes, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and fires, but shall not include financial inability of the grantee to perform or failure of the grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of grantee, or the failure of the grantee to secure supplies, services or equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure such supplies, services or equipment. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 16), 1998).

13.32.420 Abandonment or Removal.
A. If the grantee discontinues the use of any of its property within the public rights-of-way for a continuous period of 12 months, such property shall be deemed to have been abandoned by grantee. Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part thereof shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use.

B. Grantor, upon such reasonable terms as grantor may lawfully impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned aboveground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore any affected public right-of-way to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were installed. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments. Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the public rights-of-way, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and the security fund as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with the terms and conditions of this section.

C. Upon the approved abandonment of any franchise property, the grantee, if required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument, satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership of the abandoned franchise property.

D. At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided herein, in any such case without renewal, the grantor shall have the right to require grantee to remove, at its own expense, all aboveground portions of the cable system from all streets and public ways within the service area within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180 days.

E. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other franchise holder. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 17.1), 1998).

13.32.430 Restoration by Grantor –Reimbursement of Costs.
Upon reasonable written notice and upon the failure of the grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work to be done in any public right-of-way required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may cause the work to be commenced and/or completed. The grantor shall provide to the grantee an itemized work order setting forth in detail the exact nature of the work completed and the supplies used in such work. The grantee shall pay to the grantor the reasonable costs for such work no later than 30 days after receipt of the itemized work order. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 17.2), 1998).

13.32.440 Extended Operation and Continuity of Services.
Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall have the discretion to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time. Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available services; provided, that financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. The grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 17.3), 1998).

13.32.450 Receivership and Foreclosure.
A. At the option of the grantor and subject to applicable law, a franchise granted hereunder may be revoked 120 days after appointment of a receiver(s) or trustee(s) to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless:

1. The receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated within said 120 days; or

2. Such receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor; or

3. Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, have executed an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise.

B. In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the cable system, in whole or in part, the grantor may serve notice of revocation upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall be revoked 30 days after service of such notice, unless:

13.32.470 Waiver.
The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by Federal or State regulation, if the grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or on the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 18.2), 1998).

13.32.480 Rights of Individuals.
A. Grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age or sex.

B. Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local regulations, as now written or as amended from time to time.

C. Neither grantee nor any person, agency, or entity shall, without the subscriber’s consent, tap, or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service, polling with audience participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be identified.

D. In the conduct of providing its cable services or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber’s or general citizen’s right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law. The grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system’s interactive two-way equipment or capability, if such equipment or capability exists, for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen.

E. No cable line, wire amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment owned by grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber’s premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon subscriber’s property shall be deemed granted.

F. The grantee, or any of its agents or employees, shall not sell or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber pursuant to State and Federal privacy laws:

1. Any list of the names and addresses of subscribers containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; and

2. Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit the grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 18.3), 1998).

13.32.490 Separability.
If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any Federal or State agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or State law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had previously been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee; provided, that grantor shall give grantee 30 days’ written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision. (Ord. 98-7 § 1 (Exh. A § 19), 1998).

14.04.010 Purpose.
It is found and declared that in the event of a significant local earthquake, loss of life or serious injury may result from damage to or collapse of buildings in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea. It is generally acknowledged that the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea will experience earthquakes in the future due to its proximity to both the San Andreas and Hayward faults. The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety by identifying those buildings in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea which exhibit structural deficiencies and by determining the severity and extent of those deficiencies in relation to their potential for causing loss of life or injury. The City Council finds it desirable to identify the hazards that these deficiencies may pose to occupants of buildings, adjacent structures and pedestrians in the event of an earthquake. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.020 Definitions.
A. “Bearing wall” means any wall supporting a floor or roof where the total superimposed load exceeds 100 pounds per linear foot, or any unreinforced masonry wall (over six feet high) supporting its own weight.

B. “Building”, for the purpose of determining occupant load, means any contiguous or interconnected structure; for purposes of engineering evaluation, it means the entire structure or a portion thereof which will respond to seismic forces as a unit.

C. “Capacity for transfer” means the maximum allowable capacity of a structural system or connection to resist in a ductile manner the lateral forces it would encounter due to earthquake forces.

D. “Civil engineer” or “structural engineer” means a licensed civil or structural engineer registered by the State of California pursuant to the rules and regulations of Title 16, Chapter 5 of the California Administrative Code.

E. “External hazard” means an object attached to or forming the exterior facade of a building which may fall onto pedestrians or occupants of adjacent buildings. Examples of this type of hazard include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Nonstructural exterior wall panels, such as masonry infill or decorative precast concrete.

2. Parapets.

3. Marquees, awnings or other roof-like projections from a building.

4. Masonry or stone wall veneer and wall ornamentation, including cornices or other decorative appendages.

5. Masonry chimneys.

6. Tile roofing.

7. Wall signs and exterior lighting fixtures hung from a building exterior.

8. Fire escapes or balconies.

F. “Geometry” means a building’s shape or configuration, including setbacks of wall/column lines, reentrant corners, discontinuities in vertical and horizontal lateral force diaphragms, open storefront and building stiffness variations due to the distribution of resisting elements or the use of materials or differing properties within the same structural element, or other irregularities in plan or elevation.

G. “Occupants” means the total occupant load of a building determined by Table 33-A of the 1973 Uniform Building Code or the actual maximum number of occupants in that building if that number is less than 75 percent of the number determined by using Table 33-A. The number of actual occupants may be documented by counting actual seating capacity if permanent seating is provided in the occupancy, or by employee and client counts which can be substantiated as a practical maximum use of the space in the building. The Chief Building Official will establish the procedure for documenting occupant loads.

H. “Solution” means any approved method that will provide for the transfer of lateral forces through a system or connection to a degree which will substantially eliminate a potential collapse. A general description of the methods and materials to be used shall be included in sufficient detail to allow for a cost estimate of the solution to be made (i.e., adding shear walls, overlaying horizontal diaphragms, strengthening critical connections, etc.).

I. “Unreinforced masonry (URM)” building means any building containing walls constructed wholly or partially with any of the following materials:

1. Unreinforced brick masonry.

2. Unreinforced concrete masonry.

3. Hollow clay tile.

4. Adobe or unburned clay masonry. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.030 Scope of Program.
A. Applicability. The following buildings in Carmel-by-the-Sea shall be required to have an engineering report submitted to the Department of Community Planning and Building to determine: (i) the existence, nature and extent of structural deficiencies which could result in any structural failure; and (ii) the existence, nature and extent of deficiencies in the anchoring of external hazards:

1. Buildings constructed of unreinforced masonry (URM), except those of less than 1,900 square feet containing six or fewer occupants.

(Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.050 Engineering Reports.
A. Reports shall be prepared by a civil or structural engineer licensed in the State of California.

B. Purpose. To investigate, in a thorough and unambiguous fashion, a building’s structural systems that resist the forces imposed by earthquakes and to determine if any individual portion or combination of these systems is inadequate to prevent a structural failure (collapse or partial collapse).

C. General. Each building shall be treated as an individual case without prejudice or comparison to similar type or age buildings which may have greater or lesser earthquake resistance. Generalities or stereotypes are to be avoided in the evaluation process by focusing on the specifics of the structural system of the building in question and the local geology of the land on which the building is constructed.

D. Level of Investigation. Some buildings will require extensive testing and field investigation to uncover potential structural deficiencies, while others will allow the same level of overall evaluation by a less complicated process due to simplicity of design or the availability of original or subsequent alteration design and construction documents. It is the responsibility of the engineer performing the evaluation to choose the appropriate level of investigation which will produce a report that is complete and can serve as a sound basis for a conclusion on the collapse hazard the building may present.

E. Format for the Report. The following is a basic outline of the format each engineering report should follow. This outline is not to be construed to be a constraint on the professional preparing the report, but rather to provide a skeleton framework within which individual approaches to assembling the information required by this chapter may be accomplished. It also will serve as a means for the City to evaluate the completeness of each report.

1. General Information. A description of the building including: (a) the street location, lot number, block number, assessor’s parcel number; (b) the type of occupancy use within the building, with separate uses that generate different occupant loads indicated on a plan showing the square footage of each different use; (c) plans and elevations showing the location, type and extent of lateral force resisting elements in the building (both horizontal and vertical elements); (d) a description of the construction materials used in the structural elements and information regarding their present condition; (e) the date of original construction, if known, and the date, if known, of any subsequent additions or substantial structural alterations of the building; and (f) the name and address of the original designer and contractor, if known, and the name and address of the designer and contractor, if known, for any subsequent additions or substantial structural alterations.

2. Investigation and Evaluation of Structural Systems. All items to be investigated and the methods of investigation for each type of building under consideration are contained in Appendices A and B, available from the City’s Department of Community Planning and Building.

3. Test Reports. All field and laboratory test results shall be included in the report. Evaluation of the significance of these test results shall be made with regard to each structural system or typical connection being evaluated. This evaluation may be limited to a statement of the adequacy or inadequacy of the system or connection based on the lateral load demand it would be required to resist by calculation. If tests reveal inadequacy, a conceptual solution must be included in the report.

4. Conclusions. Based on the demand/capacity ratio and the specific evaluation items contained in Appendices A or B, a statement shall be provided explaining the overall significance of the deficiencies found to exist in the building’s lateral force-resisting system regarding potential collapse or partial collapse failure.

5. Recommendations. An appropriate solution, which could be used to strengthen the structure to alleviate any collapse or partial collapse threat, shall be specified.

F. Exceptions and Alternatives. Exceptions to the report requirements may be granted by the Chief Building Official upon review of a written request from the engineer preparing the report. Such a request shall provide evidence that the required item(s) can be determined by alternate means or that a conclusion can be made about the item without following the solution called for in the appropriate appendix. In no case will an exception be granted which will result in an item not being completely evaluated. The decision of the Chief Building Official in granting exceptions is final. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.060 Review of Reports.
A. The City may utilize the services of civil or structural engineers to assist the Chief Building Official in determining if the submitted engineering reports conform to the requirements of this chapter.

B. The cost of this review shall be recovered by a fee assessed against the building owner based on the time required for the review. This fee amount shall be deducted from the plan checking fee collected for any future construction work that deals directly with correcting any of the structural inadequacies specified in the engineering report.

C. Copies of the engineering reports shall be available to interested individuals for a standard copying fee or may be reviewed at the Department of Community Planning and Building offices. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.070 Responsibilities of the Building Owners.
A. Notification of Building Tenants. A building owner shall notify all tenants, in writing, that a structural seismic investigation has been performed and that the report is available at the Community Planning and Building offices. This notice must be sent within 30 days of the date the report is submitted to the City.

B. Letter of Intent. A building owner shall submit a letter to the Department of Community Planning and Building within one year of the date the engineering report was received by the Department of Community Planning and Building, indicating the owner’s intentions for dealing with the potential seismic inadequacies found to exist in the building. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.080 Program Status Reports to the City Council.
The Chief Building Official shall submit a report to the City Council on the status of the seismic hazards identification program when completed. The report shall include information regarding the number of buildings analyzed, the severity of the structural inadequacies discovered and any actions taken by individual building owners to correct these inadequacies. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

14.04.090 Remedies.
It shall be unlawful for the owner of a building identified as being included in the scope of this chapter to fail to submit a report on either building collapse hazards or external hazards or to fail to submit a letter of intent within the time period specified in CMC 14.04.040(C). The following remedies are available to the City:

A. The City may seek injunctive relief on behalf of the public to enjoin a building owner’s violation of this chapter.

B. These remedies are not exclusive. (Ord. 89-8 § 1, 1989).

Appendix A
Procedures for Investigation of All Buildings (Except Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Types)
A. Preliminary Field Survey. Provide drawings of the building in plan, elevations and section sufficiently detailed to reveal the correct dimensions of the spans and extent of all structural elements in the building, including openings in walls and changes in framing directions or other data which will be used to evaluate the building.

B. Areas of Special Investigation.

1. Specify the type of roof diaphragm used in the building and its capacity for transfer of lateral forces.

2. If the building is multi-story specify the existing floor diaphragm at each level above the foundation and give its capacity for transfer of lateral forces.

3. Specify the types and spacing of connections used at each level to transfer the forces of the horizontal diaphragms into the vertical shear resisting elements of the structure, and the capacity for transfer of each type of connection present in the building.

4. Specify the type of vertical structural elements which resist lateral forces and their individual capacities as determined either by testing or use of standard values for the types of construction found in the vertical elements.

5. Specify the type and spacing of connections used to connect vertical shear resisting elements to each other and to the building foundation, and the capacity for transfer of each type of connection present.

6. Specify the type of foundation system used and note any evidence of settlement.

7. Specify the type of connection used to attach wall appendages or precast wall elements to the structural frame.

Standard for the Analysis and Evaluation of All Buildings (Except Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Types)

A. Purpose. The objective of these investigations is to identify and quantify the structural inadequacies that may be present in a building which could lead to a collapse or partial collapse during an earthquake. The focus of the reports should be:

1. Determining the potential life safety danger that the building presents to its occupants;

2. The potential threat to pedestrians or occupants of adjacent buildings from falling external hazards; and

3 The potential hazard of horizontal sway causing damage to an adjoining structure.

B. Capacity vs. Demand of the Existing Structural System and its Elements.

1. Define the overall type of lateral force-resisting system used in the building based on Table 23-1 of the 1973 Uniform Building Code. If the building has a dual or hybrid system, describe the systems and explain how they function both in combination and separately to justify the “K” factor to be chosen.

2. For each type of lateral force-resisting system provide an analysis of the loads (demand) which these elements would be subject to based on the design parameters set forth in the 1973 Edition of the Uniform Building Code.

3. For each type of lateral force-resisting system determine a maximum capacity based on currently accepted or published allowable values, adjusted as appropriate for the material involved when used to resist earthquake forces.

4. Provide a ratio of theoretical capacity to demand for each system or interconnection evaluated in subsection (B)(2) and (B)(3) above and provide a statement of the significance of this ratio, regarding the potential for a collapse.

C. Specific Evaluation Items. The report shall contain a statement regarding the significance of each item in this section which is found to occur in the building.

1. General.

a. Assess the condition of the structure, the quality of workmanship, the level of maintenance and the type of construction with regard to the potential loss of strength in the structural systems due to decay or deterioration.

b. Assess the redundancy exhibited in the structural system and the reserve capacity that elements of the systems may provide.

c. Assess the presence or lack of ductility in the lateral force-resisting elements and ductility differences due to the use of dissimilar materials in the horizontal and vertical diaphragms.

d. Assess how adequately the building is tied together to allow the lateral force-resisting systems an opportunity to receive the forces each is designed to resist.

2. Geometry.

a. Consider how and where torsional (rotation) forces, induced by the eccentricity of the building center of mass to its center of rigidity, are taken into the lateral force resisting system and identify the individual elements which will transmit these additional forces. Assess the potential capacity these elements have to resist the additional loads from this source.

b. Consider the effects of discontinuities in the lateral force-resisting systems with regard to the existence of adequate ties, boundary members, chords or drag struts, etc., to allow redistribution of forces. Assess the capacity of the systems or elements which would receive the redistributed forces if adequate ties exist.

c. Consider the effects of reentrant corners (including the shape of individual columns) and assess their contribution to the response of the building at locations where they occur.

3. Building Separation.

a. Consider the effects of adjoining buildings, which may have different vibration periods resulting in nonsynchronized movement of the adjacent exterior walls, placing out-of-plane impact forces on these walls.

b. Assess the level of drift control, particularly at open storefronts and the actual physical separation distance between the exterior walls of the building and adjoining building walls.

c. Assess conditions where the wall of a building on one property provides support for structural elements of the adjoining property’s building.

4. Nonductile Reinforced Concrete Frames.

a. Consider nonductile frames which act alone without the benefit of shear walls or braced frames.

b. Assess the level of compression of shear forces due to existing vertical loads on the critical supporting elements of the frame.

c. Assess masonry infill walls between frame members and their effect on the forces a column/beam joint will be subjected to when attempting to transmit lateral forces into these walls.

5. Precast Concrete Connections.

a. Assess the effects of temperature creep and shrinkage of concrete surrounding welded insert connections to precast systems and elements.

b. Consider the potential brittle failure of such connections.

6. Nonstructural Elements.

a. Assess the effect that partitions, infill walls, precast concrete exterior (architectural) elements and ceiling systems which have considerable strength and stiffness characteristics may have on the overall response of the building.

b. Assess the effect of inadvertent bracing by nonstructural elements such as infill walls, stair stringers or other situations of localized restraint on columns.

c. Assess the potential stress concentrations at the unrestrained ends of columns which may result from partial restraint or bracing of columns.

7. Site Geology.

a. Consider the maximum ground-shaking intensity for the building site and liquefaction potential or susceptibility by using available earthquake hazard maps.

b. Assess any existing site specific geology/soils reports to gauge the effects that the local conditions may have on the overall response of the building.

Procedures for Investigation of Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings
A. Preliminary Field Survey. Prepare framing plans for roof and floors noting all beams, trusses or major lintels of all URM piers or pilasters. Prepare elevations of all URM walls noting all openings in the walls and any discontinuities above the building base.

B. Special investigations of the following nature must be made:

1. Note all parts of the vertical load-carrying system that may act as ties to lateral load-resisting elements to determine the elements or systems that may control relative displacements between the building’s base, floors and roof.

2. Note on floor plans all interior crosswalls that are continuous between floors or floor and roof, even if the connection of such walls to the floor or roof is only by finishes.

3. Draw the relationship of roof or floor framing and ceiling framing to determine the extent and method, if any, of their interconnection.

4. Draw the support systems for URM walls that are not continuous to the building base noting the materials used to provide that support, i.e., steel frame, concrete frame, etc.

5. Draw on floor and roof plans the extent of sheathing and finish materials and describe their nature and nailing pattern. Note any difference in materials used which could lead to substantial variations in diaphragm stiffness. Openings in floors or roofs adjacent to URM walls must be noted. Note the type of roofing system currently in place and note if this roofing is applied directly to the main roof deck or if there are locations where it is on a cricket or other superimposed deck.

C. Investigation of Current Anchorage of URM Walls to Floor and Roof. Show the location of all wall anchors on the floor/roof plans and specify their spacing, size, and method of connection. Details of the existing anchorage system should be prepared. Embedded portions of anchors must be exposed to determine this level of detail. A minimum of two percent or two anchors exposed per floor or roof level should establish average conditions.

D. Investigation of Existing URM Walls. Investigate the following items, if they occur in the building, and determine:

1. The thickness of URM walls at all levels and location of any changes in thickness.

2. The materials used for lintels and masonry arches and their bearing area on columns or piers.

3. The materials used in columns or piers supporting lintel beams or arches.

4. The height of parapets, cornices, and gable ends of URM walls above the uppermost existing anchorages.

5. The anchorage or bonding of terra cotta, cast stone or similar facing to the backup wythes of brickwork at cornices and other architectural appendages.

6. The coursing of exterior wythes of masonry, the bonding of wythes of masonry, and the materials used in each wythe.

7. The condition of mortar joints and areas of lightly unburned brick should be noted on the wall elevations. Existing cracks in wall elements should also be noted.

E. Testing. The testing of existing anchorage systems must be made to determine an average capacity. Testing shall be accomplished in accordance with the following requirements:

1. Existing Wall Anchors of URM Buildings. Five percent of existing rod anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved testing laboratory. The minimum tested quantity shall be four per floor or roof level, with two tests at walls with framing perpendicular to the wall and two at walls with framing parallel to the wall.

The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested. Where due to obstructions this is not possible, details of the condition encountered and the alternate method used must be included in the test result, with calibration adjustment for conditions where the reaction of the test apparatus contributes to the tension value of the anchor.

The rod anchor shall be given a preload of 300 pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load reported shall be recorded at one-eighth-inch relative movement of the anchor to the adjacent masonry wall surface.

The testing of existing URM walls to determine the allowable bed-joint shear is required in accordance with the following requirements.

2. In-Place Shear Tests of Brick Masonry. The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent bricks in that wythe. The opposite head joint of the brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. Steel bearing plates of the full dimension of the brick shall be inserted at each end of the test jack. The bearing plates shall not contact the mortar joint. The minimum quality mortar in 80 percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of 30 psi when reduced to an equivalent zero axial stress. The shear stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed joints and shall be that at which movement of the adjacent brick is first observed.

The minimum quantity of tests shall be two per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force, i.e., per story, or one per 1,500 square feet of total URM wall surface, with a minimum of eight tests for any building. The tests should be conducted at least two brick courses above or below the bond course and be distributed vertically to include a variety of dead load surcharge situations. The exact test location shall be determined at the building site by the engineer responsible for the investigation and the distribution of such tests must be approved by the Building Official prior to actual testing. In single-story buildings, the wall above the lintel beam at an open storefront need not be tested.

Standards for the Analysis and Evaluation of Unreinforced Masonry Bearing Wall Buildings

A. Purpose. The objective of these standards is to establish a basis for proper analysis and evaluation for determining the seismic lateral forces affecting unreinforced masonry buildings and their potential life/safety threat.

B. Analysis.

1. General. The total lateral seismic forces should be computed in accordance with the following equation:

V = ZIKCSW

The value of KCS need not exceed the value set forth in Table 14A. The value of Z and I shall be equal to 1.0. The value of W shall be as set forth in the Uniform Building Code.

2. Lateral Forces on Elements of Structures. Parts or portions of buildings and structures shall be analyzed for lateral loads in accordance with Chapter 23 of the UBC but not less than the value from the following equation:

Fp = IcpSWp

For the provisions of this section, the product of IS need not exceed 1.0. The value of Cp and Wp shall be as set forth in the Uniform Building Code.

Exception: Unreinforced masonry walls may be analyzed in accordance with subsection (B).

3. The elements of buildings required to be analyzed shall include the following:

a. Wall height to thickness ratio.

b. Tension bolts for bending.

c. In-plane shear forces.

d. Parapets.

e. Diaphragm stress and diaphragm chords at floors and roof.

4. Anchorage and Interconnection. Anchorage and interconnection of all parts, portions and elements of the structure shall be analyzed for lateral forces in accordance with the UBC and the formula in subsection (2) above. Masonry walls shall be anchored to all floors or roof to resist a minimum of 200 pounds per linear foot acting normal to the wall at the level of the floor or roof or will be considered inadequate.

5. Required Analysis. Except as modified herein, the analysis and recommended structural alteration of the structure shall be in accordance with the analysis specified in the UBC. A complete, continuous load path from every part or portion of the structure to the ground shall be shown to exist for required lateral forces. All parts, portions or elements of the structure shall be shown to be interconnected by positive means.

6. Analysis Procedure. Stresses in materials and existing construction utilized to transfer seismic forces from the ground to parts or portions of the structure shall conform to those permitted by the Uniform Building Code and those types of materials of construction specified under the Materials of Construction subsection (B). In addition to the seismic forces required, unreinforced masonry walls shall be analyzed as specified in the Uniform Building Code to withstand all vertical loads. When calculating shear or diagonal tension stresses due to seismic forces, existing masonry shear walls may be allowed to resist 1.0 times the required forces in lieu of the 1.5 factor required by the Uniform Building Code. No allowable tension stress will be permitted in unreinforced masonry walls. Walls not capable of resisting the required design forces specified in this appendix shall be deemed inadequate.

Exception: Unreinforced masonry walls which carry no design loads other than their own weight may be considered as veneer if they are adequately anchored to elements which are not part of the existing lateral force resisting system.

7. Existing Materials. When stress in existing lateral force-resisting elements is due to a combination of dead loads plus live loads plus seismic loads, the allowable working stress specified in the Uniform Building Code may be increased 100 percent. However, no increase will be permitted in the stresses allowed in subsection (B). The stresses in members due only to seismic and dead loads shall not exceed the values permitted in the Uniform Building Code.

8. Allowable Reduction of Bending Stress by Vertical Load. Calculated tensile fiber stress may be reduced by the full direct stress due to vertical dead loads.

B. Materials of Construction.

1. General. All materials permitted by this code, including their appropriate allowable stresses and those existing configurations of materials specified herein, may be utilized to show adequacy of existing construction.

2. Existing Materials. Unreinforced masonry walls analyzed in accordance with this appendix may provide vertical support for roof and floor construction and resistance to lateral loads. The bonding of such walls shall be as specified in the Uniform Building Code.

Tension stresses due to seismic forces acting normal to the wall may be neglected if the wall does not exceed the height-to-thickness ratio and the in-plane shear stresses due to seismic loads set forth in Table 14D. If the wall height or length-to-thickness ratio exceeds the specified limits, the wall will be considered inadequate unless braced by vertical members designed to satisfy the requirements of the Uniform Building Code. The deflection of such bracing members at design loads shall not exceed one-tenth of the wall thickness.

Exception: The wall may be supported by flexible vertical bracing members designed in accordance with this appendix if the deflection at design loads is not less than one-quarter nor more than one-third of the wall thickness.

All vertical bracing members shall be attached to floor and roof construction for the design loads independently of wall anchors. Horizontal spacing vertical bracing members shall not exceed one-half the unsupported height of the wall or 10 feet, whichever is less.

3. Existing Roof, Floors, Walls, Footings and Wood Framing. Existing materials, including wood shear walls may be used as part of the lateral load resisting system; provided, that the stresses in these materials do not exceed the values shown in Table 14C. Wood shear walls may be recommended to strengthen portions of the existing seismic resisting system.

4. Minimum Acceptable Quality of Existing Unreinforced Masonry Walls. All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry vertical loads and seismic forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane shall be tested as specified in subsection (E) of the investigation portion of this appendix. All masonry shall be of a quality not less than the minimum standards established or shall be considered inadequate. Pointing of mortar of all masonry wall joints may be performed prior to testing if joints are raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar shall be Type S or N, except under the continuous inspection of a special inspector, whose reports shall be included in the final report.

5. Determination of Allowable Stresses for Design Methods Based on Test Results. Design seismic in-plane shear stresses shall be related to test results in accordance with Table 14C. Intermediate values between 3 and 10 psi may be interpolated.

Compression stresses for unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of 3 psi shall not exceed 100 psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be permitted.

6. Construction Details. All unreinforced masonry walls shall be anchored at all floors and roof with tension bolts through the wall or by existing rod anchors at a maximum spacing of six feet. All existing rod anchors shall be secured to the joists to develop the required forces. Testing of the existing rod anchors shall be conducted according to subsection (E) of the investigation portion of this appendix.

Diaphragm chord stresses of horizontal diaphragms shall be developed in existing materials or be considered inadequate.

Where trusses or beams other than rafters and joists are supported on masonry piers, these piers must be shown to provide adequate support during seismic loading.

Parapets and exterior wall appendages not capable of resisting the forces specified in this appendix shall be considered hazardous, and methods for property anchorage must be developed.

No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful. The issuance of a permit based upon plans and specifications shall not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring corrections of errors in said plans and specifications or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this code or of any other ordinance of the City.

B. Time Limitation of Applications. Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of the application shall expire, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official.

Expiration of Permits.

The Building Official may grant a one-time permit extension of 180 days provided the applicant submits a request in writing prior to the permit expiration and the project has not changed in scope. Additional extension requests of 90 days may be granted by the Building Official if the request is made in writing, the project has not changed in scope, the project has obtained at least one inspection approval and the applicant pays a fee as prescribed in the City’s fee schedule for each 90-day extension.

All existing projects are subject to this section and will be subject to the conditions listed above.

C. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever such permit is issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any law or ordinance. Whenever any work is being done contrary to the provisions of the code or other laws of the City, the Building Official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served upon any person engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done, and such person shall forthwith stop such work until authorized by the Building Official to proceed therewith. No person shall perform any of the work authorized by a permit after such permit has been suspended or revoked. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018; Ord. 2017-04 § 1 (Exh.

Expansion tanks used in potable water systems intended to supply drinking water shall be in accordance with NSF 61. The expansion tank shall be properly sized and installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions and listing. Systems designed by registered design professionals shall be permitted to use approved pressure relief valves in lieu of expansion tanks provided such relief valves have a maximum pressure relief setting of 100 psi or less.

Section 710.1 is hereby amended to read as follows:

710.1. In every case where the outlet of a trap for a plumbing fixture is installed or located at an elevation which is less than two feet (2’) above the rim of the nearest manhole uphill from the point of connection of the building sewer to the public sewer in any new or existing drainage system, approved types of backwater valve, relief vent, and cleanout shall be installed in the building sewer at the point of lowest elevation of the ground surface of the building site outside of the building or at such other location as is permitted by the Building Official, providing that at any such location, the elevation of the ground surface is not less than two feet (2’) below the lowest trap outlet served by the building sewer.

The installation shall consist of an approved fresh air inlet and a Y branch or combination fitting installed in sequence in the line of flow from the building. The vent from this fresh air inlet shall be piped to the ground surface and capped with a vent cap. Provision shall be made by elevation above the ground or by other means for preventing the obstruction of the vent opening or the flow of water therein. The cleanout shall be placed as close to the valve as is practical and shall be piped to within one foot (1’) of the ground surface and closed with an approved cleanout plug. Every existing installation which includes a plumbing fixture trap outlet which is less than two feet (2’) above the rim of the nearest manhole uphill from the point of connection of the building sewer to the public sewer is hereby declared to be dangerous, unsanitary, and a menace to life, health, and property. Whenever it shall come to the attention of the Building Official that such an installation exists, he or she is hereby empowered to order and require that such plumbing outlet be immediately plugged or capped, or that the equipment described in the preceding paragraph of this section be installed immediately.

15.56.010 General Provisions.
A. Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

B. Findings of Fact.

1. The flood hazard areas of Carmel-by-the-Sea are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

2. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.

C. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

1. Protect human life and health;

2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

7. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

8. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

D. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:

1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;

5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.020 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

A Zone. See “Special flood hazard area (SFHA).”

“Accessory structure” means a structure that is either:

1. Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or

2. A small, low-cost shed for limited storage, less than 150 square feet and $1,500 in value.

“Accessory use” means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.

“Alluvial fan” means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone- or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

“Appeal” means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

Area of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area (SFHA).”

“Base flood” means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100-year flood”). “Base flood” is the term used throughout this chapter.

“Base flood elevation (BFE)” means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1 – A30, VE and V1 – V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

“Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material, which are not part of the structural support of the building and which are designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

Building. See “Structure.”

“Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as Zone V1 – V30, VE, or V.

“Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before December 9, 1997.

“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

“Flood,” “flooding,” or “floodwater” means:

1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

2. The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the floodway.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

“Floodplain” or “flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See “Flooding.”

“Floodplain Administrator” is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.

“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

“Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “regulatory floodway.”

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization,” as related to CMC 15.56.220, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Governing body” is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

“Hardship,” as related to CMC 15.56.220, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a State inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved State program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Levee system” means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition).

1. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

a. The flood openings standard in CMC 15.56.150(C)(3);

b. The anchoring standards in CMC 15.56.150(A);

c. The construction materials and methods standards in CMC 15.56.150(B); and

d. The standards for utilities in CMC 15.56.160.

2. For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see “Basement” definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle.

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

“Market value” is defined in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea substantial damage/improvement procedures. See CMC 15.56.120(B).

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

“New construction,” for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after December 9, 1997, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after December 9, 1997.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

One-Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year Flood. See “Base flood.”

“Primary frontal dune” means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.

“Program deficiency” means a defect in a community’s floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations.

“Public safety and nuisance,” as related to CMC 15.56.220, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

“Sand dunes” means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

Sheet Flow Area. See “Area of shallow flooding.”

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1 – A30, AE, A99, AH, V1 – V30, VE or V.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of an historic structure; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure.

V Zone. See “Coastal high hazard area.”

“Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. “Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.040 Lands to Which This Chapter Applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea as identified by the most recent Flood Insurance Rate Maps provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.050 Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Monterey County, California, and Incorporated Areas,” with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), effective April 2, 2009, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file with the City Clerk. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.060 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.070 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.080 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.090 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.100 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.110 Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.
The City Administrator and/or his/her designated representative is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.120 Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

A. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

1. Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;

2. All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained;

3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea; and

5. All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

C. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with CMC 15.56.050, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer CMC 15.56.150.

Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations,” dated July 1995.

D. Notification of Other Agencies.

1. Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.

a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;

b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

c. Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

2. Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

a. Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

b. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

3. Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

E. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

1. Certification required by CMC 15.56.150(C)(1) and 15.56.180 (lowest floor elevations);

2. Certification required by CMC 15.56.150(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);

3. Certification required by CMC 15.56.150(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard);

4. Certification of elevation required by CMC 15.56.170(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards);

5. Certification required by CMC 15.56.200 (floodway encroachments);

6. Information required by CMC 15.56.210(F) (coastal construction standards); and

7. Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

F. Map Determination. Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in CMC 15.56.140.

G. Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in CMC 15.56.060.

H. Biennial Report. Complete and submit a biennial report to FEMA.

I. Planning. Assure the community’s General Plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.130 Development Permit.
A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development, including manufactured homes, within any area of special flood hazard established in CMC 15.56.050. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea. The applicant shall provide the following minimum information:

A. Plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing:

1. Location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, storage of materials and equipment and their location;

2. Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and other utilities;

3. Grading information showing existing and proposed contours, any proposed fill, and drainage facilities;

4. Location of the regulatory floodway when applicable;

15.56.200 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1 – A30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea.

B. Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

C. If subsections (A) and (B) of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of CMC 15.56.150. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.210 Coastal High Hazard Areas.
Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, V1 – V30, and VE, as established under CMC 15.56.050, the following standards shall apply:

A. All new residential and nonresidential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards.

B. All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.

C. All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in CMC 15.56.020. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

D. Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.

E. Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

F. The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

1. Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (A) of this section; and

2. The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.220 Nature of Variances.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.230 Conditions for Variances.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of CMC 15.56.120, 15.56.130 and 15.56.150 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in CMC 15.56.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County of Monterey Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

F. The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

15.56.240 Appeal Board.
A. In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:

1. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B. Variances shall only be issued upon a:

1. Showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “public safety and nuisance” in CMC 15.56.020), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

C. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections (A) through (D) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of CMC 15.56.230(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1 (Exh. A § 4), 2018).

The City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is hereby determined to be primarily, essentially and predominantly a residential City wherein business and commerce have in the past, are now, and are proposed to be in the future subordinated to its residential character and that said determination is made having in mind the history and the development of said City, its growth and the causes thereof, and also its geographical and topographical aspects, together with its near proximity to the cities of Pacific Grove and Monterey, and the businesses, industries, trades, callings and professions in existence and permissible therein. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.02.020 Title and Authority.
This title of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea Municipal Code shall be known and cited as the “Carmel-by-the-Sea Zoning Ordinance and Coastal Zone Implementation Plan,” or “Zoning Ordinance.” This title is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in Section 65850 et seq. of the California Government Code, Division 20 of the Public Resources Code (California Coastal Act), and Title 14, Division 5.5 of the California Code of Regulations (California Coastal Commission Regulations). (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.02.030 Purpose.
The purpose of this title is to protect and promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare and to implement the policies of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan. More specifically, this title is intended to:

A. Provide a precise guide for the physical development of the City in order to preserve the residential village character of the City and perpetuate a balance of land uses that are compatible with local resources and the environment;

B. Conserve and enhance the City’s architectural, historical, cultural and natural resources, including the scenic quality of Carmel as a coastal community; and

C. Preserve the traditional characteristics of scale, site design and sensitivity to neighboring sites in all districts; encourage construction that is diverse and innovative in design yet compatible with Carmel’s forest setting and natural environment. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Any governmental agency shall be exempt from the provisions of this title only to the extent that such property may not be lawfully regulated by the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea.

B. Compliance with Regulations.

1. It shall be unlawful for any building or structure to be moved, erected, used, altered, enlarged, or rebuilt or for any use to be established or changed that does not strictly conform to the provisions of this title.

2. It shall be unlawful for any yard, open space, or land to be used for any purpose or in any way not specifically permitted by this title.

3. No department, official, or employee of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses for buildings, structures, or uses subject to the requirements of this title shall issue a permit or license in conflict with the provisions of this title; any permit or license issued in conflict with any provision of this title shall be null and void. Further, no permit or license shall be issued by any department, official, or employee of the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea for any building, structure, or use subject to the requirements of this title on a parcel of land where the department official or employee is aware that a violation of this title exists.

C. Public Nuisance. Neither the provisions of this title nor the approval of any permit required by this title shall authorize any public nuisance to be maintained on any property.

D. Compliance with Public Notice Requirements. Compliance with public notice requirements prescribed by this title or by California statutes shall be deemed sufficient notice to allow the City to proceed with a public hearing and take action on an application, regardless of actual receipt of mailed or delivered notice.

E. Requests for Notice. Where this chapter requires that notice be given by first class mail to “any person who has filed a written request for such notice,” the request shall be filed with the Director.

F. Conflict with Other Regulations. Where conflict occurs between the provisions of this title and any other City code, chapter, resolution, guideline, or regulation, the more restrictive provision shall control unless otherwise specified.

However, no provision of this title shall validate or legalize any use or structure established, constructed, or maintained in violation of the prior zoning ordinance, as amended, unless specifically authorized by this title.

H. Time of Approval. All approvals granted pursuant to the provisions of this title by the Director, Historic Resources Board, Planning Commission, or City Council are effective upon the granting of the permit or approval or after any time – which may be allowed by law for appeal of the permit, approval, or other action – has been completed. Where good reason exists, the effective time of approval may be modified by the permit or approval.

17.02.060 Consistency with the General Plan and the Coastal Land Use Plan.
A. An application for any permit, license, or approval submitted pursuant to this title shall not be accepted as complete for processing unless it is consistent with the land use designation described in the General Plan and the Coastal Land Use Plan. However, the concurrent filing of a permit or license with a General Plan/Land Use Plan amendment application and/or an amendment to the Zoning Code/Implementation Plan shall be allowed. In such cases, the permit or license application(s) shall be considered incomplete for purposes of implementing the Permit Streamlining Act until final action has been taken on the amendment(s) to the General Plan/Land Use Plan/Zoning Ordinance/Implementation Plan. In any case, where there is a conflict between this title and the General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan, the General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan shall prevail.

In the event that adjoining City property is not yet at official grade when a building permit is issued, access will be allowed at other than official grade. Any deviation from official grade shall be constructed so that the property owner can readily alter the access to meet official grade without cost or damage to the City and without a major alteration to the structures on private property at the time the street or sidewalk are brought to official grade; and

6. To dispose of, clean from tools, or store, any solvents, paint, plaster, adhesives, tar, concrete, or other hazardous material in a way that results in the above mentioned material coming into contact with soil anywhere in the City or being disposed of anywhere but in a legal disposal site.

In the event of a conflict between the regulations of this title and the General Plan/Land Use Plan, the latter shall take precedence.

B. In no case shall the time limit for action required by this title for any approving body exceed time limits as set forth in Government Code Section 65920 et seq., otherwise known as the Permit Streamlining Act.

C. To the extent that this title quotes or paraphrases any State or Federal Statute for convenience and any conflict is discovered, or is created through amendment, the State or Federal Statute shall control and shall be cause for an amendment to this title. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

(Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.02.110 Severability.

17.04.010 Purpose.
The public health, safety, welfare, convenience and comfort in the City require that the use of private property be regulated and that districts and zones be established throughout the City, within some of which it is lawful and in others unlawful to erect, alter, or maintain certain buildings, or to make certain uses of property, and in all of which certain uses shall be prohibited. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.04.020 Districts Established.
Every part of the City is classified into districts or zones, the designation and the regulations of which are set forth in this title. Unless otherwise shown on the official zoning map, zoning boundaries that follow a street shall run along the street centerline. In case any of the streets or alleys have been or are hereafter vacated or abandoned, the land embraced in such abandoned area shall take the district classification of the property to which it reverts. For each of such districts there are imposed certain regulations and limitations on the uses of land, the use, height and bulk of buildings and the open spaces around buildings. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.04.030 Residential Districts Established.
The residential area is divided into two land use districts for the purpose of providing an appropriate geographic distribution of land uses of varying intensity and community impact. The primary goal of these districts is to preserve and protect the predominantly residential character of the City by providing a balanced mix of residential densities in accordance with the General Plan/Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan. This goal is to be achieved by:

A. Locating higher density residential uses in proximity to the village center and lower density residential uses outside of the commercial area;

B. Providing distinctly different design standards appropriate to the low-density residential uses in noncommercial areas and the higher density residential uses near the village center;

C. Encouraging residential uses in close proximity to park and open space resources; and

D. Providing for existing nonresidential uses such as churches, schools, nonprofit organizations and other quasi-public uses on existing sites.

Residential districts are established and designated as follows:

17.04.040 Commercial Districts Established.
The commercial area is divided into three land use districts for the purpose of providing an appropriate geographic distribution of land uses of varying intensity and community impact. The primary goal of these districts is to preserve and protect the predominantly residential character of the City by providing a balanced mix of commercial and residential uses in accordance with the General Plan. This goal is to be achieved by:

A. Locating intense commercial activities in the core of the commercial area;

B. Providing a transition from intense uses in the commercial core to less intense uses in the residential districts;

C. Controlling the number, type and distribution of similar uses among the different districts;

D. Encouraging a mix of commercial, residential and community activities throughout the commercial area; and

E. Excluding those commercial activities which conflict with the protection of the City’s residential character and unique village atmosphere, and which can be and are provided outside the City but within the region.

H. “Director” means the Community Planning and Building Director or the Director’s designee. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.06.020 Rules of Measurement.
A. Purpose. This section explains how various measurements referenced in this title are to be calculated.

B. General Provisions.

1. Applicant Responsibility. For all calculations, the applicant shall be responsible for supplying drawings illustrating the measurements. These drawings shall be drawn to scale and shall be of sufficient detail to allow easy verification upon inspection by the Director.

2. Fractions. When calculations result in fractions, the results will be rounded as follows:

a. Minimum Requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any fractional result will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For example, if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 30 lineal feet is applied to a 50-foot strip, the resulting fraction of 1.37 is rounded up to two required trees.

b. Maximum Limits. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole number. For example, if a maximum floor area limit for guesthouse is applied to a 7,500-square-foot lot, the resulting number of 422.5 is rounded down to 422 allowed square feet.

3. Measuring Distances. Distances shall be measured as follows:

a. Distances Are Measured Horizontally. When determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area, or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography or slope of the land.

b. Measurements Are Shortest Distance. When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two objects. Exceptions are stated in subsection (B)(3)(c) of this section.

c. Measurement of Vehicle Stacking or Travel Areas. The minimum travel distance for vehicles, such as a garage-entrance setback, is measured down the center of the vehicle travel area. For example, curving driveways are measured along the center arc of the driveway.

C. Required Area for a Building Site.

1. Existing Buildings. The ground area needed for legal construction of a building at the time of construction shall be one building site. If the building could not be legally built on the same ground area at the present time, the building site shall be called a nonconforming building site.

2. Vacant Land. The land area required by the standards in the base zoning districts shall be a legal building site if the land area is a legal lot of record or if the land area was legally reconfigured in conformance with the Subdivision Map Act of the State and the provisions for subdivision or lot line adjustments established in Chapter 17.44 CMC, Subdivisions and Lot Line Adjustments.

3. Multiple Lots on One Building Site. The ground area of a building site may be comprised of more than one lot. The ground area of more than one lot may be required by existing or proposed buildings on a site pursuant to CMC 17.10.020(B). Each building site must retain a ground area and setbacks consistent with all provisions of this code. Each building site must be composed of original lots of record or composed of new lots legally reconfigured from original lots in conformance with the Subdivision Map Act of the State and the provisions for subdivision or lot line adjustments established in the municipal code.

D. Determining Buildable Area. For the purposes of calculating allowable building volume and floor area, the buildable area of a lot shall be the lot area, minus the following:

1. Continuous portions of the site, occupying at least 10 percent of the site area, with a slope greater than 30 percent (e.g., see steep slope areas in Figure I-2).

2. The “pole” of a flag lot;

3. Private access roads;

4. Those portions of a site qualifying as Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas (ESHA) as provided for in Article V of Chapter 17.20 CMC, Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area Overlay District; and

5. Scenic, habitat, coastal access or conservation easements.

Figure I-2: Buildable Area

E. Average Slope.

1. Average Slope. The average slope of a lot is calculated by subtracting the average elevation of the uphill lot line and the average elevation of the downhill lot line and dividing the sum by the average distance between the two lot lines. The average elevation of the uphill or downhill lot line is calculated by adding the elevations at the ends of the lot line and dividing by two.

2. Average Percent of Slope. The ratio between vertical and horizontal distances expressed in percent, the mathematical expression of which is based upon the formula below:

Vertical Distance

X

100 = Average Percent Slope

Horizontal Distance

Figure I-3: Average Slope

F. Grades. “Existing grade” is the set of elevations representing the surface of the ground prior to grading, filling, or other site alterations for a project. On developed sites, as each topographic line passes beneath a building it shall be assumed to be a straight and level line for purposes of defining existing grade. Existing grade may also be referred to as natural grade (See Figure I-4).

On sites disturbed from previous grading or excavation activities, an approximation of preexisting conditions may be used as a reference for determining average or existing grade using grades on adjacent sites, retaining walls and prior survey maps. All such grade approximations shall require the concurrence of the Department and a determination that the resulting project complies with all requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, avoids large exposed cuts and unnatural topography and is consistent with R-1 design objectives.

“Average grade” is a horizontal line approximating the ground elevation through each building on a site, used for calculating the exterior volumes of buildings. Average grade is calculated separately for each building. Average grade is calculated in four steps:

1. Plot the ground level perimeter of the building on a topographic map of the site using one-foot contour intervals. Assign an elevation of “zero” for the lowest contour line that passes through the building perimeter.

2. For each contour line that intersects the building perimeter, draw a straight line through the building that connects the point of intersection to where the same contour line emerges from the building perimeter (see Figure I-4, below).

3. For each line drawn in Step 2, multiply its length by its elevation (above the “zero” contour line) and then sum all results.

4. Divide the sum from Step 3 by the sum of the lengths of all lines drawn. The resulting elevation above the “zero” contour line is extended as a horizontal line through the building as average grade.

Figure I-4: Existing Grade

G. Exterior Volume. The maximum allowable exterior volume is calculated by multiplying a volume factor in CMC 17.10.030(C) by the allowed base floor area, subject to the following:

1. Exterior volume is expressed in cubic feet and is measured from the exterior wall and roof surfaces of each building. The exterior volume of the building shall be based on the height of the exterior walls above both the average existing grade and the average final grade. Where the average grade line lies below a building, the exterior walls of the building are projected down to average grade to calculate its volume. Portions of a building located below average grade are excluded from exterior volume.

2. Exterior volume includes all dwellings, guesthouses, accessory dwelling units, garages, carports, chimneys, storage sheds, projecting windows and covered porches.

3. Exterior volume also includes the volumes in and under any attached or freestanding arbor or trellis and under that portion of any roof eave extending more than 18 inches from the face of any building.

4. Decks or balconies with a walking surface more than three feet above final grade shall count as exterior volume as measured from the deck surface to the top of any rail or enclosing wall. Any deck or balcony with a floor level less than three feet above final grade will be excluded from the volume total.

Figure I-5: Determining Exterior Volume

H. Determining Base Floor Area. The maximum allowable base floor area shall be calculated by multiplying the buildable area of the lot by the maximum percentage presented in the development standards for each zone.

I. Determining Floor Area Ratio. The floor area ratio shall be expressed as percentage of the buildable area of the parcel of land upon which the building rests. For above-ground spaces, floor area is measured at the exterior of the enclosing walls. For basement spaces, floor area is measured at the interior of the enclosing walls.

J. Resubdivided Corner Lots. Resubdivided corner lots are those created through a lot line adjustment by reorienting a lot line 90 degrees running between two adjacent original lots of record, one of which is located at the corner of a block and the other is adjacent to the corner lot and fronting on the same street. Each lot created by this action is considered a resubdivided corner lot for purposes of establishing front setbacks.

K. Determining Lot Coverage. The total ground area of a lot occupied by materials or improvements that cover the natural soil but which are outside the perimeter of structures that count as floor area. Lot coverage includes:

1. Fully permeable materials including gravel, spaced decking and exterior stairs. However, shredded bark, wood chips and similar materials used as mulch within fully landscaped areas are not counted as lot coverage;

2. Semi-permeable materials including sand-set bricks or pavers, garden walkways of small paving stones, and arbors; and

3. Impermeable materials including asphalt, concrete, decomposed granite, mortared brick and stone, unspaced decking and balconies at any level, garden walls, solariums, bridges, sheds not counted as floor area, ponds, hot tubs and swimming pools.

L. Measuring Height.

1. Measuring Building Height. The height of buildings shall be measured as the plumb vertical distance from existing or finished grade (whichever is more restrictive) to the highest point on the roof.

a. Flat Roof. The measurement is made to the highest point of the roof beams of the roof.

b. Mansard Roof. The measurement is made to the deck line of the roof.

c. Pitched or Hipped Roof. The measurement is made to the peak or gable of the roof.

Figure I-6: Measuring Building Height

2. Measuring Height of Other Structures. The height of other structures, such as fences, is the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to the top of a structure. Special measurement provisions are also provided below.

a. Retaining Walls and Fences. Retaining walls and fences on top of retaining walls are measured from the ground level on the lower side of the retaining wall.

Figure I-7: Retaining Walls and Fences

b. Decks. Deck height is determined by measuring from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck.

M. Measuring Lot Widths and Depths.

1. Lot Depth. The horizontal distance from the midpoint of the front lot line to the midpoint of the rear lot line or to the most distant point on any other lot line where there is no rear lot line.

2. Lot Width. The average horizontal distance between the side lot lines measured at right angles to the lot depth from the required front yard setback and from the required rear yard setback or from the rearmost point of the lot depth in cases where there is no rear lot line. The width of a nonrectangular lot shall be the mean length of the front and rear property lines.

N. Measuring Setbacks.

1. Front Setbacks. Front setbacks shall be measured from the property line adjacent to the street fronting the property. On corner lots with two street frontages, the shortest frontage shall be considered the front, regardless of where the driveway or front entry is located. See subsection (N)(5) of this section for flag lot exceptions.

2. Rear Setbacks. Rear setbacks shall be measured from the property line most directly opposite the front. See subsection (N)(5) of this section for flag lot exceptions.

3. Side Setbacks. Side setbacks shall be measured from the property lines not defined as front or rear.

4. Composite Side Setbacks. Composite side setbacks shall be calculated as the sum of both side setbacks. When calculating a composite side setback, any combination of the side setbacks may be used (for example a 10-foot composite side setback could be composed of five feet on both sides or three feet on one side and seven feet on the other). Different combinations may be used at different places on the site to allow for different building shapes. Composite side setbacks shall be measured along lines parallel to the front property line. On a flag lot the setback is measured along lines parallel to that line of the “flag” portion of the lot closest to the street.

5. Flag Lots. For flag lots, the front setback applies only to the first 15 feet of the “pole” near the street. All other setbacks apply to the “flag” portion. The “flag” portion will have two “rear” setbacks – one near (and perpendicular to) the pole and the other opposite to this. Setbacks on flag lots shall be measured by excluding the access strip or easement using only the bulk of the lot.

O. Measuring Sign Area. In computing the maximum permissible sign area or display surface, standard mathematical formulas for known or common shapes will be used. Brackets or other appurtenances incorporating design elements that are descriptive or informative of the business use shall be included as part of the sign area.

1. Multi-Faced Signs. All faces of a multi-faced sign shall be included in the calculation of area except for a double-faced hanging or monument sign, in which case only one face shall be included.

2. Irregularly Shaped Sign. The sign area shall include the smallest rectangle that wholly contains the sign. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2, 2017; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.06.030 Rules for Interpretation.
A. Zoning Text. In the implementation of this title, the Director shall determine the intent of all provisions. The determination of the Director may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals.

B. Zoning Map. The following rules shall apply to zoning boundary determinations:

1. District boundaries shown as approximately following the property line of a lot shall be construed to follow such property line.

2. Where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of the district boundary shall be determined by using the scale appearing on the zoning map or by the Director or the Planning Commission. This rule shall not apply to the AS overlay district.

3. Where the AS overlay boundary divides a building site, the entire building site shall be treated as within the overlay district.

4. District boundaries shown as approximately following right-of-way lines of streets or other identifiable boundary lines shall be construed to follow such right-of-way or boundary lines.

5. District boundaries shown as lying within right-of-way lines of streets, or other identifiable boundary lines shall be construed to follow the centerline of such right-of-way or boundary lines.

6. District boundaries shown as lying at the edge of a body of water shall be construed to follow the adopted 100-year floodplain identified for the watercourse.

C. Record of Interpretation. The Director shall keep a record of interpretations made pursuant to this section that shall be available to the public. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.08.040 Land Use Regulations.
Schedule II-1 prescribes the land use regulations for the residential districts. The regulations for each district are established by letter designations as follows:

“P” designates permitted use classifications.

“L” designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain specific limitations noted by the number designations and listed at the end of Schedule II-1.

“C” designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning Commission. Conditions or standards may apply to these uses, noted by the number designations and listed at the end of Schedule II-1.

These uses are subject to Division I, General Regulations, and additional use regulations found in Division IV, Provisions Applying in All or Several Districts. Additional use regulations are also found in CMC 17.08.050, Additional Use Regulations, and are referenced in the schedule. Findings for specific uses may also be required and are found in Chapter 17.64 CMC, Findings Required for Permits and Approvals.

Use classifications are defined in Chapter 17.68 CMC, Use Classifications, and are based on the use classifications listed in the current edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Questions as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use in a particular category will be determined by the Director based on a NAICS Use Categories List, adopted by resolution by the City Council and held at the Department of Community Planning and Building counter. The Director shall make the decision according to the characteristics of the use, and upon the Director’s interpretation of the land use code, the NAICS Use Categories List and the current edition of the NAICS. The determination by the Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission by anyone aggrieved by the decision following the procedures specified in Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals.

17.10.010 Purpose and Design Objectives.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards and requirements for physical development in the R-1 single-family residential district. To implement the General Plan and the Coastal Land Use Plan, the following design objectives for the R-1 district are established.

A. The Urban Forest. Site improvements and the public right-of-way should be designed to preserve significant trees and to perpetuate the established urban forest in each neighborhood where it exists. Each site should contribute to the urban forest or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood, by harboring an appropriate number and mix of trees and/or shrubs consistent with the neighborhood context and the neighborhood streetscape.

B. Neighborhood Design. Each site shall contribute to neighborhood character including the type of forest resources present, the character of the street, the response to local topography and the treatment of open space resources such as setbacks and landscaping. It is intended by this objective that diversity in architecture be encouraged while preserving the broader elements of community design that characterize the streetscape within each neighborhood.

C. Site Design. Good site design is essential to good building design. Site improvements shall be compatible with, and sensitive to, the natural features and built environment of the site and of the surrounding area. Design solutions should relate to and take advantage of site topography, vegetation and slope. Designs shall recognize the limitations of the land and work with these limitations, rather than ignoring them or trying to override them.

D. Mass and Bulk. Residential designs shall maintain Carmel’s enduring principles of modesty and simplicity and preserve the City’s tradition of simple homes set amidst a forest landscape. Buildings shall not present excess visual mass or bulk to public view or to adjoining properties. Large box-like buildings and buildings with large, continuous, unrelieved surfaces can appear massive. Designing building and roof planes with just a few, simple forms and keeping floor levels and plate heights close to grade help reduce mass and bulk. The use of natural materials such as wood or stone and the creative use of landscaping can also help to avoid excess mass by introducing texture, variety and screening.

E. Scale. Buildings shall relate to a human scale in their forms, elements and in the detailing of doors, windows, roofs and walkways. Oversized design elements make structures appear dominating and monumental. This out-of-scale character represents a poor fit to the human form, vitiates the more intimate, rural charm and village character of Carmel-by-the-Sea and shall be avoided.

F. Boxed-in Neighbors. Designs should preserve reasonable access to light, air and open space for surrounding properties when considered cumulatively with other buildings in the neighborhood. Designs incorporating tall or bulky building elements located near an adjoining site that is already partially boxed-in by previous development should be avoided.

G. Privacy. Designs should respect the privacy of neighbors. The placement of windows, doors, balconies and decks should be sensitive to similar improvements on neighboring properties.

H. Open Space. The design of structures shall be coordinated with open space to enhance the park-like environment of the City. Open space should be distributed around buildings to provide visual relief from structural bulk and a distinct separation from buildings on adjacent sites. Open space is a shared community resource and some front yard open space on each site should remain visible from the street when this is consistent with the context established by neighboring sites.

I. Landscaping. Designs should coordinate structural elements with landscaping to achieve a pleasing overall site design. Landscaped open space on-site can help enhance the urban forest, or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood, by coordinating with open space on neighboring sites and roadside vegetation. Landscaping also can aid in achieving other design objectives such as breaking up mass and bulk and protecting privacy, but such use of landscaping should not substitute for good building design.

J. Public Views. Buildings shall be located and designed to preserve significant coastal views from the public right-of-way in conformance with Section 30251 of the California Coastal Act. The protection of public views should not prevent reasonable development of the site, yet development shall not preclude reasonable protection of any significant coastal view.

K. Private Views. Designs should respect views enjoyed by neighboring parcels. This objective is intended to balance the private rights to views from all parcels that will be affected by a proposed building or addition. No single parcel should enjoy a greater right than other parcels except the natural advantages of each site’s topography. Buildings which substantially eliminate an existing significant view enjoyed on another parcel should be avoided.

L. Solar Access. Designs should preserve the rights to reasonable solar access on neighboring parcels. Excessively tall buildings, particularly those near a north property line, which would block the free passage of the sun onto neighboring solar collectors or south-facing windows on neighboring sites, should be avoided.

M. Equity. Design controls and conditions of approval should be reasonable and fair. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.10.020 Dimensional Standards – Lots, Parcels and Building Sites.
A. Legal Building Site Required. Parcels not meeting the criteria for legal building sites shall not be issued any building permits, other than permits for demolition, repair or maintenance, until the parcel has been brought into compliance with this section. A parcel of land within the R-1 land use district shall meet one of the following standards to be considered a legal building site:

1. At Least 2,500 Square Feet. A single, independent lot of record in existence on February 4, 1948, with at least 2,500 square feet of land area that was not in the same ownership as one or more adjoining lots of record on that date; or

2. Two Thousand Five Hundred Square Feet or More. Any lot of record of 2,500 square feet or more, that on February 4, 1948, was in the same ownership as one or more adjoining lots of record and qualifies under one of the criteria below:

a. A parcel of land in the form of a rectangle having at least 3,700 square feet, composed of 2,500-square-foot lots of record and/or portions thereof that existed on February 4, 1948, and which have been reconfigured either by a lot line adjustment or by a merger of lots in conformance with CMC 17.10.040, Lot Mergers.

b. A parcel of land in the form of a rectangle having at least 5,000 square feet, composed of two or more whole 2,500-square-foot lots of record that existed on February 4, 1948, and which has been formed by a merger of lots in conformance with CMC 17.10.040, Lot Mergers.

3. At Least 4,000 Square Feet. A parcel of land having at least 4,000 square feet in area that is composed of one or more whole lots of record, or was composed of portions of lots of record but has been reconfigured through a lot line adjustment, or by a merger of lots, and recorded as one or more whole lot of record.

4. At Least 6,000 Square Feet. A parcel of land having an area of not less than 6,000 square feet which is not in the form of a rectangle conforming to the standards below:

a. All irregularly shaped lots must contain a minimum 20-foot frontage on a public right-of-way, except for parcels of land abutting a public street which shall have a minimum frontage of 40 feet, and except for parcels of land abutting a public cul-de-sac, which shall have a minimum frontage of 30 feet.

b. Any right-of-way used for ingress and egress to buildable portions of irregularly shaped lots shall be unobstructed and shall have a minimum width of 20 feet, and the 20-foot right-of-way shall not be considered for purposes of building site area or building site coverage.

5. Multiple Lots on One Building Site. No developed building site composed of more than one lot of record shall be reduced in size by establishing one of the component lots as a separate site if such action would create or increase nonconformity with respect to the allowable site coverage, floor area ratio, parking, setbacks, site area or other zoning standards for any site involved.

B. Fragment Lots. Lot fragments are portions of lots that do not meet minimum standards for building site area. Some existing parcels and building sites contain one or more lot fragments resulting from past activities such as:

1. Lot line adjustments or subdivisions in which preexisting lot lines, interior to the property, were not removed;

2. Private transactions involving land transfers between parties as in gifts, exchanges, deed transfers, inheritance, etc., which also left lot lines, interior to the property intact; or

3. Designated remainders not divided for the purpose of sale, lease, or financing that were not counted as a parcel for the purpose of fulfillment of requirements for subdivision improvements.

Lot fragments shall not qualify as legal building sites unless joined to whole lots or other fragments to meet minimum building site criteria for size, as established above in this section and recorded as one or more lots of record.

C. Steep Slope Areas. For areas with an average slope greater than 30 percent, the minimum lot size required for new subdivisions shall increase by the following percentages:

1. Slopes Between 30 and 40 Percent. The minimum lot size requirements shall increase by 50 percent.

2. Slopes Between 40 and 50 Percent. The minimum lot size requirements shall increase by 75 percent.

3. Slopes Greater than 50 Percent. The minimum lot size requirements shall increase by 100 percent.

D. Certificates of Compliance. Any person owning real property or vendee pursuant to a contract of sale of real property may request, and a local agency shall determine, whether the real property complies with all applicable City ordinances and the Subdivision Map Act regarding the formation of legal lots. Upon finding that a parcel complies with the requirements for a legal lot under the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances adopted pursuant to formation of legal lots, the Department of Community Planning and Building shall issue for recordation a certificate of compliance. If the Department determines that the property does not comply with applicable State and City requirements, the Director may impose any conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest. Upon making a determination of noncompliance and establishing conditions, the City shall cause a conditional certificate of compliance to be filed for recordation with the County Recorder. In addition, the lot configuration described in the conditional certificate of compliance shall be subject to the coastal development permit requirements of Chapter 17.52 CMC. Furthermore, any lot configuration described in a [unconditional] certificate of compliance shall be subject to the coastal development permit requirements of the Local Coastal Program (Chapter 17.52 CMC) if the division of land that created that configuration occurred subsequent to January 1, 1977, or February 1, 1973, in the case of a division subject to Proposition 20. Compliance with these conditions shall be required prior to City action on any permit for development of the parcel except as otherwise provided in this section. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Figure II-1: Rear Setback Exception

1. Detached Garages and Carports. To encourage variety and diversity in neighborhood design, detached garages and carports may be authorized by the Planning Commission within rear yard setbacks or front or side yard setbacks facing a street, subject to the following standards:

a. Front or Side Yard Setback Facing a Street. The Planning Commission may authorize a single-car, detached garage or carport not exceeding 12 feet in width, 250 square feet in floor area and 15 feet in height in either the front yard setback or a side yard setback facing a street (but not both) if:

i. At least 50 percent of the adjacent right-of-way is landscaped or preserved in a natural and forested condition to compensate for the loss of open space;

ii. The proposed setback encroachment would not impact significant or moderately significant trees;

iii. Free and safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles in adjacent rights-of-way is protected;

iv. All development on site will be in scale with adjacent properties and the neighborhood context consistent with adopted design guidelines; and

v. Placement of the garage or carport in the setback will add diversity to the neighborhood streetscape.

b. Interior Side Yard Setback and/or Rear Setback. Detached garages may encroach into an interior side yard setback, rear yard setbacks, or both, if limited to 15 feet in height, the setback encroachment would not impact significant or moderately significant trees, and the garage location/design complies with design guidelines.

Figure II-3: Maximum Heights

1. Chimneys. Fireplace chimneys and vents, including caps, shall be no higher than required by the UBC and shall not exceed four feet in height above the building height. Chimneys, vents or chimney enclosures which project above a roofline, flat deck or parapet wall shall also be subject to the following standards.

a. Maximum horizontal dimension: three feet and four inches. No cap or ornament shall exceed 24 inches in any horizontal dimension.

i. Exception: three feet and six inches for double-flue chimneys.

b. Chimneys shall not contain any storage space, access openings or other uses unrelated to the vent function of the chimney.

C. Site Coverage. Impermeable site coverage, as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC, shall be limited to a maximum of 22 percent of the base floor area allowed for the site (Note: on a 4,000 square-foot site this equals 396 square feet or 10 percent of the site).

1. Exemptions.

a. Building Projections. Structural elements that project out from building walls including oriel windows, eaves, balconies, overhangs and similar structural elements are exempt from site coverage calculations if limited to a projection of 18 inches or less. Window wells providing emergency egress shall provide at least three feet of clearance from the window opening and nine square feet in area unless otherwise determined by the Building Official. The ground area of each window well shall be fully counted as site coverage.

Figure II-4: Window Well

b. Additional Site Coverage for Driveways. If at least 50 percent of all site coverage on the property is made of permeable or semi-permeable materials, an additional amount of site coverage of up to four percent of the site area may be allowed for use in a single driveway of up to nine feet in width.

c. Flag Lots. The paving of private roads or the paving on the “pole” of a flag lot are exempt from site coverage limits.

2. Nonconforming Site Coverage. Sites not in compliance with site coverage limits shall not be authorized to increase site coverage. Sites with excess coverage may add floor area consistent with subsection (D)(3) of this section, Exterior Volume, only when:

a. The site complies with the R-1 district tree density provisions established in CMC 17.48.080(A) and all existing and new trees have sufficient space to protect the root zones and provide for new growth; and

b. Excess site coverage will be reduced at a rate equal to two times the amount of floor area added to the site, or to an amount that complies with the site coverage limits, whichever is less.

Figure II-5: Maximum Site Coverage

D. Floor Area Ratio and Exterior Volume.

1. Floor Area. “Floor area” means the total gross square footage included within the surrounding exterior walls of all floors contained within all enclosed buildings on a building site whether finished or unfinished. In above-ground spaces, floor area is measured at the exterior of the enclosing walls. In basement spaces, floor area is measured at the interior of the enclosing walls. Floor area shall include, but shall not be limited to, all floors of all enclosed spaces within all building, basements, mezzanines, guesthouses, studios, garages and carports. All attic, basement and storage shed spaces with five or more feet of clearance between the floor or walking surface and the ceiling or roof surface shall be counted as floor area. All required parking shall be counted as floor area, whether supplied by garage, carport or other means.

2. Maximum Floor Area. The maximum potential floor area on a site is the sum of the base floor area plus any bonus floor area. The actual floor area that will be permitted on each site is dependent on site constraints and compliance with the design objectives for the R-1 district. The maximum floor area will not be achievable on sites with constraints such as slopes, significant trees, unusual shape or difficult access. For sites with an average slope greater than 30 percent, the maximum allowed base floor area and exterior volume shall be reduced by two percent for each one percent increase in average slope above 30 percent up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent (See CMC 17.06.020(D), Determining Buildable Area).

a. Sites Less Than 4,000 Square Feet. On sites of 4,000 square feet or less in area, the maximum base floor area shall not exceed 45 percent of the area of the building site.

b. Sites Between 4,000 and 10,000 Square Feet. On sites between 4,000 square feet and 10,000 square feet, the base floor area shall be calculated as follows:

c. Sites Larger Than 10,000 Square Feet. For sites larger than 10,000 square feet the base floor area shall be as stated in Table 17.10-D. For building sites of a size between two entries in the table, the base floor area shall be prorated using a straight, arithmetic projection between entries. The maximum allowed floor area on any building site 22,000 square feet or larger shall not exceed 6,000 square feet.

Table 17.10-D lists base floor area for common lot sizes.

*The “maximum total floor area” equals the base floor area plus the bonus floor area. The numbers in this column would require half of the total floor area to be located in a basement.

d. Other Provisions.

i. Required Parking. On each site, a minimum of 200 square feet of base floor area and 2,200 cubic feet of exterior volume shall be reserved for each required parking space whether provided by means of a garage, carport or parking pad. Inability to provide on-site parking shall not authorize more floor area or exterior volume for other purposes in lieu of parking.

ii. Unbuildable Areas. Those portions of a property that are not counted as part of the building site or that are unbuildable (i.e., exclusive easements, private roads, the “pole” of a flag lot, etc.) shall first be deducted from the site lot area when calculating base floor area.

iii. Interior Stairways. Interior stairways connecting a first story with a second story shall be counted as floor area on only one of the two floors the stair connects. This floor area shall be considered two-story for purposes of determining volume.

iv. Bonus Floor Area – Basement Incentive. Each site shall be allowed 100 square feet of floor area, located in a basement that is exempt from the floor area limit established in this section. This basement floor area shall be in addition to the allowed base floor area total.

3. Exterior Volume.

a. General Provisions. The maximum allowable exterior volume is the total allowed base floor area for the site multiplied by the volume factors in Table 17.10-E. (See also CMC 17.06.020 (G), Exterior Volume).

b. Volume Option for Additions. It is recognized that existing homes built prior to 2003 may not have been designed to comply with volume standards. For these homes the following option is available: additions of floor area, whether attached or detached, may be approved through design review without determining compliance with the exterior volume standard for the entire site. Instead, the addition(s) shall comply with the applicable volume factor (from the table above), only for the specific floor area contained in the addition(s). This option applies only to the specific location of the addition. No alteration affecting other parts of the building shall be approved through this option. Projects for which applicants have not chosen this option shall be reviewed using volume limits for the entire site.

c. Changes in Design with Limited Affect on Volume. The Director may waive the requirement for a determination of total exterior volume for any changes in design if the volume being added by all of the proposed changes would not exceed two percent of the total allowed volume for the site. The cumulative total volume of changes constructed after February 6, 2003, using such waivers shall not exceed this two percent limit.

4. Bonus Floor Area. The City provides an incentive to use some of the base floor area and exterior volume in a basement. The result of this incentive is to reduce above-ground floor area and reduce exterior volume for sites awarded bonus floor area in basements. Under this incentive program, the area required for a minimal stairway from the first floor to the basement shall not be counted as floor area on either floor the stair connects.

a. One-Story. For each one square foot of the base floor area constructed in a basement and 12 cubic feet of allowed exterior volume not built above average grade, one additional square foot of bonus floor area may be constructed in a basement.

b. Two-Story. For each one square foot of the base floor area constructed in a basement and 11 cubic feet of allowed exterior volume not built above average grade, one additional square foot of bonus floor area may be constructed in a basement. (See bonus basement floor area as shown in Table 17.10-F).

c. The limits on the amount of volume that may be built in a basement are the defined interior ceiling height for basements and the requirement that all basement space shall be located within the perimeter established by the exterior, above-ground walls of the primary dwelling on the site. A basement shall not extend into any open space or yard area outside the building footprint without it counting as above-ground floor area.

d. On some sites, or areas within a site, excavation may be inappropriate due to tree roots or other constraints and the bonus floor area will not be achievable. Bonus floor area is not available to sites nonconforming with respect to any floor area or parking regulation.

2. Reconstruction of Nonconforming Fences and Walls. Existing fences and walls may be rebuilt if damaged or deteriorated without conforming to current height limits upon submittal of plans and photographs documenting existing heights and materials prior to demolition. The director may approve the rebuilding as long as heights are not increased.

3. New Fences and Walls. New fences and walls on corner lots shall be reviewed by the Building Official in consultation with the Police Department to ensure a safe line of sight for intersecting lanes of traffic.

4. Retaining Walls. Retaining walls in front setbacks or side setbacks facing a street are permitted as follows:

a. Retaining walls with the exposed face visible from the street shall have a maximum height of three feet.

b. Retaining walls with the exposed face parallel to the street and facing the interior of the property site shall have a maximum height of six feet.

c. Exceptions to these height limits shall require Planning Commission approval.

Figure II-5: Retaining Walls

F. On-Site Parking Requirements. Required parking spaces shall be provided by a garage, carport or parking pad measuring at least 10 feet by 20 feet having practical ingress and egress for a vehicle. Tandem parking is allowed in this district. All required parking shall be provided on-site and shall be counted as floor area and exterior volume.

1. Required Parking Spaces.

a. Dwellings. One parking space per primary dwelling on sites of 8,000 square feet or less in area. Two parking spaces per primary dwelling on sites larger than 8,000 square feet in area.

b. Guesthouses. One space per guesthouse.

c. Accessory Dwelling Units. Sites with Class II accessory dwelling units shall provide a minimum of one parking space on-site at the time of approval. Upon enlargement or improvement of a Class II unit there shall be one parking space each for the primary dwelling on the site and for the accessory dwelling unit. Improvements to accessory dwelling units are allowed even if one or both parking spaces encroaches into a setback. Sites with Class III or IV accessory dwelling units shall provide one parking space behind all setbacks for the accessory dwelling unit and shall comply with all parking requirements established in Chapter 17.38 CMC, Off-Street Parking Requirements, for other development on the site.

2. Additional Requirements.

a. Parking required for conditional uses shall be established when the use permit is issued, but shall be no less than for equivalent uses in the commercial district;

b. Each required parking space shall conform to setback standards unless an exception or variance applies. Driveways may encroach into setbacks;

c. On sites of less than 6,000 square feet, only a single-car width garage door shall face the street. Wider garage doors on such lots may be authorized if the door is integrated into the house and adjacent wall surfaces (i.e., same materials and color) or set back at least 50 percent into the depth of the lot;

d. Developed building sites not meeting parking standards shall be considered nonconforming. No building permits authorizing any demolition, floor area addition or increase in exterior volume exceeding two percent of allowed volume shall be issued unless one or more of the following applies:

i. The proposed plans for construction will achieve compliance with all parking standards; or

ii. The building permit is for repairs only, or is for alterations involving no expansion of floor area and the valuation of the work would not exceed 25 percent of current construction costs for replacement of the building.

G. Outdoor Antennas. Except as provided in Chapter 17.46 CMC, Telecommunications and Wireless Facilities, all outdoor antennas, including satellite dishes, shall conform to the following:

1. Maximum Number. One antenna per building site.

2. Maximum Height. No part of any antenna shall exceed the height limits in the underlying land use district or overlay zone. Roof-mounted antennas serving a single property are allowed if they are mounted below the ridgeline and are not visible from any street.

3. Minimum Setbacks. Ground-mounted antennas and support structures shall be at least three feet from any property line. No antennas or support structure shall be located in any setback facing a street.

4. Screening. All ground- or wall-mounted antennas shall be screened or camouflaged by walls, color, fences or landscaping. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2, 2017; amended during 8/09 update; Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.10.040 Lot Mergers.
A. Mergers Initiated by the City. As provided for in the Subdivision Map Act of the State of California, the City may merge two or more contiguous parcels or units of land that are under the same ownership if any one of the parcels or units does not conform to the building site standards contained in this chapter and all of the following requirements are met:

1. At least one of the parcels is undeveloped by any structure, or is developed only with one or more accessory structures, or is developed with a single structure other than an accessory structure that is also partially sited on a contiguous parcel or unit.

2. With respect to any affected parcel or unit, one or more of the following conditions exist. The parcel or unit:

a. Is comprised of less than 5,000 square feet in area at the time of the determination of merger; or

b. Was not created in compliance with the applicable laws and ordinances in effect at the time of its creation; or

c. Does not meet standards for water supply (See Chapter 17.50 CMC, Water Management Program); or

d. Has a slope in excess of 30 percent; or

e. Has no legal access adequate for vehicular and safety equipment access and maneuverability; or

f. If developed would create health or safety hazards; or

g. Is inconsistent with the General Plan Coastal Land Use Plan, or any applicable specific plan, other than minimum lot size or density standards.

3. Regulatory Merger Procedure. The procedures for mergers shall follow the requirements established in the Subdivision Map Act of the State of California at the time of the merger.

B. Mergers Requested by Property Owners.

1. Merger of Substandard Lots and/or Lot Fragments. A property owner may request a merger to consolidate lots and/or lot fragments as defined by this code to create a single parcel that meets the requirements for a legal building site in the district where the property is located. Such request shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by such information as required by the Director and a fee established by the City Council. The Director may approve a request for merger without public notice or a hearing. Approvals shall be subject to conditions necessary to achieve compliance with the General Plan and other applicable regulations. The Director’s decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission as provided for in Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals, and the Subdivision Map Act. Upon approval, the City shall cause to be filed a determination of merger with the County Recorder.

2. Other Owner-Initiated Mergers. The City encourages the merger of small lots into larger lots to promote diversity in design and housing size and to preserve open space. Two or more contiguous lots of record, each of which would individually meet the standards for development as a building site, may be merged through the filing of a voluntary merger request by the owner(s). Upon approval of such a merger by the Department of Community Planning and Building, and recording of merger documents or maps with the County Recorder, the following incentives become available to the property:

a. Allowed base floor area may be increased by three percent of site area, beyond the standard specified in CMC 17.10.030(D), Floor Area Ratio and Exterior Volume. A commensurate amount of additional exterior volume also shall be allowed.

b. Guesthouses or accessory dwelling units may be built with 100 square feet more floor area than is specified in CMC 17.08.050(C), Guesthouses and 17.08.050(G), Accessory Dwelling Units.

c. Up to 2.5 percent of additional site coverage is allowed if the site complies with the City’s tree density standards.

d. One additional accessory structure is allowed for a total of three accessory structures on the site.

C. Voluntary Waiver of Subdivision Rights. Any owner of a lot of record that is two or more times the minimum lot size for the underlying land use district may grant a permanent easement to the City, voluntarily waiving all future rights to apply for, and receive approval for, any subdivision of land to create additional building sites. Upon approval by the Department of Community Planning and Building and proper recording of easement documents with the County Recorder, the incentives established in this section for merged lots become available to the property. (Ord. 2017-10 § 2, 2017; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

A. Parcels shown on Plate 2 of Floodplain Information, Carmel River, Monterey County, California (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District, May 1967), are considered to be in a floodplain.

B. Any new building or addition to an existing building located in a floodplain shall establish the first floor level at least one foot higher than the elevation of the standard project flood, or in the case of nonresidential structures, the elevation to which the building has been flood protected. Documentation verifying compliance shall be certified by a civil engineer registered in the State and shall accompany the building permit for the proposed construction. All elevations shown on the plans shall be referenced to mean sea level. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.10.060 Residential Design Guidelines.
The City Council shall maintain design guidelines to implement the design objectives outlined in CMC 17.10.010, Purpose and Design Objectives. The Planning Commission and the Department of Community Planning and Building shall use these Guidelines to review proposed construction. Designs that conflict with municipal code standards or which fail to achieve reasonable compliance with the adopted R-1 design objectives shall not be approved. (Amended during 8/09 update; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.10.070 Review of Plans.
All proposed site development, exterior alterations, rebuilding, rehabilitation and new construction shall require design review. The dimensional standards established in this chapter (e.g., height, setbacks, coverage, floor area) represent maximum or minimum limits and will not be achievable on every site. Design review involves discretion and judgment regarding the appropriateness of each design within the context of site constraints and neighborhood character. See Chapter 17.58 CMC, Design Review. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.10.080 Additional Use Regulations.
Development, as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC, shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea by eliminating free public beach parking along San Antonio Avenue between 2nd Avenue and Santa Lucia or along any street rights-of-way west of San Antonio. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.010 Purpose.
The specific purposes of the commercial zoning districts are as follows:

A. Central Commercial District (CC). To provide an appropriate location for a broad range of retail, residential and service uses. Uses which generate high pedestrian traffic and which do not have large space requirements are appropriate in this district. Residential uses are appropriate on the second floor of structures.

B. Service Commercial (SC). To provide an appropriate location for services, offices, residential and limited retail activities that primarily serve local needs. This district is intended to provide a distinct transition between the more intense activities in the CC district and the less intense activities in the districts on its periphery. Mixed uses of commercial and residential activities are appropriate throughout this district.

C. Residential and Limited Commercial (RC). To provide an appropriate location for permanent and transient residential uses, service and office uses, and limited retail uses that do not adversely impact the residential neighborhood. This district is intended to provide a transition and buffer between the more intense activities in the CC and SC districts and the less intense activities in the R-1 and R-4 districts. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.030 Land Use Regulations.
Schedule II-B prescribes the land use regulations for the commercial districts. The regulations for each district are established by letter designations as follows:

“P” designates permitted use classifications.

“L” designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain specific limitations noted by the number designations and listed at the end of Schedule II-B.

“C” designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a conditional use permit by the Planning Commission. Conditions may apply to these uses, noted by the number designations and listed at the end of Schedule II-B.

These uses are subject to Division I, General Regulations, and may be subject to additional use regulations found in Division IV, Provisions Applying in All or Several Districts. Additional use regulations are also found in CMC 17.14.040, Additional Use Regulations, and are referenced in the schedule. Findings for specific uses may also be required and are found in Chapter 17.64 CMC, Findings Required for Permits and Approvals.

Use classifications are defined in Chapter 17.68 CMC, Use Classifications, and are based on the use classifications listed in the current edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Questions as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use in a particular category will be determined by the Director based on a NAICS Use Categories List, adopted by resolution by the City Council and held at the Department of Community Planning and Building counter. The Director shall make the decision according to the characteristics of the use, and upon the Director’s interpretation of the land use code, the NAICS Use Categories List and the current edition of the NAICS. The determination by the Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission by anyone aggrieved by the decision following the procedures specified in Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals.

3. Proposed commercial uses that are estimated to generate more than 40 vehicle trips per day per 1,000 square feet of floor space, including but not limited to all retail uses, shall be prohibited from operating before 8:00 a.m. or after 8:00 p.m. All other commercial uses shall be prohibited from operating before 6:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m.

I. The Director of Community Planning and Building may authorize temporary uses to occur on private property not exceeding five consecutive days. Temporary uses exceeding five consecutive days shall be referred to the Planning Commission for a decision. Decisions on temporary use permits may be referred to the Planning Commission when, in the opinion of the Director, the use may be objectionable to persons residing or working in the vicinity. The Director shall authorize no more than four temporary uses per calendar year, per property. A temporary use is defined as an activity or event on private property that is limited in duration and is not expressly permitted by the underlying business license or conditional use permit. (Ord. 2017-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Within the RC district only, the required enclosed structure may be substituted for by adequate fencing or screening for the concealment of stored machinery, products or other items, when such substitution is authorized by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.080 Site Area for Multiple Dwellings.
Each site used for apartments and condominiums shall have an area of land not less than the amount required to meet the allowed density established in CMC 17.12.020, Site Development and Building Standards. In mixed-use projects, wherein apartments are constructed above a commercial use, the land area required for the apartments shall not be deducted when computing the allowable area for establishing the commercial use. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.090 Findings – Applicability of Provisions.
The City affirms its 1929 statement that it is essentially and predominantly a residential city with a unique commercial and multifamily residential area noted for its village character. This character arises from the variety in building designs and their modest scale, from the prevalence of contiguous street facades punctuated by frequent courtyards, and from the employment of open space and landscaping as a setting for the mix of apartments and shops within the commercial district.

Most structures built prior to 1940 consist of two-story reinforced concrete or wood frame buildings in a variety of architectural styles. The oldest buildings in the district, although remodeled, retain features associated with the Italianate and other commercial styles typical of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century American “Main Street” vernacular. These include second story bay windows, double-hung sash windows, remnants of board and batten and tongue and groove siding, quoins, and paneled and glazed doors. However, it was the construction that took place under the influence of the Spanish Colonial and Tudor architectural revivals of the 1920s that left the most lasting imprint on the character of the business district. Tudor motifs of half-timbering, grouped rectangular windows, ornate brick work, oriel and bay windows, and complex roofs with multiple gables are interspersed among the Spanish stylistic trademarks of plaster exteriors and tiled roofs, of arcades, of ornate wrought iron and carved wood detailing, of colorful glazed tile for staircase risers, for dados, fountains, planters, and backsplashes, and for patios and courtyards.

This tradition of architectural diversity enhances the character of the commercial district and adds a lively sense of history to Carmel’s village ambiance. Designs for new buildings and modifications to existing buildings should respect this tradition and historical context. The City has consciously chosen architectural eclecticism and encourages originality and invention so long as the results encompass the unifying values of human scale and the use of natural materials and their role in preserving village character. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.100 Design Review and the Basic Review Standard.
In order to protect the unique qualities and characteristics of the central commercial (CC), service commercial (SC) and residential and limited commercial (RC) districts all exterior design changes are subject to site plan and architectural approval as prescribed in Chapter 17.58 CMC, Design Review. The basic standard of review in the commercial district is whether the project constitutes an improvement over existing conditions – not whether the project just meets minimum standards. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.110 Standard of Review and Design Guidelines.
To assist in the design and review process, the City Council has adopted commercial design guidelines. Proposed projects need not strictly comply with every guideline to be approved but deviations should be minor and reasonably related to good design principles and site conditions. When a proposed project involves construction of a new building or the replacement, significant enlargement, or modification of an existing building, applicants are encouraged, first, to consult the design guidelines and then to prepare and submit conceptual or preliminary drawings for review by the Planning Commission. This preliminary review can promote communication between project applicants and the City’s staff and decision-makers, facilitating an understanding of applicable design regulations and avoiding unnecessary expenditures in detailed plans. Development of single-family residences in the RC district shall be consistent with the standards and criteria identified in Chapter 17.10 CMC, R-1 District Design Regulations. (Amended during 8/09 update; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.120 Maximum Building Site Area.
The maximum land area used as a single building site in the CC district is 8,000 square feet, in the SC district is 12,000 square feet and in the RC district is 32,000 square feet. Development of a parcel larger than these limits requires that the land area be broken up into two or more distinctly different developments to avoid the appearance of a single large project and to maintain the small scale and village character of the City. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.130 Building Coverage.
Building coverage is defined as the total ground area of a site occupied by any building or structure as measured from the outside of its surrounding external walls or supporting members. Building coverage includes exterior structures such as stairs, arcades, bridges, permanent structural elements protruding from buildings such as overhanging balconies, oriel windows, stories which overhang a ground level story, and covered carports.

Excluded from building coverage are roof eaves extending less than 30 inches from the face of the building, awnings or covered entryways and masonry walls not greater than six feet in height such as wing-walls, planter walls or grade-separation retaining walls. All site area not counted as building coverage shall be considered open space.

A. CC and SC Districts. Building coverage in the CC and SC districts shall be limited to 80 percent of the site for designs that fully implement Commercial Guidelines III-A. Exceptions may be granted up to a maximum building coverage of 95 percent. No existing courtyard or intra-block walkway shall be removed. This prohibition will reduce the amount of allowable building coverage on some sites.

B. RC District. The maximum allowable building coverage in the RC district shall not exceed 70 percent of the total site area if the land area is 4,000 square feet or less. If the land area is more than 4,000 square feet, the allowable building coverage shall be reduced by one percent for each additional 2,000 square feet of site area. (For example, the allowable building coverage on a 6,000 square foot site equals 69 percent of the total site area.)

Build-To Line. Within the CC and SC districts the street-facing, ground-level facade of each building shall be established on the property line or within two feet of this line for at least 70 percent of each street frontage of the building. Exceptions to this requirement are allowed for entrances to intra-block walkways or courtyards. The remaining 30 percent or less of the building not constructed at the build-to line shall be used for recessed shop entries, landscaping, building articulation or driveways. For additional guidance regarding the build-to line, please see Commercial Design Guidelines III-A (3), (5) and (6) and III-B(4)(5) found in Appendix E2 to this title. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.140 Floor Area Ratio.
Floor area ratio equals the floor area divided by site area. Floor area is defined as the total combined area included within the surrounding exterior walls of all floor levels. Floor area includes all floor spaces used for commercial, manufacturing, residential and miscellaneous land uses including space occupied by mezzanine floors, interior walkways, storage areas above ground, hallways, restrooms, and both interior and exterior wall thicknesses.

Excluded from floor area are the following: underground floor space within a basement, cellar or underground garage when not used for commercial purposes. Also excluded are: underground areas for noncommercial storage or parking and mechanical spaces within a building limited to vent, duct and piping shafts, and mechanical equipment rooms of the minimum size required by the building code.

A. Central Commercial and Service Commercial Districts. The basic floor area ratio allowed for one-story buildings in the CC and SC districts shall be 95 percent of the site area and for two-story buildings shall be 135 percent of the site area. In addition to the basic floor area ratio, two-story buildings may qualify for a maximum 15 percent bonus, which allows a floor area ratio up to 150 percent of the site area.

B. Residential and Limited Commercial Districts. The basic floor area ratio allowed for one-story buildings in the RC district shall be 70 percent of the site area and for two-story buildings shall be 80 percent. In addition to the basic floor area ratio two-story buildings may qualify for a bonus of up to 15 percent, which allows a floor area ratio of up to 95 percent of the site area.

C. Maximum Floor Area. No single structure shall contain more than 10,000 square feet of floor area. Interaccessibility between adjacent structures on one or more building sites by any means that allows passage between structures without first exiting to an open space area shall not be allowed if the resulting floor area contained within the combined structures would exceed 10,000 square feet of area.

D. Floor Area Bonus.

1. Affordable Housing Bonuses. A floor area bonus may be granted for projects in all commercial districts and the R-4 districts in the following instances:

a. Moderate Income. Up to five percent for projects if at least 25 percent of the units in a housing project are reserved for persons of moderate income as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC.

b. Low Income. Up to 10 percent for projects if at least 20 percent of the units in a housing project are reserved for persons of low income as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC.

c. Very Low Income. Up to 15 percent for projects if at least 10 percent of the units in a housing project are reserved for persons of very low income as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC.

Approval of such projects is subject to findings in CMC 17.64.190, Residential Construction at Densities Between 33 and 44 Units Per Acre.

2. Courtyards and Intra-Block Walkways Bonuses. A floor area bonus of up to 10 percent may be granted for projects that include a courtyard and/or intra-block walkway. (Ord. 2009-02, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.150 Building Height.
Height shall be measured from the more restrictive of existing or finished grade. Height limits established in this chapter shall be measured as the vertical distance between any point on the grade of a building site and the highest point of any structure directly above that point on grade.

A. No building shall have more than two stories above grade. Additional underground floors, not defined as a story, may be authorized by a use permit approved by the Planning Commission when the use of these floors is expressly limited to the parking of vehicles, noncommercial storage and mechanical equipment serving the building.

B. The allowable maximum building height shall be determined primarily by the design context established by the prevailing heights of nearby structures facing the same street or intersection and within the same pedestrian field of view (i.e., generally, within 100 feet to either side of, or across the street from the proposed structure). In the CC and SC districts the main building and roof form of all structures shall be limited to a maximum of 30 feet. In the RC and R-4 districts the main building and roof form of all structures shall be limited to a maximum of 26 feet. Small areas not exceeding 10 percent of the proposed building coverage and occupied by special design features such as towers, steeples and ornamentation may exceed these heights if approved by the Planning Commission.

C. Building sites which face, abut or adjoin any property in the R-1 district shall be limited to a height of 24 feet. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.160 Setbacks in the RC and R-4 Districts.
A. The front setback shall be measured from the property line adjacent to the street fronting the property. The rear setback shall be measured from the property line most directly opposite the front. All other property lines shall be considered sidelines. On corner lots with two street frontages the shortest frontage shall be considered the front, regardless of where the driveway or front entry are located.

B. Sites abutting or across the street from an R-4 or RC district require a front setback of at least five feet. Sites abutting or across the street from an R-1 district require a front setback of at least seven and one-half feet. Sites in other locations do not require a front setback.

C. Sites abutting an R-1 or R-4 district require a rear setback of 10 feet. Sites in other locations do not require a rear setback.

D. Sites abutting an R-4 or RC district require a side yard setback of at least five feet along at least 50 percent of each side property line. The remaining 50 percent requires no setback unless the side faces a public street. Any site abutting an R-1 district requires a setback of five feet along the entire side yard.

E. Setbacks required by this section shall be used primarily for landscaping. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.170 Open Space Courtyards and Intra-Block Walkways.
A. Open space is an open area that is free of structures and is visually accessible from public ways or walkways.

B. A courtyard is an open space on private property that is linked to an adjoining sidewalk or walkway in such a manner as to encourage public access. It must be enclosed on at least two sides by buildings and must remain open to the sky. To qualify for floor area bonus provisions the minimum width of a courtyard shall be 20 feet and the minimum area shall be 400 square feet.

C. An intra-block walkway is a publicly accessible ground level pedestrian path providing a connecting route between two or more different streets around a block. Such walkways are often coordinated with courtyards and may involve more than one property ownership to complete. To qualify for floor area bonus provisions the minimum width of an intra-block walkway shall be four feet.

D. Existing courtyards and intra-block walkways are to be conserved as an essential element of the City’s design character and shall not be removed. All proposals to alter the size, location or configuration of a courtyard or intra-block walkway require review by the Planning Commission. Generally, such changes shall be approved only if the Commission finds that the proposed change would be an improvement over existing conditions such as improving public access, allowing for creation of a new or better link with courtyards or walkways nearby or eliminating a safety hazard. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.180 Landscaping.
Landscaping shall be provided in conjunction with development in commercial zoning districts in accordance with Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.190 Public Improvements.
Development projects involving substantial new or replacement construction shall include improvements in the public right-of-way adjacent to the building site to coordinate the design of the development with the design of City streets, sidewalks, walkways and infrastructure improvements and to enhance the overall appearance of the community. (See Policy and Standards for Public Way Design). (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.200 Parking Requirements.
Surface parking, parking structures and driveways design shall be consistent with the provisions of Chapter 17.38 CMC, Off-Street Parking Requirements. In order to preserve the village character and pedestrian orientation of the downtown core, on-site parking within 200 feet of Ocean Avenue shall be prohibited and no site alteration shall be allowed that includes additional driveways, surface parking spaces or underground spaces within this area. Parking requirements on sites where parking is prohibited shall be satisfied through the payment of fees in-lieu of on-site parking as established in Chapter 17.38 CMC, Off-Street Parking Requirements. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.210 Parking Design.
The following standards shall apply to all surface and underground parking designs:

A. The minimum size for all surface and underground parking shall be nine feet by 20 feet for standard spaces and eight and one-half feet by 16 feet for compact spaces.

B. For all parking designs with parking spaces perpendicular to vehicle travel lanes, a minimum of 20 feet shall be provided for automobile back-up room behind standard spaces and 18 feet behind compact spaces. Designs shall minimize the need for multiple or complex turning movements. When angled parking is used, the minimum back-up room shall be that distance specified in the current edition of Architectural Graphic Standards.

C. Compact spaces may constitute 50 percent of the total required spaces. All spaces provided in excess of the minimum requirements may be compact spaces.

D. Driveways shall be located to preserve as much on-street curbside parking as possible. Driveways and other improvements on the property shall be designed for safe and unobstructed visibility of pedestrians and automobile traffic both on and off the site.

E. The following standards apply to the design of surface parking in addition to those required by subsections (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section.

1. Surface parking spaces shall not be constructed within required set back areas in the RC district. Portions of rear or side setback areas may be used for back-up movements as long as the majority of the setback is landscaped.

F. The following standards apply to underground parking garages in addition to those required by subsections (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section.

1. The maximum height of the finished floor level above an underground parking garage facing any public street, way, place or park, shall not be higher than five feet above the existing grade or the official street grade, whichever measurement results in the lower height.

2. Underground parking garages may be constructed within required setbacks if significant trees will not be removed or injured and the setback can still be effectively landscaped. Underground garage designs shall provide sufficient room around the perimeter to accommodate existing and new tree root systems for all trees required as part of the project.

3. The grade of driveways providing access to underground garages shall not exceed five percent in the first 10 feet of the driveway slope near the street or sidewalk and shall not exceed 10 percent in the last 10 feet near the level of the garage floor. The intervening grade shall not exceed 25 percent. Driveway designs shall provide sufficient area to allow drivers to view automobile and pedestrian traffic before merging into such traffic.

4. Garages shall be ventilated to avoid the build-up of exhaust gases. When mechanical ventilation is used, noise mitigation measure shall be incorporated such as low-noise fans, insulated ductwork and vibration absorbing mounting systems. Ducts shall not exhaust toward any building openings or open space on any adjoining property nor toward any on-site or off-site open space, pathway, street, place or park accessible to the public. Venting to the roof is generally preferred. Plans for underground garages shall be reviewed to ensure accessibility for Police and Fire Department personnel during emergencies. To the extent possible, utility meters, vaults and connections should be located within garages or driveways and away from pedestrian walking surfaces. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.14.220 Special Design Topics.
A. Facade Remodels. When facades are remodeled, the adopted commercial design guidelines shall be followed so that the basic design framework of the commercial district is conserved. On buildings where consistency of architectural character has been lost through past actions the preferred design solution is to restore or establish a consistent character. In general, each building should reflect a single type of architecture expressed through consistent use of fenestration, detailing, materials and textures, body color, trim color, awnings and roofs regardless of how many businesses occupy the building. The City strongly encourages the participation of both the property owner and tenant/applicant in the design review process to achieve this end. When plans for remodels are reviewed for approval, the reviewing body must find the following to be true:

1. The proposed modification contributes to, restores or achieves consistency of architectural character and scale when considering the building or courtyard as a whole.

2. The proposed modification does not incorporate materials, patterns or other design elements that would:

a. Call attention to the building.

b. Create a form of advertising or sign through architectural treatment.

c. Would render the storefront unusable by a different business occupant without further remodeling.

d. Create a standardized identification with a particular business use.

B. Roofing Materials.

1. Roofing materials shall be selected that are consistent with the design character of the buildings on which they are placed. Roofing materials should be consistent in color and composition on each roof plane of the building and on the roofs of each building within a single complex or courtyard.

2. All newly installed roofs shall be of noncombustible Class-A materials. Buildings determined by the City to qualify as historic resources may use fire treated wood roofing materials with a fire resistant underlayment assembly approved by the Building Official to meet standards for historic rehabilitation.

3. The Planning Commission may, by resolution, establish a palette of pre-approved roofing materials that shall be used for administrative design review.

4. For existing roofs that do not comply with City design standards, repairs may be made using materials that match the existing roof if no more than 25 percent of the roof area is replaced on the building within any 12-month period. If the roof area replaced exceeds 25 percent of the total roof area on a building the work shall be considered a replacement and shall meet all current design standards.

C. Concealment of Rooftop Equipment.

1. Design Review. Rooftop mechanical equipment such as, but not limited to, heating, cooling and ventilation system equipment shall be concealed from public view. When visible, the enclosures and location of such equipment are subject to design review. Existing rooftop mechanical equipment shall be concealed or relocated out of view whenever a roof is replaced as defined in subsection (B)(4) of this section and when equipment is upgraded or replaced to any extent that requires issuance of a building permit.

2. Standards for Review. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be restricted or shielded from view from the public right-of-way and from adjoining structures by one or more of the following means:

a. Located on a portion of the rooftop that is not visible to the public.

b. Located behind roof forms, parapets or screens that are compatible with the architectural character of the structure.

D. Design Regulations for Exterior Seating Associated with a Restaurant. The following standards shall be used in reviewing proposals for exterior restaurant seating:

1. The proposal shall not result in a net increase in seating capacity.

2. The seating area shall not occupy more than 10 percent of the site area nor more than 30 percent of any courtyard.

3. The area in which the seating is proposed shall be fully contained on private property and shall not interfere with automobile or pedestrian traffic on any public right-of-way or through any intra-block walkway.

4. The seating area shall be demarcated by landscaping or other site features to clearly define its outer boundaries. The boundaries shall be established to preserve a sense of openness and ease of access for pedestrian traffic. (See Appendix E3: Commercial Design Guidelines).

6. Physical structures that enhance comfort such as windscreens, heaters, and exterior lighting shall be shielded from view from the public right-of-way and from intra-block walkways or shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with the village character and the adjacent buildings. (See Appendix E: Commercial Design Guidelines.)

7. Hours of service to outside seating areas shall be regulated through appropriate conditions of approval to prevent impacts on uses in the vicinity.

E. Standards for Display Cases. Except as otherwise provided in CMC 17.40.050, Other Signs Associated With a Business, for restaurant menu boxes, a display case shall meet the following standards and criteria:

4. The project site is 8,000 square feet or less.

B. Review. Design review shall proceed pursuant to Chapter 17.58 CMC. All applications require the approval of a conditional use permit and design review by the Planning Commission. The basic standards for review shall be the standards of this section, including the standards contained in Chapter 17.12 CMC, this chapter, the City’s adopted design guidelines, and the relationship of new construction with surrounding development. Projects or exceptions granted that involve substantial (major) alteration of historic resources shall require issuance of a determination of consistency with the Secretary of the Interior’s standards by the Historic Resources Board.

C. Development Standards. New development shall comply with the standards applicable to the underlying zoning district of the site except as provided in this section. Due to the overall public benefit of affordable housing, the Planning Commission may allow exceptions to the following development standard in order to provide for increased flexibility in design:

1. Density (not to exceed 88 units per acre).

D. Special Requirements. For all projects that exceed five units, the following two amenities are required:

1. Laundry facility or facilities must be provided on site. This requirement can be met by a laundry facility shared in common or with individual facilities in each unit.

2. A common community room(s) totaling at least 250 square feet in size shall be provided on site.

Article I. General Provisions

17.20.010 Purpose and Applicability.
Overlay districts are zoning districts established by the City to carry out specific purposes. They are governed by a set of regulations that address specific subjects, such as archaeological significant resources or environmentally sensitive habitat areas. Overlay districts may be initially established by adding a specific article to this chapter without being actually delineated on a zoning map. At a later time, when an opportunity arises to carry out the intended purposes for one or more sites that meet the criteria for designation, the City Council may adopt an ordinance amending the zoning map to delineate the boundaries of the overlay district. The provisions of the overlay district will then be combined with the provisions of the base zoning district for that site or sites to which the overlay district applies and the more restrictive provisions will govern. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Article II. AS Archaeological Significance Overlay District

17.20.020 Purposes.
The purposes of the AS archaeological significance overlay district are to implement the General Plan/Coastal Plan Land Use Plan and to:

A. Protect archaeological sites in Carmel that can provide evidence of the area’s earliest human habitation, help to document the cultural history of the City, and are often highly significant to Native American descendants as burial grounds or because of their connection to sacred traditions.

B. Provide for the designation of archeological resources and establish explicit guidance for the protection of archeological resources, especially when they are subterranean.

C. Create a clear process and standards for evaluating projects that may affect archaeological resources, and for identifying appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of such projects. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.030 Boundaries of the Archaeological Significance Overlay District.
The boundaries of the AS district are shown schematically on Figures III-1 through III-6. A definitive listing of all properties affected is included with each figure. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.040 Minimum Standards.
The following standards shall apply to all building sites located in the AS district or within any commercial or R-4 district.

A. Applications for new construction or additions, alterations and remodels involving excavation of undisturbed earth shall include an Archaeological Resource Management Report, prepared pursuant to the guidelines established in CMC 17.32.060.

17.20.050 Additional Requirements.
All projects subject to this section shall be subject to the following additional requirements:

A. If any human remains are found at any time during construction, work shall stop and the applicant or his/her agent on the site shall immediately notify the Monterey County Coroner in compliance with applicable State requirements.

B. Exceptions. This section does not apply to emergency repairs that the City Administrator determines necessary to avoid disruption of existing utility service. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.060 Report Guidelines.
The “Archaeological Resource Management Reports (ARMR): Recommended Contents and Format” (cited as the ARMR Guidelines, which were prepared by the California Office of Historic Preservation and attached as Appendix G2 to this title) shall be used as guidelines for preparation of reports required by this article. The Planning Commission and the Department of Community Planning and Building shall use these ARMR Guidelines to review proposed construction and mitigation for potential impacts on archaeological resources. Project plans that fail to achieve reasonable compliance with these ARMR Guidelines shall not be approved. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Article III. Park Overlay District

17.20.070 Specific Purposes.
The specific purposes of the park overlay district are to implement the General Plan/Coastal Plan Land Use Plan and to ensure that development of private property adjacent to parks and open spaces is compatible with their continued enjoyment. It is the intent of these regulations to protect park resources from the visual and physical impacts that may be associated with development of private property near designated parklands, to enhance the public enjoyment of parks and to preserve the habitat values of parks. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.080 Boundaries of the Park Overlay District.
The boundaries of the PO district are shown schematically on Figures III-7 through III-10. A definitive listing of all properties affected is included with each figure. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.090 Minimum Standards.
The following standards regulating construction activity and use shall apply to all building sites located in the park overlay district. The provisions of the park overlay district shall be coordinated with the ESHA overlay district whenever a property is located within both overlay districts.

A. The site design must include a drainage plan that is adequate to prevent erosion and excess runoff as determined by the Building Official. The site shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system.

B. No tree shall be removed within the park overlay district without written approval from the City Forester regardless of whether the removal is associated with construction activities.

C. All proposed construction must maintain a setback of at least 15 feet from any property line that also constitutes a park boundary. However, this special setback shall not apply to property across the street from a park. The Planning Commission may modify other setbacks through the design review process to provide flexibility for properties unreasonably restricted by this required park setback.

D. When any construction activity is proposed on a site in the park overlay district, the site design shall include a landscaping plan in accordance with Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping.

17.20.100 Required Planning Commission Review.
In addition to any other reviews required by this code, the following types of projects in the park overlay district shall require Planning Commission review:

A. Projects located on nonrectangular building sites for which the Commission has not established setbacks during prior approvals;

B. Projects located on building sites larger than 8,000 square feet in area for which the Commission has not established setbacks during prior approvals and/or which do not qualify for administrative design review (track one) approval;

C. Projects of more than one story and/or taller than 18 feet in height;

D. Projects involving construction of a new dwelling unit or demolition of an existing dwelling unit; and

E. Projects that, in the opinion of the Director of Community Planning and Building, represents a substantial deviation from standard design and construction practices in the neighborhood and is not addressed by these regulations or which otherwise may be inconsistent with the purposes of this district or the General Plan. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.110 Review Criteria.
Proposed projects requiring Planning Commission review as established in CMC 17.20.100 shall require approval through the track two design study process (see Chapter 17.58 CMC, Design Review), using the following standards prior to the issuance of any building permits.

A. Projects Exceeding the Limits on Number of Stories and/or Height. The Planning Commission may grant approval of:

1. A second story;

2. An increase in building height up to a maximum of 24 feet; and

3. Approvals granted under this section shall not violate any height limits established for the property by the underlying zoning district or any other overlay districts. In granting approval for these increases, the Commission shall make the following findings:

a. That due to the topography of the site relative to the adjoining park or open space land, the proposed building would not exceed the height or bulk of an 18-foot one-story structure built on a site at the same grade as the adjoining park or that topography and height are irrelevant because of the location of the building on the site avoids view of the buildings from the park.

b. That those portions of the building visible from the park will exhibit a human scale and residential character through the use of simple building forms and natural materials that will not detract from the enjoyment of the park or open space by the public.

B. Projects Requiring Modified Setback Standards. Through the track two design study process, the Planning Commission may approve an adjustment of setbacks on park overlay district properties from those normally required in order to preserve equity in the amount of buildable area on a lot after application of the 15-foot setback from park boundaries required by CMC 17.20.090, Minimum Standards. Sites with a side lot line adjacent to parklands that cannot obtain a satisfactory modification of setbacks through this procedure may apply for a variance to reduce the width of the 15-foot setback from the park boundary. In granting requests for modified setbacks, the Planning Commission shall make the findings listed below.

1. That the total area of all setbacks is approximately equal to the area of the lot that would be contained in setbacks if the increased setback from the park established in CMC 17.20.090, Minimum Standards, were applied.

2. That a minimum width of at least three feet will be maintained for the full length of all setbacks.

3. That by reducing any setbacks, the proposed structure will not interfere with safe access to other properties in the neighborhood or otherwise result in damage or injury to the use of other adjoining properties.

4. That structures proposed for construction within reduced setback areas will be compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood and will exhibit a human scale without excessive building bulk or visual mass.

C. Projects on Irregularly Shaped Lots or Lots Larger Than 8,000 Square Feet. On those lots that are irregular in shape or that exceed 8,000 square feet in area, the Planning Commission shall establish setbacks that are appropriate for the property and that are consistent with the purposes of the PO district. Where a large lot size creates an opportunity to establish significantly increased setbacks from adjoining parklands, and the topography or shape of the site allow sufficient area to build away from the park, the Planning Commission may designate larger setbacks for the property that preserve an open space buffer adjacent to the park while providing a reasonable area to build elsewhere on the property.

D. In designating these setbacks the Commission must adopt the findings listed in subsection (B) of this section and the following findings:

1. That the proposed setbacks afford maximum protection for the adjoining parklands for the benefit of the public while still accommodating reasonable development of the property.

2. That the proposed setbacks are designated on an approved plan attached to the permit or on a scenic easement for purposes of documentation and recordation. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Article IV. Beach and Riparian Overlay District

17.20.120 Purpose.
The purpose of the beach and riparian overlay district is to provide review standards applicable to public and private property development located near public beach lands to ensure that proposed development is compatible with the public enjoyment of the City’s coastal resources and with the California Coastal Act. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.130 Applicability.
The regulations of this article shall apply in the beach and riparian overlay district. The beach overlay district is an overlay district, which may be combined with any of the other districts specified in the municipal code. The provisions of the beach and riparian overlay district shall be coordinated with the ESHA overlay district whenever a property is located within both overlay districts. The regulations of this article shall apply in addition to the regulations of any district with which the beach and riparian overlay district is combined. In the event of any perceived conflict between the provisions of this article and any other provision of these regulations, this article shall control. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.140 Boundaries of the Beach and Riparian Overlay District.
The beach and riparian overlay district shall be coterminous with the California Coastal Commission’s coastal development permit appeal jurisdiction and shall include all public and private property, wholly or in part, within the boundaries of the appeal jurisdiction described in CMC 17.54.020. The boundaries of the beach and riparian overlay district are shown schematically on the official zoning map maintained by the Planning Director. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.150 Coastal Development Permit Required.
Unless exempted by CMC 17.52.100, Development Excluded from Coastal Permit Requirements, all new development, as defined by Chapter 17.70 CMC, shall require a coastal development permit, in addition to any other permit(s) required by law. Development undertaken pursuant to such a permit shall conform to the plans, specifications, terms and conditions approved in granting the permit. Notice, hearing and appeal procedures shall be established in Chapter 17.52 CMC, Permit Procedures, and Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals.

17.20.160 Permit Standards.
The following standards shall be used by decision-making bodies in approving or denying a coastal development permit in the beach and riparian overlay district. The regulations in subsection (A) of this section apply to all properties in the overlay district. The regulations in subsection (B) of this section apply to only those properties in the overlay district located west of Carmelo or North San Antonio Avenue. No building permit for any development, as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC, including but not limited to new construction, additions, exterior alterations or change in land use shall be approved unless a coastal development permit is approved taking into consideration all of the following as may be appropriate to the scope of the project.

A. Regulations Applicable to All Properties in the Overlay District.

1. View Protection. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect public views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural landforms, to be visually compatible with the character of the surrounding areas, and where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas, while ensuring the private property owner reasonable development of the land.

2. Location. All development shall be located and designed to avoid conflict with recreational use of any adjacent public property or conflict with coastal resources.

3. Design Compatibility. All development shall be compatible in design with existing buildings in the area for the purpose of protecting the neighborhood character and consistent with the R-1 design guidelines established in CMC 17.10.010.

4. Review of City Needs. The property has been reviewed for potential acquisition and the review indicated the City has no need to acquire the property.

5. Utilities. All utilities connecting the development to the source in the public rights-of-way shall be placed underground.

6. Sewer Services. The property shall be connected to the sanitary sewer system upon issuance of the permit. Alternatively, the Planning Commission may authorize an area-wide agreement among several adjacent properties (executed through no-protest agreements) for future connection to the sanitary sewer if the infrastructure for a single connection would place an undue burden on a single property owner.

7. Drainage. A drainage system shall be provided for all new development to minimize erosion, minimize runoff, and to infiltrate and filter stormwater prior to conveyance off-site.

8. Projects on Irregularly Shaped Lots or Lots Larger Than 8,000 Square Feet. On those lots that are irregular in shape or that exceed 8,000 square feet in area, the Planning Commission shall establish setbacks that are appropriate for the property and that are consistent with the purposes of the beach and riparian overlay district. Where a large lot size creates an opportunity to establish significantly increased setbacks from adjoining beach lands, and the topography or shape of the site allow sufficient area to build away from the beach, the Planning Commission may designate larger setbacks for the property that preserve an open space buffer adjacent to the beach while providing a reasonable area to build elsewhere on the property.

B. Regulations Applicable to Properties in the Overlay District Located West of Carmelo Street or North San Antonio Avenue.

1. Access. Development shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea. Potential public right of access shall be reviewed on the property and, where appropriate, made a condition in the permit.

2. Subdivision Limitations. No further subdivision shall be approved within the beach and riparian overlay district. No lot line adjustments shall be approved that would result in a net increase in potential building sites.

3. Height. All proposed construction shall be limited to a height of 18 feet above the existing grade or finished grade whichever results in a lower height.

4. Open Space. On sites adjacent to the beach all buildings shall be located to preserve maximum open space on the site as viewed from the beach. Generally, a setback of at least 15 feet shall be maintained along any property line facing the beach. The Planning Commission may at its discretion reduce any required rear, side or front yard to not less than three feet so as to preserve maximum open space on the site adjacent to the beach for public benefit.

5. Tree Removal. No tree shall be removed within the beach and riparian overlay district without written approval from the City Forester regardless of whether the removal is associated with construction activities. Trees on City property shall be trimmed and/or removed only by City tree crews or under the supervision of the City Forester. Removal of dead cypress trees on City property in this district shall require approval by the Forest and Beach Commission. When any construction activity is proposed on a site in the beach and riparian overlay district, the site design shall include a landscaping plan consistent with the provisions of Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping.

6. Prohibition on Private Development Needing Protection. Except as provided in CMC 17.20.190(C), new development shall not be approved where geologic evidence concludes that shoreline protective structures will be necessary to protect the new development at the time of construction, or within 100 years of development.

7. Public Structures. Stairs, retaining walls, fences, pipelines, and similar public or quasi-public facilities located on coastal bluffs shall require a coastal development permit.

8. Parking. On sites of 6,000 square feet or greater, two on-site parking spaces per primary dwelling unit shall be provided for all new residential development in the beach and riparian overlay district. One of these spaces may be established as an uncovered tandem space within the front or side yard setback located on the driveway in front of a garage or carport or elsewhere on the property where parking is allowed by the underlying zoning district.

9. Setbacks. Private development proposed on ocean-fronting parcels shall comply with the setback requirements of the applicable primary zoning district, except where a lot line is adjacent to a coastal bluff or sand dunes, or where public access and/or recreational areas are required in compliance with these regulations. Proposed private developments shall be set back from the top of the bluff or adjacent sand dunes as provided by this subsection.

a. Bluff Retreat Setback Requirements. New structures shall be set back a sufficient distance from any bluff top to be safe from bluff erosion for a minimum of 100 years as determined by a site-specific geology report, prepared in compliance with CMC 17.20.170(B), Geology Report; provided, that in no case shall the minimum setback be less than 25 feet.

b. Use of Bluff Retreat Setbacks. No development except public access pathways, public restrooms, stairways and associated public recreational or infrastructure facilities shall be permitted within the bluff retreat setbacks identified in site-specific geologic reports.

c. Dune, Access and Recreational Area Setbacks. Additional bluff top and/or dune setbacks may be required in compliance with Local Coastal Plan policies to establish a buffer from natural sand dune areas, to reduce visual intrusion on adjacent recreational areas or to accommodate public access and enjoyment of adjacent recreational areas. (See also CMC 17.20.180, Public Access).

10. Findings Required. In designating beach and riparian overlay district setbacks for private property the Commission shall adopt the following findings:

a. That the combined area contained within all setbacks is at least equal to the area of the lot that would be included within setbacks if the special beach setback established in subsection (B)(9) of this section were applied (i.e., achieving no net loss of setback area).

b. That a minimum width of at least three feet will be maintained for the full length of all setbacks.

c. That by reducing any setbacks the proposed structure will not interfere with safe access to other properties in the neighborhood or otherwise result in damage or injury to the use of other adjoining properties.

d. That structures proposed for construction within reduced setback areas will be compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood and will exhibit a human scale without excessive building bulk or visual mass.

e. That the proposed setbacks afford maximum protection for the adjoining parklands for the benefit of the public while still accommodating reasonable development of the property.

f. That the proposed setbacks are designated on an approved plan attached to the permit or on a scenic easement for purposes of documentation and recordation. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.170 Application Content – Additional Requirements.
Permit applications for development on ocean-fronting parcels shall include the following information where applicable, in addition to all the information required by Chapter 17.52 CMC, Permit Procedures.

A. Erosion Control Plan. All development permit applications involving substantial alterations to existing buildings or site design, or construction of new buildings on ocean-fronting parcels shall include a site-specific erosion control plan. The plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer qualified in hydrology and soil mechanics, and shall ensure that the development will not contribute to the erosion or failure of any bluff face, and will eliminate or mitigate any adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply to the maximum extent feasible. New development that (1) increases site coverage by more than two percent of the site area, or (2) involves grading that will affect drainage patterns on or off-site, or (3) involves either a rebuild demolition or construction of a new building or shoreline structure shall include a site specific erosion control plan that includes controls on grading (i.e., timing and amounts), best management practices for staging, storage, and disposal of construction materials, design specifications of sedimentation basins, and landscaping/revegetation of graded or disturbed areas. New development shall further include a site-specific polluted runoff control plan that demonstrates how runoff will be diverted from impermeable surfaces onto permeable areas of the property in a nonerosive manner to filter and infiltrate stormwater prior to conveyance off-site.

B. Geology Report. A geology report shall be required when structures are proposed within an area between the face of the bluff, and a line described on the bluff top by the intersection of a plane inclined at a 20-degree angle from horizontal, passing through the toe of the bluff or cliff, or 50 feet inland from the bluff top, whichever is greater.

C. Preparation and Contents of Geology Report. A required geology report shall be prepared by a qualified, licensed engineer approved by the City, and shall be submitted with the permit application for the proposed structure. The report shall consider, describe, and analyze the following:

1. Cliff geometry and site topography, extending the surveying work beyond the site as needed to depict unusual geomorphic conditions that might affect the site;

2. Historic, current, and foreseeable cliff erosion, including investigation of recorded land surveys and tax assessment records in addition to the use of historic maps and photographs where available, and possible changes in shore configuration and sand transport;

3. Geologic conditions, including soil, sediment, and rock types and characteristics, in addition to structural features such as bedding, joints, and faults;

4. Evidence of past or potential landslide conditions, the implications of such conditions for the proposed development, and the potential effects of the development on landslide activity;

5. Impact of construction activity on the stability of the site and adjacent area;

6. Ground and surface water conditions and variations, including hydrologic changes caused by the development (e.g., introduction of sewage, effluent, and irrigation water to the groundwater system, alterations to surface drainage, and the like);

7. Potential erodibility of the site and mitigation measures to be used to ensure minimized erosion problems before and after construction (i.e., landscape and drainage design);

8. Effects of marine erosion on the coastal bluffs;

9. Potential effects of seismic forces resulting from a maximum credible earthquake; and

10. Any other factors that might affect slope or bluff stability. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.20.180 Public Access.
This section establishes requirements for the dedication and improvement of public access to, and along the coast, in conjunction with proposed development and new land uses in order to ensure public rights of access to the coast are protected as guaranteed by the California Constitution. Coastal access standards established by this section also satisfy the California Coastal Act.

A. Protection of Existing Coastal Access. Development may not interfere with public rights of access to the sea where the rights were acquired through use or legislative authorization. Public access rights may include but are not limited to the use of dry sand and rocky beaches to the first line of terrestrial vegetation. Development shall not interfere with the public’s right of access to the sea by eliminating free public beach parking along Scenic Road, the Del Mar parking lot, and San Antonio from 2nd Avenue to Santa Lucia Avenue, or any street rights-of-way west of San Antonio.

B. Access Dedication Requirements. Proposed development and new land uses located between the ocean and the first public road may be required to provide vertical (perpendicular) access from the public road to bluff and beach areas, and lateral access along the beach, shoreline and bluff tops, where the review authority first makes specific findings documenting the need for additional public access on and/or through the site, and the relationship of the required dedication to the impacts on existing access, or needs for additional access created by the project.

C. Timing of Access Requirements. The type and extent of access to be dedicated, and/or constructed and maintained, as well as the method by which its continuing availability for public use is to be guaranteed, shall be established at the time of land use permit approval, as provided by this section.

1. Dedication. Shall occur before issuance of construction permits or the start of any construction activity not requiring a permit.

17.20.220 Environmentally Sensitive Habitats.
A. General. This section sets forth regulations for the protection and enhancement of environmentally sensitive habitat areas (ESHAs).

B. Applicability. The provisions of this overlay district apply to all new development or substantial alteration of existing development proposed within designated ESHA or within ESHA buffer areas (located within 30 feet of designated ESHA). Sites that are within an ESHA or ESHA buffer area, and are subject to these overlay regulations, are mapped in the Land Use Plan of the Local Coastal Program.

C. Permits for Development within the ESHA Overlay District. Unless exempted by CMC 17.52.100, Development Excluded from Coastal Permit Requirements, all new construction, additions, design alterations or changes in land use in the ESHA overlay district shall require a coastal development permit in accordance with the provisions of this title, in addition to any other permit(s) required by law. Development undertaken pursuant to such a permit shall conform to the plans, specifications, terms and conditions approved in granting the permit. Notice, hearing and appeal procedures are established in Chapter 17.52 CMC, Permit Procedures, and Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals.

D. Biological Resources Report. A coastal development permit application for development on a site that is subject to this section shall include a biological resources report that complies with the following requirements.

1. Qualifications of Preparer. The report shall be prepared by individuals qualified by education, training, or experience to draft these reports in a professional and competent manner, and who are on the City’s list of consulting biologists. The Director, upon receipt of a resume demonstrating an individual’s special capabilities, may authorize acceptance of additional experts. The Director’s decision to accept or deny consulting biologists shall be final.

2. Report Contents. The biological resources report shall:

a. Include a biological survey of the site that identifies the type and location of sensitive resources and documents the habitat values of the property. The report shall also evaluate the impact that existing and proposed development may have on the habitat, including whether the existing and proposed development will result in a significant disruption of habitat values. The report shall identify feasible alternatives to avoid disrupting the habitat values. If avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures shall be identified that protect the resource from disturbance or degradation, and a program for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation measures.

b. Identify potential significant impacts on the habitat from noise, sediment, and other potential disturbances that may occur during project construction.

c. Verify that proposed setbacks from ESHAs will be adequate to protect the ESHA from disturbance or degradation or recommend, where applicable, more effective setbacks. Setbacks for privately held property in Pescadero Canyon shall serve to minimize disruption of habitat values while leaving a reasonable minimum area for development of a single residential dwelling.

d. Recommend performance criteria for revegetation of the site, including milestones for the reestablishment of native vegetation cover in ESHA and EHSA buffer areas affected by development. All projects involving an increase in lot coverage or tree removal shall be conditioned to provide an appropriate number and mix of native trees and/or native shrubs consistent with ESHA habitat.

e. Recommend other conditions of approval for habitat maintenance and the restoration of damaged habitats. At a minimum, other conditions shall include:

i. An agreement by the landowner to dedicate and manage steep slopes, areas adjacent to riparian resources or areas that serve as a buffer for habitat of special status species as conserved open space. Vegetation removal and slope destabilization from foot traffic should be reduced by controlling access, drainage and through appropriate site design.

ii. Limitation of site development to avoid direct loss or indirect effects on native trees.

iii. Avoidance of removal of native vegetation to the fullest extent possible.

iv. Removal of invasive shrub species that can be removed without resulting in substantial erosion.

v. Prohibition of the use of heavy equipment on intact native soils that support native vegetation important to the habitat and on steep slopes (excavation along slopes shall be conducted by hand).

E. General Development Standards.

1. Performance Standards. All development adjacent to or within an ESHA shall comply with the following requirements:

a. New development shall be designed, sited, constructed, and maintained so as to avoid, or minimize if avoidance is not feasible, disruption of the habitat values in the ESHA.

b. New development within an ESHA shall be limited to uses that are dependent upon the resource.

c. Where feasible, damaged habitats shall be restored as a condition of development approval.

d. Development shall be consistent with the biological continuance of the habitat.

2. Vegetation Removal. Existing native vegetation in the ESHA overlay district shall not be removed unless authorized through coastal development permit approval to accommodate construction or to maintain public safety. After construction, disturbed areas shall be replanted to provide for the reestablishment of native vegetation cover to the degree specified by an approved landscaping plan prepared pursuant to Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping. Existing, nonnative invasive vegetation growing on private property located in the ESHA or within 30 feet of the ESHA shall be removed as part of the landscaping plan unless the decision-making body determines (a) that vegetation removal would cause unwarranted damage to ESHA resources, or (b) that the difficulty of removing the invasive plants would be an excessive burden given the scope and nature of the approved development.

3. Exotic Landscaping. Landscaping in areas adjacent to ESHAs with exotic plants shall be limited to immediate outdoor living space immediately adjacent to the proposed development. Invasive nonnative plants including but not limited to Pampas grass, Acacia, Genista, ivy and nonnative iceplants pose a threat to indigenous plant communities and shall not be approved as part of any proposed landscaping.

4. Fencing. Fencing shall not be allowed with ESHAs; fencing adjacent to ESHAs shall be restricted to that which will not impact public views or the free passage of native wildlife and shall employ design and materials determined by the City to be compatible with the visual and biological character of the habitat.

5. Resource Protection During Construction. Habitat areas containing vegetation that is essential to the maintenance of the habitat and/or rare or endangered plant or animal species shall be protected from disturbance by construction activities. Temporary wire mesh fencing shall be placed around habitat prior to construction, and protected areas shall not be used by workers or for the storage of machinery or materials. Inspections for compliance shall occur prior to and during construction.

6. Fertilizer, Herbicide, and Other Chemical Use. The use and disposal of any fertilizer, herbicide, or other chemical for invasive species removal shall follow the written directions of the manufacturer, shall comply with all conditions required by the City, and shall be accomplished in a manner that will fully protect adjacent native vegetation. In no case shall the use of fertilizer, herbicide, or other chemical be allowed within 100 feet of a riparian habitat.

F. Streams and Riparian Vegetation. Development adjacent to a stream shall be sited and designed to protect the habitat and shall be compatible with the continuance of the habitat.

1. Limitation on Streambed Alteration. Channelization, dams or other substantial alteration of stream channels are limited to:

a. Water supply projects; provided, that quantity and quality of water from streams shall be maintained at levels necessary to sustain functional capacity of streams, wetlands, estuaries and lakes.

b. Flood control projects, where such protection is necessary for public safety or to protect existing commercial or residential structures, when no feasible alternative to streambed alteration is available;

c. Construction of improvements to fish and wildlife habitat; and

d. Maintenance of existing flood control channels. Streambed alterations shall not be conducted unless consistent with all applicable provisions of the Local Coastal Program and these regulations and if applicable, permit approval from the California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and California State Water Resources Control Board.

a. Permitted Uses Within the Setback. Permitted uses are limited to passive recreation, educational (interpretive) facilities, utility lines, pipelines, drainage and flood control facilities, bridges and pedestrian trails, if the City first finds that:

i. Alternative locations and routes are infeasible or more environmentally damaging; and

ii. Adverse environmental effects are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible.

b. Riparian Habitat Setback Adjustment. Coastal development permit approval may include the reduction of a minimum riparian setback if the City first makes the findings required by subsection (F)(2)(a) of this section, and all the following findings; provided, that in no case shall structures be allowed closer than 30 feet from a stream bank.

i. The adjustment is necessary to allow a principal permitted use of the property and redesign of the proposed development would not allow the use with the standard setbacks; and

ii. The adjustment is the minimum that would allow for the establishment of a principal permitted use.

3. Removal or Alteration of Riparian Vegetation. Proposals for the removal or alteration of riparian vegetation shall be set forth in the landscaping plan required in Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping. The removal, cutting or alteration of vegetation that protects a riparian habitat shall not be permitted except:

a. For streambed alterations allowed by subsection (F)(1) of this section;

b. Where no feasible alternative exists;

c. Where an issue of public safety exists;

d. Minor public works projects, including but not limited to utility lines, pipelines, driveways and roads, where the Planning Director determines no feasible alternative exists; or

e. To locate a principally permitted use on an existing lot of record where no feasible alternative exists, and the review authority first makes all the findings provided in subsections (F)(2)(a) and (F)(2)(b) of this section.

G. Required Findings. A coastal development permit on a site that is subject to the requirements of this section may be approved only when the review authority first finds that there will be no significant negative impact on the sensitive habitat, and the proposed development and use will be consistent with the biological continuance of the habitat, in addition to all other findings required by these regulations for the coastal development permit by CMC 17.52.020, Development Applications, and Chapter 17.64 CMC, Findings Required for Permits and Approvals.

In addition to the general purposes listed in Chapter 17.04 CMC, Zoning Districts Established, the specific purposes of the community plan (CP) overlay districts are to:

A. Establish a procedure for the conservation and development of defined planning areas within the City.

B. Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in quality design and conservation of Carmel’s natural, cultural and historic resources.

C. Encourage conservation and improvement of community facilities, trees and open space.

D. Encourage coordinated, compatible infill development and affordable housing on sites that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods.

The City has prepared community plans for specific areas of the City. The CP overlay district provides a mechanism for administering these plans by requiring that all new construction, alterations and additions conform to the policies and standards contained within these plans following adoption by the City. The term “community plan (CP)” includes specific plans as established by California Government Code Section 65450 et seq. as well as neighborhood plans and conservation plans. As used in this chapter, the term “community plan (CP)” includes all these variations. (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.22.020 Land Use Regulations.
No use other than an existing use shall be permitted in a CP district except in accord with an approved community plan (CP). Any permitted or conditional use authorized by this title may be included in an approved community plan (CP); provided, that use is consistent with the General Plan land use designation(s) for land within the CP district. (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.22.030 Development Regulations.
A. Residential Unit Density. The total number of dwelling units in a community plan (CP) shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in any district by the General Plan/Coastal Plan Land Use Plan (LUP) for the total area allocated to residential use.

B. Other Regulations. All regulations prescribed by this title apply, except as may be modified by an approved community plan (CP). (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.22.040 Procedure.
A. Initiation. Rezoning to a community plan (CP) district may be initiated by City staff, the Planning Commission or the City Council.

B. Findings Required to Define Boundary. Establishment of any community plan area shall require adoption of a finding by the Planning Commission that:

1. Special buildings, streetscapes, neighborhood open space areas or site characteristics exist and justify including such land within a community plan (CP); or

2. Various public and/or private properties, whether contiguous or not, share a common interest or are related by a topic of special concern that justifies establishment of a community plan to address said topic or interest.

C. Required Plans and Materials. In addition to the information required for a zoning map amendment in Chapter 17.52 CMC, Permit Procedures, an application for CP rezoning shall be accompanied by a draft community plan (CP) which will be approved by resolutions at the same time as the adoption of the ordinance establishing the specific CP district. The community plan (CP) shall include a text and diagram or diagrams that specify:

1. The purpose of the community plan (CP) and the relationship between the community plan (CP), the General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan and the underlying zoning district(s).

2. The distribution, location and extent of the uses of land, including open space, within the area covered by the plan.

3. Standards and criteria by which development will proceed, and standards for conservation, development and utilization of natural and historic resources, where applicable.

4. Any deviations from the land use regulations for the underlying zoning district(s) that establish requirements for permitted, conditional, temporary and accessory uses.

5. Any deviations from development regulations for the underlying zoning district(s) that establish the physical standards for development including, but not limited to, setbacks, building heights, building coverage, landscaping and parking.

6. Design criteria for all buildings and structures.

7. Plans or criteria for required facilities, infrastructure or other improvements.

8. If a community plan (CP) does not contain sufficient detail to allow for subsequent project construction or site improvements without further discretionary review, the community plan (CP) shall identify what additional discretionary review(s) are necessary.

9. Any other studies including environmental review.

D. Review and Approval. The terms and regulations of the proposed community plan (CP) shall be reviewed and approved at the same time as the proposed reclassification to a CP district. The Planning Commission shall consider the proposed plan and rezoning at a noticed public hearing and provide the City Council with a recommendation on the proposed plan and rezoning application.

E. Effective Date and Expiration. A community plan (CP) is effective 30 days after adoption of the ordinance creating the CP district. (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.22.050 Planning Commission and City Council Action.
The Planning Commission shall consider an application for reclassification to a CP district as prescribed in Chapter 17.62 CMC, Reclassifications and Amendments, and shall, at the same time, consider the proposed community plan (CP) accompanying the application. A Commission recommendation to reclassify land to a CP district shall be accompanied by a resolution approving a draft community plan (CP).

A. Planning Commission Action. A recommendation for rezoning to a CP district must be accompanied by a resolution either recommending approval or conditional approval of a community plan (CP) and findings that:

1. The community plan (CP) is consistent with the General Plan, the Local Coastal Land Use Plan, adopted design guidelines, and other applicable policies and is compatible with surrounding development;

2. The community plan (CP) will enhance the potential for superior community design in comparison with the development under the base district regulations that would apply if the plan were not approved;

3. Deviations from the existing district regulations are justified by compensating benefits of the community plan (CP); and

4. The community plan (CP) has been reviewed and recommended for approval or conditional approval.

B. City Council Action. After a noticed public hearing, the City Council shall approve, modify, or reject the Planning Commission’s recommendation; provided, that a substantive modification not previously considered by the Commission shall be referred to the Commission for a report. Failure of the Planning Commission to report within 40 days after referral or such longer period as may be designated by the Council shall be deemed approval of the proposed modification by the Commission. (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.22.060 Adoption, Mapping and Amendments.
A. After City Council adoption of a community plan, an amendment to the City’s certified Local Coastal Program shall be submitted to the California Coastal Commission pursuant to Public Resource Code Section 30515. The City may submit a proposed amendment either as an amendment that will take effect automatically upon Coastal Commission approval, or as an amendment that will require formal City Council adoption after Coastal Commission approval.

B. Each CP district shall be designated on the zoning map by the letters “CP” followed by a number. A table on the Zoning Map shall show for each numbered district the community name and a reference to the adopting ordinance and/or the resolution approving the plan. Upon approval by the City Council and the Coastal Commission, each community plan shall be incorporated into the municipal code/implementation plan as a separate article of this chapter.

C. Amendments to an adopted community plan constitute amendments to the zoning ordinance/coastal implementation plan and shall be subject to the same adoption processes and public notice requirements.

D. Each CP district shall be designated on the zoning map by the letters “CP” followed by a number. A table on the zoning map shall show for each numbered district the community name and a reference to the adopting ordinance and the resolution approving the plan. (Ord. 2007-02, 2007; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.040 Eligibility Criteria for the Carmel Inventory.
The following types of resources are to be included in the Carmel Inventory: individual properties, historic districts, and archeological resources. Historic districts may consist of multiple properties that are united geographically and located with a defined boundary, or isolated properties that do not share a geographic boundary but are united by a common theme (also known as a “thematic grouping”). The Director and the Historic Resources Board, based on recommendations of qualified professionals shall use the following criteria in making determinations on the eligibility of properties for the Carmel Inventory. To be eligible for the Carmel Inventory, historic resources:

A. Should be representative of at least one theme included in the Historic Context Statement.

B. Shall retain substantial integrity. Integrity (association, feeling, setting location, design, materials and workmanship) shall be documented by comparing the existing condition of the resource with the original building plans or early records and photographs, or other substantial evidence (e.g., literature review, Sanborn maps, architectural files, land records) and/or by physical inspection by a qualified professional. Integrity shall be assessed by (1) defining the physical features that must be present for a property to represent its significance, (2) determining whether these features are still visible enough to convey significance, (3) determining whether the property needs to be compared to other similar properties to understand its significance, and (4) determining which aspects of integrity are vital if the property is to qualify as a resource (see National Register of Historic Resources, Bulletin #15).

C. Should be a minimum of 50 years of age and shall meet at least one of the four criteria for listing in the California Register at a national or Statewide level of significance (primary resource) or at a regional or local level of significance (local resource) per CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(a)(3):

1. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of local or regional history or the cultural heritage of of California or the United States;

2. Is associated with the lives of persons important to local, California or national history;

3. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of a master, an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or

4. Has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the local area, California or the nation.

D. To qualify for the Carmel Inventory, an historic resource eligible under California Register criteria No. 3 (subsection (C)(3) of this section) only, should:

1. Have been designed and/or constructed by an architect, designer/builder or contractor whose work has contributed to the unique sense of time and place recognized as significant in the Historic Context Statement; or

2. Have been designed and/or constructed by a previously unrecognized architect, designer/builder or contractor if there is substantial, factual evidence that the architect, designer/builder or contractor contributed to one or more of the historic contexts of the City to an extent consistent with other architects, designer/builders or contractors identified within the Historic Context Statement; or

3. Be a good example of an architectural style or type of construction recognized as significant in the Historic Context Statement; or

4. Display a rare style or type for which special consideration should be given. Properties that display particularly rare architectural styles and vernacular/utilitarian types shall be given special consideration due to their particularly unusual qualities. Such rare examples, which contribute to diversity in the community, need not have been designed by known architects, designer/builders or contractors. Rather, rare styles and types that contribute to Carmel’s unique sense of time and place shall be deemed significant.

E. Districts designated as historic resources shall (1) have more than 50 percent of all properties within the district boundaries that contribute to the identifiable characteristics of the specific area or neighborhood; (2) represent a theme from the historic context of the early development of Carmel; (3) have a majority of all properties within the district boundaries that demonstrate the functions, styles, time period and lifestyles of the period of significance; (4) have a majority of all properties within the district boundaries that qualify as contributing resources that evidence a high level of integrity based on physical condition, retention of historical characteristics and relationship to the original site; and (5) represent or potentially represent historical information important locally, regionally, or to the State or nation.

F. All properties included in the inventory as of the date of final certification of the LCP, are hereby included in the Carmel Historic Resource Inventory unless removed by the Historic Resources Board pursuant to CMC 17.32.070(D). Recordation and notice of the inclusion of these resources in the inventory shall be provided pursuant to CMC 17.32.070(C). All subsequently identified Historic Resources shall be added to the Carmel Historic Resource Inventory and reported to the Historic Resources Board.

G. Any interested parties or organizations may submit to the City requests or applications for identification of historic resources to be included in the inventory. The City shall process such requests or applications within 60 days, consistent with the procedures established in this chapter.

H. A resource less than 50 years old may be eligible if it is of exceptional importance to the City, State, or nation based on its unusually strong contribution to history, architecture, engineering or culture, or because it is an integral part of an historic district. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.050 Alteration of Property.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, association, partnership or other legal entity to directly or indirectly alter, remodel, demolish, grade, relocate, reconstruct or restore any property without first determining if the property is eligible for the inventory.

B. No application for property development shall be deemed complete unless it includes a determination that the property is either eligible or ineligible for the Carmel Inventory. For properties where eligibility has not yet been established, the Department shall initiate the process for determining eligibility upon the filing of any application for property development.

C. A property owner may request a determination of eligibility prior to the filing of a development application by submitting a written request to the Department. The Department shall establish the required content and form of such requests and/or applications. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.060 Determining Eligibility for the Carmel Inventory.
A. Historic Context Statement.

1. The City shall maintain an Historic Context Statement.

2. The purpose of the Historic Context Statement is to establish a baseline of information against which the potential historic significance of a property is evaluated. “The significance of an historic property can be judged and explained only when it is evaluated within its historic context. His-

ontexts are those patterns or trends in history by which a specific occurrence, property, or site is understood and its meaning (and ultimately its significance) within history or prehistory is made clear.” (National Register Bulletin: “How to Apply the National Register Criteria For Evaluation,” p. 7). However, exclusion of a resource type from the context statement shall not preclude a finding of historical significance by a qualified professional.
3. The Historic Context Statement shall be updated at least every five years. Updates shall be submitted to the California Coastal Commission as LCP amendments.

4. Staff may, as part of any updates to the Historic Context Statement, require that a reconnaissance survey be conducted by a qualified professional.

B. Initial Assessment of Historic Significance.

1. Upon the filing of a preliminary site assessment application, development application, property owner request for determination or as initiated by the Department, an initial assessment of historic significance shall be conducted to determine whether the property may have historic resource potential sufficient to warrant conducting an intensive survey.

2. The initial assessment shall include a records search and site visit. The records search shall include a review of building permits, plans, early photographs and other substantial evidence (i.e., literature review, architectural files, land records and Sanborn maps) in the City’s or County’s files, in order to determine the age and degree of prior modification to the property. The records search shall also identify whether or not the property is located within the boundaries of any archaeological overlay district or historic district, or was previously included in the Carmel Inventory or Carmel Register. During the site visit, staff shall identify the architectural style, period, and significant features of the structure or dwelling and examine the exterior of the building or structure and its setting in order to determine whether any significant alterations have occurred and/or whether sufficient integrity remains to warrant additional survey work. Staff shall also note the spatial relationships to notable site features and adjacent properties. At staff’s option, the initial assessment may be performed by a qualified professional retained by the City.

3. If, based on the initial assessment, the property is determined to be ineligible for the inventory, is outside the archaeological overlay zone, and no evidence of archaeological resources is present, then no further action is required except as otherwise stated below, and the Department shall issue a determination of ineligibility consistent with subsection (D) of this section.

4. If the property appears to meet the criteria for the inventory, the Department shall order that an intensive survey of the property be conducted. All intensive surveys shall be performed by a qualified professional under contract to the City.

5. If, based on the initial assessment, a definitive determination of eligibility or ineligibility cannot be made, the Department shall require an intensive survey by a qualified professional.

C. Intensive Survey.

1. If an intensive survey is required it shall include a review of original research outlining the details of the property’s history, a determination of the relationship of the property to the Historic Context Statement, and a finding as to whether or not the property meets the criteria for inclusion in the inventory. All properties determined to be historic shall be documented on a standardized inventory form as established by the State Office of Historic Preservation and shall become part of the Carmel Inventory after an administrative determination.

2. If the intensive survey determines that the property is ineligible for the inventory, then all provisions of subsection (D) of this section shall apply.

3. If the intensive survey determines that the property qualifies as an historic resource and is therefore eligible for the inventory, the survey also shall specify whether the property is a local resource or a primary resource.

a. Primary resources include:

i. Resources previously listed in the National Register at the national or Statewide level of significance.

ii. Resources formally determined by the Keeper of the National Register or by SHPO as eligible for listing in the National Register at the national or Statewide level of significance.

iii. Resources identified in the survey as eligible for listing in the National Register at the national or Statewide level of significance.

b. Local resources include resources identified in the survey as eligible for listing in the California Register and/or for listing in the National Register at less than Statewide level of significance.

i. Regionally significant shall mean resources that are important to the history and development of the Monterey Peninsula.

ii. Locally significant shall mean resources that are only important to the history and development of the City.

4. The intensive survey shall identify to the degree practicable:

a. Primary, contributing, component and noncontributing features or resources.

b. Aspects of the setting important to retaining the qualities that make the property historically significant.

D. Determinations of Ineligibility.

1. Upon making a determination that a property does not qualify for the Carmel Inventory, the City shall issue a determination of ineligibility. Each determination of ineligibility shall include the street location, the block and lot identification, age of structure, and a statement as to why the property is not eligible for the Carmel Inventory.

2. All determinations of ineligibility shall be (a) provided to the property owner, (b) provided to anyone who has requested a copy of such determinations, (c) transmitted to members of the Historic Resources Board, and (d) made available for public review during normal business hours at City Hall for 10 days. Upon receipt, any member of the Historic Resources Board may call a determination of ineligibility up for review by the Board by filing a written request with the Department during the appeal period.

3. Determinations of ineligibility made by the Department may be appealed to the Historic Resources Board by any aggrieved person as established in CMC 17.32.180. Determinations of ineligibility shall not be final until all appeal processes have run. The appeal period for determinations of ineligibility shall be 10 days from the date the decision was circulated and made available for public review as established above.

4. Determinations of ineligibility shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of issuance except for properties developed less than 50 years prior to the determination, but more than 45 years prior to the determination, and which are ineligible for the Carmel Inventory primarily due to insufficient age. All such determinations of ineligibility shall be valid only until the building, structure or object reaches the age of 50 years.

E. If the property is (1) located within the archaeological overlay district, or (2) is located within a commercial or R-4 district, or (3) staff determines that the site may potentially contain archaeological resources, and the project involves excavation or grading then the Department shall order that a Phase 1 Report (survey) of the property be conducted by a qualified professional to evaluate the potential for archaeological resources to be present on the property. All reports shall follow the Archeological Resources Management Report (ARMR) format.

1. Phase 1 Report: Archaeological Survey. A Phase I survey and report shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall include a records search from the Northwest Regional Information Center, documentation of an on-site survey, and archival research on the history of the property. Native American consultation(s) may also be appropriate. As part of the Phase I survey process, the Department may require preparation of a California Archaeological Inventory form (DPR 422A) and/or a California Archaeological Isolated Artifact form (DPR 422H). If the Phase 1 Report concludes that the property clearly does not contain archaeological resources, then no further action or mitigation is required and the Department shall issue a determination of ineligibility for the inventory.

2. Phase II Report: Testing. If the Phase 1 Report concludes that the property does or may contain archeological resources, then a Phase II Report shall be prepared by a qualified professional, in consultation with appropriate Native American representative(s), in order to identify appropriate mitigation measures (e.g., monitoring, avoidance, capping, documentation, recovery, etc.).

3. Phase III Report: Recovery. If the Phase II Report concludes that recovery is the appropriate mitigation then a Phase III Report shall be prepared by a qualified professional in consultation with appropriate Native American representative(s).

4. A copy of each Archaeological Resources Management Report shall be forwarded to the Northwest Regional Information Center. The City shall keep confidential the specific location of archeological resources, where appropriate. A copy of any Archaeological Resources Management Report that does not identify the specific location of the resource on the property may be made public by the City.

5. Archaeological reports shall be conducted under contract to the City, at the property owner’s expense. The property owner shall provide access to the site and interior of any building or structure thereupon at a mutually agreed time. All recovered artifacts shall become the property of the City for use in research, interpretation and/or transmittal to appropriate entities. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

1. A property owner of a resource included in the inventory may apply to the City to have the resource removed from the inventory.

2. An historic resource in the Carmel Inventory shall be presumed historically significant and shall not be removed unless substantial evidence demonstrates that it is not an historic resource. Any decision to remove a resource from the inventory shall require a public hearing by the Historic Resources Board and shall be based on a recommendation by a qualified professional. Substantial evidence shall include, but is not limited to:

a. An intensive survey prepared by a qualified professional under contract to the City re-evaluating whether the property is eligible for the Carmel Inventory. If the new intensive survey provides substantial evidence that the property does not meet the historic resource criteria and recommends removal from the inventory, the survey shall document why prior survey documentation affirming that the property met the criteria for inclusion in the inventory was inaccurate or inappropriate or otherwise is no longer valid.

b. A finding supported by substantial evidence that any loss of integrity, from the level of integrity documented in prior survey(s), was not the result of unapproved alterations, neglect or property nuisance as established in CMC 15.57.010. If any documented losses of integrity are found to be due to unapproved alterations, neglect or property nuisance, the property owner shall be subject to the enforcement actions of this chapter.

3. The removal of a resource from the inventory shall require Board approval. Board actions regarding removal of a resource from the inventory (approvals or denials), may be appealed to the City Council.

4. If the final action on the application is to approve removal, staff shall within 90 days submit to the County Recorder for recordation, and the County Recorder shall record the administrative determination by the Department specifying that the property is not an historic resource and has been removed from the inventory.

a. The resolution shall include the name of the current property owner, the decision-making body, the specific action taken regarding historical resources designation (removal from inventory), and a legal description of the property.

b. A copy of the recorded resolution shall be mailed to the property owner.

5. Resources removed from the inventory shall not be considered historic resources for purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act upon final City approval of the removal. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.080 Qualifications of Professional Consultants.

3. All historic resources previously designated for listing under prior City ordinances shall remain on the register except as provided in subsection (C) of this section.

B. Historic Districts.

1. Historic districts may be considered for inclusion in the Carmel Register at the request of a property owner within the proposed district, or as initiated by the Historic Resources Board, or the City Council, if the district meets the criteria for inclusion in the Carmel Inventory. After preparation of explanatory and supporting material by the City or other interested party, the City shall notify owners of contributing properties within the proposed historic district of the request for consideration of listing and shall provide owners an opportunity and time frame in which to file a notice of objection to listing. Such objection shall take the form of a notarized letter certifying that (1) the party is the sole or partial owner of a contributing resource and (2) the party objects to listing on the register. No action on listing of a historic district in the register shall be taken if owners of more than 50 percent of the contributing resources within the district file an objection to listing.

C. Resources Not Currently in the Inventory.

1. A property not previously surveyed, or a property previously surveyed but not included in the inventory, may be evaluated or reevaluated to determine if it is eligible for the register at the property owner’s request.

2. In order to determine eligibility, the initial assessment and survey requirements of CMC 17.32.040 shall be followed.

4. Upon completion of the survey the Department shall determine whether the property meets the criteria as an historic resource and is therefore included on the Carmel Inventory, consistent with CMC 17.32.040, Eligibility Criteria for Carmel Inventory, and CMC 17.32.060, Determining Eligibility for the Carmel Inventory. Properties that are determined not to be historic shall not be eligible for the inventory or the register.

a. Resources that qualify as primary resources shall be automatically listed in the register.

b. Resources determined to be local resources shall be listed in the register, subject to Board approval.

D. Notification of Property Owners. Consistent with Public Resources Code Section 5029, staff shall within 90 days submit to the County Recorder for recordation, and the County Recorder shall record, a certified resolution by the Department establishing the listing in the register.

1. The resolution shall include the name of the current property owner, the designating entity (Department), the specific historical resources designation (inventory), and a legal description of the property.

2. A copy of the recorded resolution shall be mailed to the property owner.

E. Removal of Resources from the Register.

1. Primary Resources. A primary resource shall not be removed from the register unless it has been previously removed from the inventory. The removal of a primary resource from the register shall be subject to Board approval and may occur concurrent with removal from the inventory.

2. Local Resources. A local resource may be removed from the register at the request of the property owner. The removal of a resource from the register shall be subject to Board approval.

17.32.100 Benefits Available to Historic Resources on the Register.
The Board is authorized to develop and implement preservation incentive programs that are consistent with this chapter. The following preservation incentives are available to owners of resources listed in the Carmel Register:

A. Historic Plaque Program. Historic resources listed on the Carmel Register shall be provided with a brass plaque suitable for mounting on or near the resource. The plaque shall include the name of the resource, the date of construction, the City seal and other information appropriate for the resource as determined by the Board. In developing this program the Board shall establish criteria for uniform design, content and location.

B. Mills Act Historical Property Contracts.

1. Purpose. A Mills Act contract under State law is an agreement between the City of Carmel and a property owner of an historic building listed on the Carmel Register. The property owner benefits from a reduction in property taxes, and the City is assured that the historic building is rehabilitated, maintained and preserved. All Mills Act contracts shall be established, processed and approved in conformance with California law. The primary purpose for offering Mills Act contracts in the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea is to assist in the rehabilitation or restoration and long-term maintenance of historic resources.

2. Applicability. All properties listed on the City’s Historic Register in all districts that have been, and will be, preserved in their historic size, form and design without significant alterations or additions are eligible for Mills Act contracts.

3. Term of Contract. All Mills Act contracts shall have a term of 10 years and one year shall be added to this term annually upon each anniversary date of the contract unless one or both parties have taken action to terminate the contract. The City Administrator shall be authorized to initiate contract termination on behalf of the City based on recommendations of the Department. The contract rights and obligations are binding upon all successive owners of the property during the life of the contract. The property retains the lower Mills Act tax rate when the property is sold. To end a contract, either party may submit a notice of nonrenewal to the other party. Such notices shall cause the contract to terminate at the end of the then-current 10-year contract period. Cancellation of a contract by the City due to noncompliance requires a public hearing and, if cancelled, results in the immediate termination of the contract and a penalty equal to 12.5 percent of the assessed market value of the property.

4. Contract Requirements. The contract will require that the historic elements of the property are maintained in good condition. This will include a plan for rehabilitation and maintenance and may include a program to restore deteriorated elements. All recipients of Mills Act contracts are required to implement a rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance plan prepared by a qualified professional and to submit an annual report to the Department specifying all work that has been done to maintain and preserve the historic resource over the year in compliance with the approved rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance plan. All rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance work shall be completed in conformance with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. All Mills Act contracts shall specify that the rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance plan shall be updated at least every 10 years by a qualified professional and approved by both parties.

5. Applications.

a. Staff shall make available appropriate Mills Act application materials. Applications for contracts that will commence in the following calendar year shall be submitted no later than June 30th of each year. This annual schedule provides sufficient time from receipt of application materials for a recommendation by the Historic Resources Board (HRB), the City Council to approve and the City Clerk to cause to be recorded with the Monterey County Recorder approved contracts within the calendar year in which application materials are received. The contract term would begin January 1st of the year following the application.

b. The following materials are required for a complete application:

i. A completed application form and all filing fees as established by resolution of the City Council.

ii. A full legal description of the property attached and labeled “Exhibit A.”

iii. A rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance plan for the historic resource prepared or reviewed by a qualified professional together with a cost estimate of the work to be done attached and labeled as “Exhibit B.”

iv. Photos of the exterior of the property attached to assist in the rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance of the property attached as “Exhibit D.”

6. Review Process.

a. Upon submittal of a complete application, staff will prepare a staff report for review by the HRB. The HRB shall consider each application for a Mills Act contract and make recommendations to the City Council to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application.

b. The City Council shall, in a public hearing, consider recommendations from the HRB and resolve to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed contract with sufficient time for action by the City Clerk so that recordation of approved contracts occurs prior to December 31st of the year in which the application is received.

c. To grant approval of a Mills Act contract, the HRB and City Council shall make all of the following findings:

i. The building is designated as an historic resource by the City and is listed on the Carmel Register.

ii. The proposed rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance plan is appropriate in scope and sufficient in detail to guide long-term rehabilitation/restoration and maintenance. Required maintenance and rehabilitation should be more significant than just routine maintenance that would be expected for any property.

iii. Alterations to the historic resource have been in the past, and will continue to be in the future, limited to interior work and to exterior rehabilitation and alterations that:

(A) Comply with the Secretary’s Standards (future additions only); and

(B) Do not significantly alter, damage or diminish any primary elevation or character-defining feature; and

(C) Do not increase floor area on the property by more than 15 percent beyond the amount established in the documented original or historic design of the resource; and

(D) Do not result in any second-story addition to a single-story historic resource.

iv. The Mills Act contract will aid in offsetting the costs of rehabilitating and maintaining the historic resource.

v. Approval of the Mills Act contract will represent an equitable balance of public and private interests and will not result in substantial adverse financial impact on the City.

d. Upon approval of a contract by the City Council, the City Clerk shall transmit the contract, with the appropriate fee, to the County Recorder’s Office. The property owner is responsible for all filing fees. After recordation, the recorded contract shall be transmitted to the County Assessor. The Assessor calculates the exact tax savings. Property owners are required to report to the State Office of Historic Preservation that a Mills Act contract has been completed.

e. The City Council may establish by resolution a limit on the number of contracts that can be approved during any calendar year.

C. Parking Reductions. On-site parking requirements for any continued occupancy, change, or intensification in use for any register-listed resources may be waived by the Board. In granting such waivers, the Board may establish that the number of parking spaces required shall be the same as the number of spaces that exist on the property as of the effective date of listing in the register.

D. Nonconformities. Existing structural nonconformities associated with a historic resource listed on the register (e.g., setback encroachments, excess height or insufficient parking, etc.) that are essential to maintaining the integrity of the resource shall be treated as conforming for the purposes of applying CMC 17.36.030 and 17.36.040, in the review of maintenance, repair, alterations and additions. Design nonconformities shall be expanded or created only when this is found necessary to achieve consistency with the Secretary’s Standards.

E. Tax Credits for Commercial Properties. Commercial properties listed on the Carmel Register and the National Register may be eligible for Federal rehabilitation tax credits.

F. Fee Reductions. When a property on the register is rehabilitated in conformance with the Secretary’s Standards, the City will reduce the building permit fee, applicable to the specific area of the rehabilitation, by 25 percent. (Ord. 2010-03 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.110 California Historical Building Code (SHBC).
A. The SHBC provides alternative regulations for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration, or relocation of qualified historical buildings or properties. Resources in the inventory shall be treated as qualified historical buildings or properties.

B. The SHBC shall be used for any resource in the inventory. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.120 Alteration of Historic Resources.
A. Determination of Consistency. It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, association, partnership or other legal entity to directly or indirectly alter, remodel, demolish, grade, relocate, reconstruct or restore any historic resource without first obtaining a determination of consistency with the Secretary’s Standards, complying with the requirements of the CEQA, and obtaining a building permit or other applicable permit from the City. Demolition of structures identified as historic resources on the Carmel Inventory is prohibited except as provided in CMC 17.30.010. The alteration of any structure identified as an historic resource on the Carmel Inventory in a manner that is inconsistent with the Secretary’s Standards is prohibited unless one or more of the findings established in CMC 17.64.050 is adopted.

B. Routine Maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior improvement or any exterior architectural feature in or on any historic resource that does not involve a change in design, materials, or external appearance thereof, nor does this chapter prevent the alteration, restoration, demolition, removal, or relocation of any such improvement or architectural feature when the Department certifies to the Historic Resources Board that such action is required for the public safety due to an unsafe or dangerous condition and cannot be remedied under the California Historical Building Code.

C. Duty to Keep in Good Repair. The owner, occupant or any other person in actual charge of a historic resource shall keep in good repair the exterior portions of all such buildings, structures, or improvements, and all interior portions thereof whose maintenance is necessary to prevent the deterioration and decay of any exterior improvement or exterior architectural features.

D. Tax Credit Certifications. Alterations or relocations that are the subject of a tax credit certification application shall be submitted to the Board for informational purposes. The Board shall have the option to submit comments on the application to the appropriate State or Federal reviewing agency. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.130 Design Study, Building Permit or Other Application for Alteration of Property.
A. Upon submittal of a design study, building permit or other application for alteration of the property, the City shall determine if the subject property contains historic resources and is therefore eligible for the Carmel Inventory of Historic Resources.

1. Properties that are already known to contain historic resources are included in the inventory.

2. Properties that are known not to contain historic resources are those that have been subject to an initial assessment or intensive survey and received a determination of ineligibility pursuant to this chapter. A determination of ineligibility issued by the Department within five years of the date of the application shall constitute a showing that the property is not an historic resource. The Department shall have the discretion to accept determinations of ineligibility that are older than five years, if there have been no changes to the Historic Context Statement or other demonstrated changes in circumstance that are applicable to the subject property and if there is no substantial new evidence available that would affect the determination.

3. If a property is not included in the inventory and has not been subject to a previous site assessment or survey, the City shall require that the procedures for the identification of historic resources be followed, prior to determining whether a determination of consistency, pursuant to this chapter, is required for the project.

B. If the applicant has applied for, but has not completed the process of eligibility determination, the applicant may request that the property be treated as eligible for purposes of expediting the application review.

C. If it is determined that the subject property contains historic resources, the applicant shall be required to obtain a determination of consistency with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties as part of the project review process. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.140 Determination of Consistency with the Secretary’s Standards.
A. All major and minor alterations to historic resources shall require a determination of consistency with the Secretary’s Standards. The Department shall make consistency determinations for minor alterations. Staff may shall retain a qualified professional, when necessary, to assist in making the determination.

B. Consistency determinations for major alterations shall require an evaluation by a qualified professional and review and approval by the Historic Resources Board. Qualified professionals retained by the City to evaluate proposed alterations to historic resources shall be at the applicant’s expense. The Department shall determine whether the proposed project constitutes a minor or major alteration. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.150 Historic Evaluation Process for Minor Alterations.
A. For the purposes of evaluating alterations to historic resources, the following shall constitute minor alterations:

1. Any alteration that is not a major alteration.

2. Maintenance, repair, restoration or in-kind replacement of severely deteriorated component features.

3. Electrical and or plumbing work within buildings, limited to upgrading or in-kind replacement, with the exception of historic fixtures that shall be repaired.

4. Installation of mechanical equipment within a building, that does not affect the exterior of the building, visible elements of the interior, or require installation of new duct work throughout the interior.

5. Repair or partial replacement of porches, cornices, exterior siding, doors, balustrades, stairs, or other trim when the repair or replacement is done in-kind to match existing material and form.

6. Replacement of severely damaged or deteriorated windows when the replacement is done in-kind to match the existing materials and form.

7. Replacement of window panes in-kind or with double or triple glazing so long as the glazing is clear and untinted and the window does not alter the existing window material and form. The replacement of existing archaic or decorative glass is not included in this exclusion.

8. Repair or replacement of roofing, gutters and downspouts when replacement is done in-kind to match existing materials and form.

9. Repair or replacement of roadways, driveways and walkways when work is done in-kind to match existing material and form.

10. Repair or replacement of fencing and freestanding exterior walls when work is done in-kind to match existing materials and form.

11. Repair or replacement of signs or awnings when work is done in-kind to match existing materials and form.

12. Repair or replacement of interior stairs when work is done in-kind to match existing materials and form.

B. Repair of interior walls including plaster and dry wall to match existing walls. This can include the repair of interior cracks up to one inch wide.

C. Temporary bracing or shoring as part of stabilization.

1. Anchoring of masonry walls to floor systems so long as anchors are embedded and concealed from exterior view.

2. Reconstruction or repair of parapets, chimneys, and cornices to match existing in all material and visual aspects. Bracing and reinforcing of chimneys and fireplaces as long as bracing and reinforcing are either concealed from exterior view or removable in the future.

3. Stabilization of foundations and the addition of foundation bolts.

4. The installation of the following seismic upgrades; provided, that such upgrades are not visible on the exterior or within character-defining historic interiors: cross bracing on pier and post foundations; metal fasteners; collar ties; gussets; tie-downs; strapping and anchoring of mechanical, electrical or plumbing equipment; installation of plywood diaphragms beneath first floor joists, above top floor ceiling rafters and on roofs; and the addition of seismic automatic gas shut-off valves.

5. Installation of temporary, reversible barriers such as chain link fences, and polyethylene sheeting or tarps.

D. Staff shall issue a determination of consistency for minor alterations that comply with the Secretary’s Standards. In approving minor alterations, staff shall ensure that integrity of the resource is maintained, that all character-defining features are maintained and that no change will be authorized that would diminish the historic resource’s value or result in a subsequent determination that the resource is no longer eligible for the Carmel Inventory. Staff may prepare and process a categorical exemption for the proposed alteration. The Department shall then cause the processing of the permit application to continue pursuant to standard City practices. Minor alterations that are found not to comply with the Secretary’s Standards shall be considered and processed as major alterations requiring an evaluation by a qualified professional and final action by the Historic Resources Board. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.32.160 Historic Evaluation Process for Major Alterations.
A. For the purposes of evaluating alterations to historic resources the following shall constitute major alterations:

1. Any minor alteration not in compliance with the Secretary’s Standards.

2. Substantial alterations as defined in CMC 17.70.020.

3. Additions exceeding two percent of existing floor area or volume.

4. Relocation on the same site and with the same setting or context.

5. Demolitions as defined in CMC 17.70.020.

B. Determinations of consistency for major alterations shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall be supported by written documentation that (1) identifies which of the Secretary’s Standards are applicable to the project, (2) reviews the proposed project, and (3) explains the basis of the determination.

1. If a proposed major alteration is found by the qualified professional to be consistent with the Secretary’s Standards, the project shall be presumed to be consistent for purposes of making a preliminary determination regarding any required environmental documentation and staff shall forward the application and evaluation to the Board for action.

a. If the Board concurs with the evaluation, the Board shall issue a determination of consistency and adopt any appropriate conditions of approval. Any finding of compliance by the Board shall be supported by substantial evidence.

b. If the Board does not concur, the Board may request additional information prior to issuance of a determination of consistency, or may issue a finding of noncompliance with the Secretary’s Standards. Any finding of noncompliance by the Board shall be supported by substantial evidence.

C. If an evaluation concludes that a proposed alteration is not consistent with the Secretary’s Standards, the report shall list aspects of the project that are not consistent along with guidance for modifying the project to comply with the Secretary’s Standards. The applicant shall be required to elect in writing within 10 days of receipt of the evaluation whether they will (a) work with the City to modify the project to conform, (b) request a mediation process, or (c) request that processing of the application proceed without modification.

1. An evaluation that concludes that a project is not consistent with the Secretary’s Standards shall constitute evidence of substantial adverse impact to an historic resource. If the applicant does not choose to modify the proposed alteration to comply with the Secretary’s Standards, the Department shall require preparation of an EIR as part of the environmental review process prior to review issuance of any permits for the project.

2. If the applicant chooses to work to modify the proposed project to comply with the Secretary’s Standards, and the required revisions would be substantial, the Department may require that the applicant withdraw the current permit application and resubmit the revised project as a new application.

3. Staff, with the concurrence of the applicant, may authorize the qualified professional to work with the applicant to develop a revised plan that complies with the Secretary’s Standards, or may require the qualified professional to recommend conditions of approval that, if adopted and implemented, would cause the project to comply with the Secretary’s Standards. This additional work shall be performed under contract to the City, at the applicant’s expense. The qualified professional upon completion of consultation shall submit to the Department a summary of the results of the process.

4. If the applicant requests a mediation process and staff concurs, the City shall retain, at the expense of the applicant, a second qualified professional to serve as an independent mediator. Parties to the mediation shall include (1) the applicant and their representatives, (2) the City as represented by the Director, and (3) the original qualified professional(s) that determined that the proposed alteration does not comply with the Secretary’s Standards. The mediator shall be responsible for structuring the mediation process and facilitating negotiation among the parties. The mediator shall complete an independent evaluation of the project, determine if it complies with the Secretary’s Standards and, if necessary, make recommendations for modifications to achieve compliance.

a. If all parties reach agreement that the proposed alteration is consistent with the Secretary’s Standards, or reach agreement on modifications that will achieve consistency, staff shall forward the application, evaluation, and work products of the qualified professional, along with any conditions of approval to the Board for review and approval of a determination of consistency.

b. If all parties to the mediation do not reach agreement, then the original determination of inconsistency shall be considered evidence of substantial adverse impact and an Environmental Impact Report shall be prepared prior to any further action on project permits.

5. Staff shall forward the application, evaluation, and work products of the qualified professional(s), along with any conditions of approval to the Board for review and approval of a determination of consistency.

1. Documentation may be required of any resource in the inventory to be demolished and/or for the property as a whole;

2. Design review for compliance with the Secretary’s Standards may be required for any subsequent development on the property. With respect to demolition of resources located within a district, the City shall take into account the importance of the affected resource to the integrity of the district, and may: limit the size of new development to that of the existing structure; require that the scale of new development be harmonious with other structures which contribute to the district’s character; require retention or reconstruction of one or more building features; and/or require that any replacement structure be of like kind or quality to the demolished structure and contribute to or otherwise support the character and context of the district;

3. Suspension of the issuance of the demolition permit for 180 days to allow time to take such steps as the City deems necessary to preserve or rehabilitate the structure concerned. Such steps may include consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens, exploration of the possibility of moving the resource proposed for demolition, and exploration of the possible acquisition of the property by public and private agencies. In the case of purchase or relocation by a third party, demolition may be denied where a third party is willing and able to purchase the property or relocated the resource, and makes a bona fide offer to purchase the property or resource at fair market value, as determined by appraisal, within the time established by this section.

D. No permit to demolish an historic resource shall be issued without the concurrent issuance of a building permit for a replacement structure or project for the property involved unless necessary to address a public health and safety emergency.

E. Upon demolition of a resource the Department shall remove the resource from the inventory. Where adverse impacts result from substantial alterations, the Board shall determine if the resource retains historic integrity. If the resource has lost integrity, the Board shall direct that the resource be removed from the inventory. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.34.040 Plan Requirements.
All new development or substantial alteration of existing development shall require submittal and approval of a forest enhancement and management plan and a landscape plan.

A. Site Plan. Prior to the submittal of design plans, a site plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional documenting topography, drainage features, existing trees and structures, street edge treatments, and existing conditions on adjacent properties.

B. Preliminary Site Assessment. Following submittal of the site plan, the City’s planning staff and City Forester shall prepare a preliminary site assessment that includes an evaluation of the design character, streetscape attributes, potential historic resources, and forest resources of the block and neighborhood, as well as the resource constraints of the site.

C. Forest Enhancement and Maintenance Plan. Following the preparation of a preliminary site assessment, applicants shall submit a forest enhancement and maintenance plan which shall:

1. Address the impacts of the proposed development on the existing forest conditions of the site.

2. Recognize the constraints of the land and work within these limitations.

3. Minimize the extent of the excavation and fill on a site to avoid adverse impacts on trees, consistent with Chapter 17.48 CMC, Trees and Shrubs, and to ensure that new development follows the natural contours of the site.

D. Landscape Plan. Following approval of the forest enhancement and maintenance plan, a landscape plan shall be submitted in a manner and form established by the City Forester. Landscape plans shall document all proposed plantings as well as any tree removal, replacements, or relocations and shall document how new plantings will conform with the forest enhancement and maintenance plan. Landscape plans shall include the following:

1. Contents Required. Approved landscaping plans shall include a separate and simplified account of required new and replacement trees in eight-and-one-half-inch by 11-inch format to allow the Director to monitor the establishment of new trees and their growth to maturity. The account shall include a map of the location of required new and replacement trees, the date each tree was planted, and the size and species of each tree planted.

2. Approval Authority. The decision-making authority for the development permit shall also approve the landscaping plan or may delegate approval authority to the Planning Director who shall review the plan in consultation with the City Forester. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.34.050 Relation to Landscape Design Guidelines.

17.34.060 General Landscaping Standards.
A. Plant Selection.

1. Landscape designs shall use plant species similar in character to those species established along the block and on adjoining properties except that use of invasive species is prohibited.

2. A minimum of 75 percent of new plant materials on a site shall be native plants and/or noninvasive drought-tolerant plants as determined by the City Forester.

3. Much of Carmel’s forested charm comes from the informality of unplanted public rights-of-way. This also provides for off-street parking and adequate space for public safety vehicles to pass through the streets safely. All plants within landscaped areas on any public right-of-way adjacent to private property shall be drought-tolerant and low water use predominantly native species as determined by the City Forester.

4. A minimum of 75 percent of new plant materials in all open space areas on project sites in the commercial, R-4, and R-1 districts shall be planted with drought-tolerant and low water use species as determined by the City Forester.

B. Landscape Design.

1. Plant material located in areas visible from the street or other public places shall be arranged in a relaxed, informal pattern consistent with the character of the Carmel forest. Formal, unnatural arrangements shall be avoided except for focal points.

2. The use of bedding plants and exotic flowering species shall be limited to small accents at walkways, entries, or near special site features, unless otherwise approved by the City Forester.

C. Paving Materials and Design.

1. Paving materials used for driveways, patios, and walkways, shall be consistent in color and texture with native materials. Use of materials that allow for percolation of rain into the soil and reduce water run-off is encouraged.

2. Paved areas shall be designed to be small, informal, and intimate. Large, continuous areas of paving shall be avoided. Additional landscaping may be required to soften the appearance of paved areas.

D. Irrigation and Maintenance.

1. Landscaping plans for projects in any zoning district shall, where feasible, require the use of water retention storage devices such as cisterns or underground bladders to capture precipitation or surface runoff for landscape maintenance purposes or detention basins or berms to retain water on-site for natural percolation into the soil.

2. Irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize the use of water. Landscaping irrigation systems for projects in any zoning district shall use low-output sprinkler heads and/or drip irrigation.

3. Landscaping plans for projects in any zoning district that include paved areas shall include design features such as sand-set paving and/or drainage collection and distribution systems that enhance surface water percolation.

4. Privately installed irrigation systems within a public right-of-way adjacent to private property shall require the approval of an encroachment permit and shall be allowed only in the commercial and R-4 zoning districts. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.34.070 Landscaping Standards for Residential Districts.
A. General Standards.

1. All properties, private and public, located in the R-1 or R-4 district shall contribute to the urbanized forest or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood by harboring an appropriate mix of upper and lower canopy trees and/or shrubs consistent with the neighborhood context and the neighborhood streetscape. Forested neighborhoods shall perpetuate the Monterey Pine, Monterey Cypress, Coast Live Oak or Redwood forest that predominates in the vicinity.

2. Proposed residential projects shall preserve adequate space for the growth of trees or other vegetation.

3. When the Planning Commission reviews building plans for proposed projects, adequate space shall be preserved for the growth of trees or other vegetation and the Commission shall ensure that such space is used for this purpose through the review and approval of landscaping plans. The purpose of this requirement is to perpetuate and enhance the established forest character throughout the district on both public and private property in each neighborhood where it exists. The proposed location of upper canopy trees shall also be studied for their impact on the protected viewshed in the R-4 district established in Chapter 17.12 CMC.

B. Public Right-of-Way in the R-1 District.

1. Landscaping in public rights-of-way in the R-1 district is limited to drought-tolerant plants that are native and are consistent with the character of the Monterey Peninsula environment.

2. Plants should be natural in character and informally arranged to reflect the surrounding forest atmosphere. Landscaping shall not include bedding plants, highly colorful flowering plants and “formal plant arrangements.”

3. Landscaping should consist of leafy ground covers, low shrubs and/or trees of the urbanized forest. Natural dirt rights-of-way with pine needles is also permitted. Parking spaces may be defined in the unpaved right-of-way with landscaping.

4. Paving, gravel, boulders, logs, timbers, planters or other above-ground encroachments are prohibited, except paving for driveways. Pathways paved only with decomposed paved only with decomposed granite or other soil materials made of soil materials are permitted. (Amended during 8/09 update; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.34.080 Landscaping Standards for Commercial Districts.
A. Landscaping Requirements for All Commercial Development. The following standards apply to all commercial districts in the City.

1. A minimum of 50 percent of the required open space on each site shall be landscaped. Landscaping may include nonliving materials such as garden benches, water features and patterned paving treatments as long as the combined total area of such plant alternatives is not used as more than 25 percent of the required landscaping on any site. All landscaping improvements shall include upper canopy trees on-site and/or in the sidewalk in front of the property whenever possible.

2. Building sites contiguous to the R-1 district shall provide sufficient landscaping and trees to blend visually with open space and landscaping on adjacent sites.

B. Landscaping Requirements for Gasoline Stations. Landscaping shall be provided and maintained in a healthy state to give an attractive appearance to the public street along 80 percent of the street frontage not occupied by driveways. Planting shall be of a type that will provide a minimum height of four feet along no less that 60 percent of the required landscaped frontage.

C. Landscape Requirements for Surface Parking Areas. Building sites incorporating surface parking lots shall include at least 15 percent of the site area in landscaping. Landscaping shall be distributed along all street frontages and pedestrian walkways that are adjacent to parking areas to help screen parked automobiles from view. Plant species and/or planters should be designed to achieve a height of at least five feet above the surface of the parking lot except where this would conflict with safe visibility or good site design. Landscaping shall also be provided within the interior of surface lots to break up large expanses of paving. Parking lots with four or more vehicles shall provide interior landscaping of at least 10 square feet per vehicle. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.34.090 Landscaping Standards for Overlay Districts.
A. Beach Overlay and Park Overlay District. The following standards apply to the park overlay district.

1. New native trees or other significant native vegetation shall be planted between the buildings on the site and the adjoining parklands when such vegetation would enhance the visual resources of the park by screening the buildings from public view, and when there is adequate space available to make such landscaping practical.

2. At least 75 percent of all landscaped areas on the property visible from the park shall be planted with drought-tolerant and/or native species. Areas of the site adjacent to parklands shall be landscaped and designed to establish a natural transition to the parkland vegetation. Trees approved for removal shall be replaced by two or more native specimen trees listed in the forest management plan preferably on-site or, if necessary, in the adjoining park as determined by the City Forester. Invasive species shall be removed if currently established.

B. ESHA Overlay District. Landscaping plans for projects in the ESHA overlay district shall provide for native vegetation restoration consistent with performance criteria established in the biological resources report required in CMC 17.20.220(D). The plan shall also be consistent with all standards set forth in CMC 17.20.220, Environmentally Sensitive Habitats. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.010 Purpose.
Much of Carmel’s charm and uniqueness comes from the variety in design of its buildings. Many of its older buildings, although nonconforming, add to this overall charm and unique quality. The loss of such buildings could have a detrimental effect on the overall character of the City. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate nonconforming buildings and nonconforming uses and to provide for the elimination of nonconformity, where its elimination will not have a detrimental effect on the City’s unique charm and the overall village character of the City. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.020 Continuation and Maintenance.
A. A building or structure that was lawfully established, but does not conform to existing zoning regulations, shall be deemed a nonconforming structure and may be used and maintained as provided in this chapter. (For structural nonconformance, see CMC Title 15 and the Uniform Building Code.)

B. Occupancies and uses lawfully established that do not conform with the current use regulations, site area requirements, or dwelling unit densities in the district where the use is located may be continued, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

C. Any lawfully established use, building or structure that is nonconforming solely by reason of the absence of an administrative permit or use permit may be changed to a conforming use, building or structure by issuance of an appropriate administrative permit or a use permit, in compliance with this title. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.030 Alterations and Enlargements of Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.
A. A lawful nonconforming structure may be maintained, repaired, or altered as long as such maintenance, repair, or alteration does not increase the nonconformity and all work performed conforms to all of the requirements of this chapter. Alterations and additions to buildings and structures subject to Chapter 17.32 CMC, Historic Preservation, shall conform to the requirements of that chapter.

B. Alterations, repairs or remodeling that enlarge, extend or increase a nonconforming feature of a building shall be prohibited, except as provided in CMC 17.32.100(D) for historic resources. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.040 Destruction and Reconstruction of Nonconforming Buildings.
A. Nonconforming buildings or structures that are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, acts of God, or acts of the public enemy to an extent of 75 percent or less of the value of the structure as determined by the Building Official may be reestablished to the size and extent to which it previously existed providing a building permit is obtained from the Building Official within 30 months of the date of damage or destruction and is completed in conformance with the current, applicable Uniform Building Code and City building ordinances.

B. Nonconforming buildings or structures that are damaged or destroyed in excess of 75 percent as indicated above may be reestablished providing a use permit is issued by the Planning Commission, based on findings in CMC 17.64.130 and the plans for the project are approved by the Planning Commission.

C. It is recognized that compliance with CMC Title 15 and the Uniform Building Codes dealing with construction may alter to some extent existing buildings. Where this occurs, such changes are subject to design review and may be made providing the design or construction is not altered in a manner that conflicts with the City’s zoning standards and design guidelines and nonconformities shall not be increased.

D. The demolition of any nonconforming building or structure shall require that all new construction on the site meet all requirements for new buildings and structures.

E. The substantial alteration of any nonconforming building or structure, that includes removal of any nonconforming building element or structural element, shall require correction of that specific nonconforming building element or structural element in conformance with all requirements for new construction. The removed nonconformity shall not be rebuilt or reestablished at that location on the site or elsewhere on the site. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.050 Nonconforming Uses.
A. No building that contains a nonconforming use shall be enlarged by increasing the floor area or building envelope or exterior volume. Repairs, remodeling, alterations or maintenance, in any 12-month period, shall be limited to 10 percent of the value of the building, or 10 percent of the value of the portion of the building containing the nonconforming use. The value of improvements shall be determined by the Building Official.

B. No nonconforming use may be expanded or extended into an existing portion of a building that was not previously occupied by the same nonconforming use.

C. A commercial use that is otherwise allowed within a district but is nonconforming due to noncompliance with one or more operational standards for approval (e.g., hours, type of merchandise, etc.) shall require that any replacement use comply with all operational standards for approval upon change of ownership. A use that is nonconforming due to physical or structural standards (e.g., floor area, number of parking spaces, etc.) shall not be required to conform upon change of ownership of the use.

D. A new building constructed on premises containing a nonconforming use shall only be used or occupied by a use permitted in the district in which the building is located.

E. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any building that contains a lawful nonconforming dwelling unit in any commercial or R-4 district. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.36.060 Abandonment of Use.
Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the provisions of the code, such part of the building, structure or land shall not thereafter be used or occupied by a nonconforming use, even though the building may have been originally designed and constructed for the prior nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure or part thereof has been discontinued for a period of six consecutive months, such use shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished, and the use of the building, part of the building, structure or land thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district wherein the site of the use lies. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS1
Sections:

17.38.010    Purpose.

17.38.050    Miscellaneous Regulations from Other Titles.

17.38.060    Parking Programs.

17.38.010 Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to require off-street parking for vehicles to lessen the parking congestion on the public streets and to leave street parking available to persons making short-term visits to the commercial district for shopping, business or related activities. The provisions of this chapter are intended to:

A. Provide clear standards for parking requirements.

B. Provide parking requirements that are appropriate for specified land uses.

C. Provide for flexibility in meeting parking requirements.

D. Ensure that parking requirements are consistent with the land use goals of the community.

E. Discourage unnecessary curb cuts and the loss of street parking spaces through the construction of driveways downtown. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.38.020 General Requirements.
Table A of this section establishes the minimum parking requirements for all uses, projects, developments and redevelopments. New projects or developments shall only be allowed when meeting all parking requirements of this chapter and the requirements of any use permit, subdivision approval or specific plan applicable to the property. Proposed uses within existing buildings may replace existing uses as long as any existing parking deficiencies on the property are not increased by the replacement. Proposed additions of floor area, new shops or dwelling units, or other similar changes in land use resulting in a net increase in parking requirements, as set forth in this chapter, shall provide all required parking generated by the new activities on the site.

Whenever a proposed activity requires the provision of additional parking spaces, the City shall establish a record for the property listing the number of spaces required by the proposed change and the manner in which the increased parking requirements has been satisfied. Required off-street parking may be satisfied by providing parking on- or off-site, unless otherwise prohibited in this chapter. To avoid double-counting, spaces used to satisfy the parking requirements of one property development shall not be used by another property development to satisfy its parking requirements.

Any proposed new buildings, or any substantial replacement or reconstruction of a demolished building, as defined in CMC 17.70.020, shall provide all parking required by the provisions of this chapter. Replacement or reconstruction shall be deemed substantial if the value of the new construction equals or exceeds 50 percent of the construction value of the existing building.

A. Explanation of Minimum Parking Table.

1. Table A establishes the minimum amount of parking required for most land uses and land use districts. The Planning Commission shall review proposed projects for their anticipated parking demand and may require additional parking through use permit conditions if substantial evidence supports the need for providing parking beyond the minimum standard.

2. When the symbol N/A appears in the table, the land use specified in that row is not an allowed use within the land use district corresponding to that column. Existing legal nonconforming uses within these N/A categories shall not be increased or enlarged in any manner that would result in a need for increased parking spaces using the “Basis for Requirement” listed in the table.

3. When evaluating parking requirements for such nonconforming uses, the parking requirement shall be the same as the maximum requirement applicable in any land use district in which the land use is allowed and for which parking is required.

B. Fractional Spaces.

1. When parking is to be physically provided on-site or off-site and a determination of the minimum required parking for the project or use results in one or more full spaces plus a fraction of an additional parking space, one full space shall be provided for the fractional space or the fractional space shall be met through fractional in-lieu payments as set forth below.

2. When parking requirements are met through the payment of in-lieu fees, or a combination of in-lieu fees and off-street parking, and a determination of the minimum required parking results in one or more full spaces plus a fraction of an additional parking space, the in-lieu payment shall include one full fee for each one full space plus a fractional fee proportional to the fractional space.

C. Minimum Off-Street Parking. It is recognized that providing parking on some sites will result in the loss of existing or potential on-street parking spaces due to the location of driveways or other improvements. Therefore, off-street parking shall only be allowed when the cumulative effect of providing such parking will result in a net gain of total parking spaces. When any determination of the minimum required parking for a project or use results in a need for only one space, and parking is being physically provided off-street, two full spaces shall be required unless the applicant can demonstrate a reconfiguration of on-street spaces, consistent with guidelines maintained by the Department of Public Works for street parking, that yields a net gain in total available parking when only one off-street space is provided.

D. Properties Located in More Than One District. For projects located on property falling within two or more land use districts with different parking standards, the parking requirement shall be determined by using the parking standards applicable to that portion of the development lying within each of the land use districts involved.

E. Design Standards. The following standards shall apply to all surface and underground parking designs:

1. Dimensions.

a. Standard Spaces: nine feet by 19 feet.

b. Compact Spaces: eight and one-half feet by 16 feet.

c. For all parking designs with parking spaced perpendicular to vehicle travel lanes, a minimum of 24 feet shall be provided for automobile backup room behind standard spaces and 18 feet behind compact spaces. Design shall minimize the need for multiple or complex turning movements. Where angled parking is used, the minimum backup room shall be that distance specified in the current edition of Architectural Graphic Standards.

2. Compact Ratio. Compact spaces may constitute 50 percent of the total required spaces. All spaces provided in excess of the minimum requirements may be compact spaces.

3. Driveways. Driveways shall be located to preserve as much on-street curb parking as possible. Driveways and other improvements on the property shall be designed for safe and unobstructed visibility of pedestrians and automobile traffic both on and off the site.

4. Design Review. All parking, whether on-site or off-site shall be subject to design review in conformance with Chapter 17.58 CMC, Design Review, and all provisions of this chapter.

F. Surface Parking Design. The following standards apply to the design of surface parking in addition to those required by subsection (E) of this section:

1. Setbacks. Surface parking spaces shall not be constructed within required setback areas. Portions of rear or side setback areas may be used for backup movements as long as the majority of the setback is landscaped.

G. Underground Parking Design. The standards in subsection (H) of this section apply to underground parking garages in addition to those required by subsection (E) of this section.

H. Standards.

1. Height. For that portion of an underground garage facing any public street, way, place or park, the maximum height of the finished floor level above an underground parking garage shall not be greater than five feet above the existing grade or the official street grade whichever measurement results in the lesser height. The maximum height of the finished floor level above an underground garage shall not be greater than eight feet above the surface of the ground adjacent to any exterior wall around the full perimeter of the garage. Garages not meeting these two standards shall be counted as a story.

2. Setbacks. Underground parking garages may be constructed within required setbacks if significant trees will not be removed or injured and the setback can still be effectively landscaped. Underground garage designs should provide sufficient room around the perimeter to accommodate existing and new tree root systems.

3. Driveways. The grade of driveways providing access to underground garages shall not exceed five percent in the first 10 feet of the driveway slope near the entry and shall not exceed 10 percent in the last 10 feet near the level of the garage floor. The intervening grade shall not exceed 25 percent. Driveway designs shall provide sufficient area to allow drivers to view automobile and pedestrian traffic before merging into such traffic.

4. Ventilation and Access. Garages shall be ventilated to avoid the buildup of exhaust gases. When mechanical ventilation is used, noise mitigation measures shall be incorporated such as low-noise fans, insulated ductwork and vibration absorbing mounting systems. Ducts shall not exhaust toward any openings or open space on any adjoining property nor toward any on-site or off-site way, street, place or park accessible to the public. Plans for underground garages shall be reviewed to ensure accessibility for Police and Fire Department personnel during emergencies. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.38.030 Exceptions.
It is recognized that some sites, due to size, shape, topography, existing buildings, the availability of land suitable for parking purposes or location within specific land use districts, may have difficulty meeting all parking requirements. Therefore, the following exceptions are provided to increase the flexibility in meeting parking requirements:

A. On-Site Parking in the Central Commercial (CC) Land Use District. In contrast to the other districts within the City, on-site parking is prohibited in the central commercial (CC) land use district. This policy eliminates the need for curb cuts in sidewalks and the interference with free pedestrian traffic flow that would result from an excessive number of driveways. This policy is also intended to enhance the opportunities for creating intra-block courts and walkways between properties and buildings.

B. Use of Another Site. Parking requirements may be fulfilled by supplying the required parking on another site upon approval of a use permit. When use of another site for parking is authorized, such parking shall be located within the commercial district on property permitting such use. The land area required to provide such parking shall be legally committed for the full life of the structure for which the parking is required. The legal commitment shall be of such a nature that it cannot be withdrawn for the life of the structure, without the consent of the City. Applicants applying for approval of a use permit authorizing the use of another site for parking purposes must demonstrate one of the following conditions:

1. The property owners of two or more adjacent properties have proposed a combined development plan to provide the required parking for their properties, in accordance with the parking standards established in this chapter, on part of the several sites involved.

2. The project site for which the parking requirement applies is 5,000 square feet or less in size and has less than 50 feet of street frontage.

3. The construction of required driveway(s) for on-site parking would result in the excessive loss of curb parking on street.

4. The topography, size, shape or peculiar conditions of the site or the existing development on the site would make the provision of on-site parking impractical.

5. The site for which parking is required is located within the central commercial (CC) land use district where on-site parking is prohibited.

C. Parking Adjustment In-Lieu Fees. The Planning Commission may authorize the satisfaction of parking requirements through the granting of a use permit and the payment of in-lieu fees when on-site parking is not practical or when on-site parking is prohibited by City policies. Parking adjustments shall not decrease the number of parking spaces required by this chapter. The practicality of providing parking on-site shall be evaluated by using the criteria set forth in subsection (B)(2) through (B)(4) of this section. Standards for participation in the in-lieu fee program are established in CMC 17.38.040, Parking In-Lieu Fee Program. Applicants for use permits authorizing the use of in-lieu fees to adjust on-site parking shall also demonstrate both of the following:

1. The parking for which the adjustment is sought is not required for serving hotel or motel uses.

2. The applicant has diligently pursued meeting the parking requirements both on-site and off-site, but has been unsuccessful in meeting the requirement, or that the site is located within the central commercial (CC) land use district where on-site parking is prohibited. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.38.040 Parking In-Lieu Fee Program.
When parking adjustments have been authorized by the Planning Commission in conformance with CMC 17.38.030(C), required parking may be satisfied by the payment to the City of in-lieu fees. Funds collected by the City from such payments shall be deposited in a specific fund and used by the City to acquire and/or develop off-street parking. Such parking shall be available to the public and shall be in or near the business district of the City. Funds paid to the City for in-lieu parking shall not be refundable in the event of destruction or removal of the structure or land use for which the funds were paid, but shall run with the land. The City shall maintain a record of all spaces credited to each property including all spaces paid through in-lieu fees, spaces physically provided on each property and all spaces represented by the existing parking nonconformity on each site.

A. Payment of In-Lieu Fees. All in-lieu parking fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the first permit (any business license or building permit) for which the in-lieu fees are required with one exception. The only exception arises when the number of in-lieu parking spaces exceeds five, in which case at least 40 percent of the total in-lieu fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the project permit or license and the remaining balance shall accrue interest at the prime interest rate fixed on the date the first permit or license is issued. Any fees, including interest that will be subject to such delayed payments shall be evidenced by a promissory note. This promissory note shall provide for the payment of attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party and shall be secured by a deed of trust.

B. Determination of Value of Parking In-Lieu Fees. The amount to be charged for an in-lieu parking space shall be determined by using the current construction costs of public garages having Type I or Type II fire resistance and the regional modifier for the San Francisco area as supplied by the “Building Standards” of the International Conference of Building Officials and a factor representing land costs. Four hundred square feet shall be used as the necessary area for a car to park and have maneuvering room with ingress and egress. The current construction costs per square foot shall be multiplied by the modifier to determine the cost per square foot to construct the parking space. The cost of constructing the parking space shall then be increased by 50 percent to reflect land cost. This total shall be the fee paid for each full in-lieu parking space. A fee reduction of 25 percent shall be allowed for parking spaces required for newly established residential dwelling units. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.38.050 Miscellaneous Regulations from Other Titles.
A. Unlawful Acts. It is unlawful for any person to park or permit to be parked any vehicle, pushcart or other contrivance within the City on any street, parking area, park or other public land or area within the City, under the following conditions:

1. Parking in Parkways. To park any vehicle in any park, parkway, greenbelt, planting area or sidewalk area within the City except within parking areas specifically designated as such by the City Council.

2. Parking on Certain Streets. To park or permit to be parked on any portion of Ocean Avenue west of San Antonio, Del Mar Avenue, and Scenic Road any vehicle exceeding 12,000 pounds gross weight or exceeding 20 feet in length overall, including bumpers, or exceeding seven and one-half feet in height at its highest point, except when engaged in the loading or unloading of passengers or goods as may otherwise be permitted by law. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.38.060 Parking Programs.
Enactment and/or implementation of any parking program that has the potential to limit or restrict free public parking within the City shall require a coastal development permit. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.40.080    Removal of Abandoned Signs.

17.40.010 Purpose.
Signs are instrumental in maintaining the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s village character. The City has no house numbering system so residents often place signs outside their homes for identification. Business signs typically are made of wood and are oriented toward the pedestrian rather than the automobile. These residential and business signs create a unique village environment, which encourages exploration and discovery.

This chapter establishes standards and guidelines to preserve and enhance the appearance of the community as a place in which to live and work. These standards and guidelines ensure that signage is used as identification and not as advertisement or a notice-attracting device. Furthermore, these standards prevent the installation of an excessive number of signs, avoid visual clutter and eliminate hazards to pedestrians and motorists brought about by distracting signs.

The sign standards also implement the following objectives and policies of the General Plan:

O1-17:

Maintain diligent control over signs and other advertising or notice-attracting facilities in order to avoid unsightly, bizarre, and/or out-of-scale visual impacts, including exterior lighting and lights from window displays.

P1-53:

At least once each year the Director shall report to the Planning Commission on the business signs, directories, menu boxes and take-away menu holders that have been approved through the administrative process.

B. Planning Commission Approval. Signs which, in the opinion of the Director, require exception from the standards described in this chapter shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission also shall review all business signs painted, etched or otherwise applied to glass, all signs made of plastics, fabric or imitation wood and all signs of architectural, cultural, and historical significance. The Commission may grant exceptions only to the number, location and design of business signs. The following criteria must be satisfied to grant the exception:

1. Number. Additional business signs may be permitted in unusual circumstances such as, but not limited to, a business that has entrances on two different public rights-of-way.

2. Location. Signs shall clearly identify the business entrance. Signs shall be pedestrian-oriented except for gas stations and motels that are recognized by the City as predominantly vehicle-oriented business. Clutter from business signs at street frontages shall be avoided. Sign clutter along street frontages from multiple businesses within a courtyard or building shall be avoided.

3. Design. Any exceptions to design standards shall retain compatibility with the design, color, and scale of the building.

C. No Permit Required. The following signs on private property do not require a permit if they meet the purpose, objectives, and standards in this chapter as determined by the Director: interior signs, alarm system identification signs, house/occupant name, no soliciting/no handbills, garage/rummage/estate sale, home business, public information signs (exit, restroom, elevator, etc.) and a variety of temporary signs as identified in this chapter. Signs which, in the opinion of the Director, are out of the ordinary or which do not meet the purpose, objectives and standards of this chapter shall be removed or referred to the Planning Commission for review.

STORMWATER QUALITY AND UTILITY
Sections:

17.42.010    Purpose.

17.42.020    Urban Runoff Water Quality and Discharge Management.

17.42.010 Purpose.
The provisions of this chapter are intended to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens, and protect and enhance the water quality of watercourses and water bodies in compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) by reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable, by prohibiting nonstormwater discharges to the storm drain system, and by managing the City’s storm and surface water drainage system. Requirements of this chapter shall be implemented and enforced in accordance with the schedule adopted as part of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System Phase II permit (NPDES). (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.42.020 Urban Runoff Water Quality and Discharge Management.
A. Applicability. This section shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands within the City.

B. Administration.

1. Responsibility for Administration. The Public Works Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this section. Any powers granted to or duties of the Public Works Director may be delegated in writing by the Public Works Director to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the City.

2. Regulatory Consistency. This section shall be construed to ensure consistency with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and Porter-Cologne Act, and statutes and regulations that amend or supplement those Acts.

3. Ultimate Responsibility of Discharger. The requirements of this section are minimum standards; therefore this section does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. caused by that person. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City, or any agent or employee of the City, for any damages that result from any discharger’s reliance on this section or any administrative decision in compliance with this section.

C. Discharge Prohibitions.

1. General Prohibition. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including pollutants or waters containing any pollutants, that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any other discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited, except for the following.

a. Certain types of discharges will not be considered a source of pollutants to the storm drain system and to waters of the U.S. when properly managed in a manner approved by the Director of Public Works to ensure that no potential pollutants are present, and therefore are not considered illegal discharges unless determined to cause a violation of the provisions of the Porter-Cologne Act, Clean Water Act, or other provisions of this section. These types of discharges are listed in Section 1.6 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to Chapter 17.43 CMC.

b. This prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered by the State of California under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted by the City for any discharge to the storm drain system.

c. With the written concurrence of the Regional Board, the City may grant a written exemption for other specific nonstormwater discharges which are not a source of pollutants to the storm drain system nor the waters of the U.S. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (E)(1) of this section, Authority to Inspect, the Public Works Director may require by written notice that a person responsible for an illegal discharge immediately, or by a specified date, discontinue the discharge and, if necessary, take measures to eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of future illegal discharges.

2. Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.

a. The Public Works Director may require by written notice that a person responsible for an illicit connection to the storm drain system comply with the requirements of this section to eliminate or secure approval for the connection by a specified date.

b. If, subsequent to eliminating a connection found to be in violation of this section, the responsible person can demonstrate that an illegal discharge will no longer occur, the person may request City approval to reconnect. The reconnection or reinstallation of the connection shall be at the expense of the responsible person.

3. Waste Disposal. No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, keep, or permit to be thrown, deposited, left, or maintained, in or upon any public or private property, driveway, parking area, street, alley, sidewalk, component of the storm drain system, or water of the U.S., any liquids, powders, refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles, and accumulations, so that they may cause or contribute to water pollution. Wastes deposited in proper waste receptacles for the purposes of collection are exempted from this prohibition.

4. Discharges in Violation of Industrial or Construction Activity NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of the permit. Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Public Works Director prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, or development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause.

D. Regulations and Requirements.

1. Prevention, Control, and Reduction of Stormwater Pollutants.

a. Authorization to Adopt and Impose Best Management Practices. The City will adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMP) for activities, operations, or facilities which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. These are contained in the BMP Guidance Series in Appendix J to Chapter 17.43 CMC. Where best management practices requirements are promulgated by the City or any Federal, State of California, or regional agency for any activity, operation, or facility which would otherwise cause the discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system or water of the U.S., every person undertaking such activity or operation, or owning or operating such facility shall comply with such requirements. The Public Works Director will periodically report to the City Council on the status of implementation of BMPs and any new BMPs that are expected to be developed for inclusion in the BMP Guidance Series. In the event more restrictive requirements pertaining to new development and redevelopment are contained in the City’s Low Impact Development Guidance Manual than are contained in the BMP Guidance Series, the more restrictive requirements contained in the Low Impact Development Guidance Manual will govern.

b. New Development and Redevelopment. The City shall adopt Low Impact Development (LID) requirements identifying appropriate best management practices to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation, transport and discharge of pollutants as defined by Chapter 17.43 CMC. The LID requirements of this chapter are general in nature. More detailed requirements, some of which are in addition to those contained in this Chapter, are contained in the City’s Low Impact Development Guidance Manual (LID Guidance Manual) in Appendix I to Chapter 17.43 CMC. Persons or entities undertaking or owning new development and/or redevelopment projects shall comply with the requirements in the CMC and in the LID Guidance Manual. The Public Works Director will periodically report to the City Council on the status of implementation of LID requirements and new LID requirements that are expected to be developed for inclusion in the LID Guidance Manual.

The City shall incorporate these requirements in any land use entitlement and construction or building-related permit to be issued for the development or redevelopment and the Director shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of Chapter 17.43 CMC.

c. Responsibility to Implement Best Management Practices. Notwithstanding the presence or absence of requirements promulgated in compliance with subsections (D)(1)(a) and (D)(1)(b) of this section, any person engaged in activities or operations, or owning facilities or property which will or may result in pollutants entering stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. shall implement best management practices to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the Director of Public Works to prevent and reduce the pollutants.

i. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide to the maximum extent practicable protection, as determined by the Director, from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses.

ii. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes shall be provided and maintained at the owner or operator’s expense.

iii. Best management practices required by the City can be obtained from the Public Works Department or the Community Planning and Building Department.

2. Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or the person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, stagnant pools of water and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse to the extent required by the Director of Public Works. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. The owner or lessee shall not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary for maintenance, nor remove said vegetation in such a manner as to increase the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is within their property lines to protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse on site and downstream. Property owners shall select “soft engineered” techniques when possible for maintaining and stabilizing stream banks.

3. Remediation. Whenever the Public Works Director finds that a discharge of pollutants is taking place or has occurred which will result in or has resulted in pollution of stormwater, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S., the Public Works Director may require by written notice to the owner of the property and/or the responsible person that the pollution be remediated and the affected property restored within a specified time in compliance with subsection (F) of this section, Enforcement.

E. Inspection and Monitoring.

1. Authority to Inspect. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any provision of this section, or whenever the Public Works Director has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this section, the Director may enter such premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same and to inspect and copy records related to stormwater compliance. In the event the owner or occupant refuses entry after a request to enter and inspect has been made, the City is hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry.

2. Authority to Sample, Establish Sampling Devices, and Test. During any inspection in compliance with this section, the Public Works Director may take any samples and perform any testing deemed necessary to aid in the pursuit of the inquiry or to record site activities.

F. Enforcement.

1. Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. A violation of or failure to comply with any of the requirements of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor. Such persons may also be in violation of the Clean Water Act and/or the Porter-Cologne Act and may be subject to the sanctions of those acts including civil and criminal penalties. Any enforcement action authorized under this section may also include written notice to the violator of this potential liability.

2. Notice of Violation. Whenever the Public Works Director finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, the Public Works Director may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. The notice may require without limitation:

a. The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

b. The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

c. That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;

d. The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;

e. Payment of compensation to cover administrative and remediation costs;

f. The implementation or maintenance of source control or treatment BMPs;

g. Payment of a fine as determined by action of the City Council.

If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which remediation or restoration must be completed. The notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by the City or a contractor designated by the Public Works Director, with the cost of the work charged to the violator in compliance with subsection (F)(4) of this section, Emergency Abatement by City.

3. Appeal. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (F)(4) of this section, Emergency Abatement by City, any person receiving a notice of violation in compliance with subsection (F)(2) of this section, Notice of Violation, may appeal the determination of the Public Works Director to the City Administrator. The notice of appeal must be received by the City Administrator within five days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the City Administrator or his/her designee shall take place within 15 days from the date of City’s receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the City Administrator or designee shall be final.

4. Emergency Abatement by City. If the violation has not been corrected in compliance with the requirements in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal in compliance with subsection (F)(3) of this section, within 10 days of the decision of the City Administrator upholding the decision of the Public Works Director, then the City or a contractor designated by the Public Works Director may enter upon the subject private property and is authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the City or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

5. Charging Cost of Abatement/Liens. Within 30 days after abatement of the nuisance by the City, the Public Works Director shall notify the property owner of the property of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment with the City Clerk within 15 days. The City Clerk shall set the matter for public hearing by the City Council. The decision of the Council shall be set forth by resolution and shall be final.

If the amount due is not paid within 10 days of the decision of the Council or the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal under this section, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. A copy of the resolution shall be turned over to the County Auditor so that the Auditor may enter the amounts of the assessment against the parcel as it appears on the current assessment roll, and the tax collector shall include the amount of the assessment on the bill. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.010 Purpose and Intent.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and enhance coastal waters within the City of Carmel in accordance with the policies of the City’s Local Coastal Plan (Sections O5-45 and O5-46), Sections 30230, 30231, 30232 and 30240 of the California Coastal Act, and the City’s Phase II NPDES permit requirements. To implement the certified land use plan, application submittal requirements, development standards, and other measures are provided to ensure that permitted development shall be sited and designed to conserve natural drainage features and vegetation, minimize the introduction of pollutants into coastal waters to the maximum extent practicable, limit the discharge of stormwater runoff, and protect the overall quality of coastal waters and resources. All new development and redevelopment within the City shall comply with the requirements in this Chapter and in the City’s Low Impact Development Guidance Manual (LID Guidance Manual) in Appendix I to this chapter. (See Chapter 17.42 CMC and CMC 17.42.020(D)(1)(b).)

B. The intent of this chapter is to address the following principles:

1. All development shall be evaluated by the Planning Director or his/her designee for potential adverse impacts to water quality and applicants should consider site design, source control and treatment control BMPs in order to minimize polluted runoff and water quality impacts resulting from the development. Site design BMPs reduce the need for source and/or treatment control BMPs, and source control BMPs may reduce the amount of treatment control BMPs needed for a development. Therefore, BMPs should be incorporated into the project design in the following progression:

a. Site design BMPs;

b. Source control BMPs;

c. Treatment control BMPs.

2. All development shall be designed to minimize the introduction of pollutants that may result in water quality impacts. Projects should be designed to control post-development peak runoff rates and average volumes to maintain or reduce pre-development downstream erosion rates. These objectives can be accomplished through the creation of a hydrologically functional project design that strives to mimic the existing natural hydrologic regime and by achieving the following goals:

a. Maintain and use existing natural drainage courses and vegetation;

b. Conserve natural resources and areas by clustering development on the least environmentally sensitive portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural, undisturbed condition;

c. Minimize the amount of directly connected impervious surface and total area of impervious surface;

d. Incorporate or connect to existing on-site retention and infiltration measures;

e. Direct rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than driveways or impervious surfaces to reduce the amount of stormwater leaving the site;

f. Minimize clearing and grading.

3. Incorporating these goals and principles into the project design will help to minimize the introduction of pollutants to the site and decrease the amount of polluted runoff leaving the site, resulting in the overall objective of water quality protection. Appendix I to this chapter describes the requirements and processes for implementing BMPs into development and provides examples of types of BMPs to incorporate.

4. Nonstructural BMPs are preventative actions that involve management and source controls such as protecting and restoring sensitive areas such as wetlands and riparian corridors, maintaining and/or increasing open space, providing buffers along sensitive water bodies, minimizing impervious surfaces and directly connected impervious areas, and minimizing disturbance of soils and vegetation. Structural BMPs include: storage practices such as wet ponds and extended-detention outlet structures; filtration practices such as grassed swales, sand filters and filter strips; and infiltration practices such as infiltration basins and infiltration trenches. In many cases combinations of nonstructural and structural measures will be required to reduce water quality impacts.

5. Nonstructural and structural BMPs most applicable to the development projects are included in “A Planner’s Guide to Conditions of Approval and Standard Mitigation Measures.” Additional guidance on best management practices is available from the State, the EPA and from other sources such as BASMAA “Starting at the Source.” Stormwater technologies are constantly being improved, and staff and developers must be responsive to any changes, developments or improvements in control technologies. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.020 Applicability.
All properties within the City of Carmel are located within the coastal zone as defined in the California Coastal Act and are subject to the policies, standards and provisions contained in the certified LCP that may apply. Where any standard provided in this chapter conflicts with any other policy or standard contained in the City’s General Plan, Zoning Code or other City-adopted plan, resolution or ordinance not included in the certified Carmel LCP, and it is not possible for the development to comply with both the Carmel LCP and other plans, resolutions or ordinances, the policies, standards or provisions of the LCP shall take precedence consistent with the hierarchy established in CMC 17.02.090. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.030 Application Submittal Requirements.
A. For all projects requiring implementation of an erosion and drainage control plan (subsection (A)(1) of this section), water quality mitigation plan (subsection (D) of this section), or stormwater management plan, the following information shall be submitted with an application for a coastal development permit according to the requirements listed below.

1. Construction Phase Requirements – Erosion and Drainage Control Plan. All development permit applications involving alterations to existing buildings or site design, or construction of new buildings that meet the criteria below shall include a site-specific erosion and drainage control plan. Plans shall be required for new development that (a) increases site coverage by more than five percent of the site area, or (b) involves grading that will affect drainage patterns on or off the site, or (c) involves either a rebuild or construction of a new building. The erosion and drainage control plan shall include a site specific erosion control plan that includes controls on grading (i.e., timing and amounts), best management practice for staging, storage, and disposal of construction materials, design specification of sedimentation basins and landscaping/revegetation of graded or disturbed areas. The plans shall also include as site specific polluted runoff control plan that demonstrates how runoff will be diverted from impermeable surfaces into permeable areas of the property in a nonerosive manner and filter and infiltrate stormwater prior to conveyance off-site.

2. Post-Construction Phase Requirements – Site Design and Source Control Measures. Post-construction plans detailing how stormwater and polluted runoff will be managed or mitigated should be included in the design of all projects that require an erosion and drainage control plan (subsection (A)(1) of this section). Project submittals shall include details regarding how the project will use appropriate site design and source control BMPs to minimize adverse effects of the project on water quality.

3. Water Quality Mitigation Plan. For development which does not mitigate impacts to water quality using site design and source control measures and for certain special categories of development (see subsection (E) of this section) a water quality mitigation plan will be required showing how treatment control (or structural) BMPs will be used (in addition to site design and source control BMPs) to minimize the discharge of polluted runoff from the project.

B. All development that requires an erosion and drainage control plan shall require the implementation of appropriate site design and source control BMPs from subsection (D) of this section and Section 3.0 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter to minimize post-construction polluted runoff. The project plans submitted with the permit application should also specify any treatment control or structural BMPs that the applicant elects to include in the development to minimize post-construction polluted runoff, and include the operation and maintenance plans for these BMPs.

C. Less Than Significant Impacts. The following land uses and projects are generally presumed to have a less than significant project-specific water quality impact. These include redevelopment projects that reduce the amount of impervious surfaces on the site, do not change the land use or potential pollutants and are not one of the categories of development requiring a WQMP; and new development and redevelopment projects that incorporate into the project design construction BMPs for erosion, sediment and construction waste control and incorporate post-construction BMPs to protect sensitive riparian or wetland resources, reduce the quantity of runoff, and treat runoff generated by the project to pre-project levels.

D. Post-Construction Phase Requirements – Water Quality Mitigation Plan. Plans detailing how stormwater and polluted runoff will be managed or mitigated will be required for all projects that require an erosion and drainage control plan. The basic design elements for all projects (see subsection (B) of this section) will demonstrate how the project will use appropriate site design and source control BMPs to minimize adverse effects of the project on water quality. For certain categories of development a water quality mitigation plan will be required showing how treatment control (or structural) BMPs will be used (in addition to site design and source control BMPs) to minimize the discharge of polluted runoff from the project.

A water quality mitigation plan (WQMP) shall be required for all development that requires an erosion and drainage control plan and either fails to address water quality impact using site design and source control measures or is in a category of development identified below. In addition to the site design and source control BMPs required for a stormwater management plan, the WQMP shall include treatment control (or structural) BMPs identified in Section 4.0 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter to minimize post-construction polluted runoff. The WQMP shall also include the operation and maintenance plans for these BMPs.

E. Special Categories of Development. A WQMP shall be required for projects that fall into one or more of the following categories of development and are not able to meet the appropriate treatment controls for the specific pollutants associated with those development types as set forth in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter as part of the design:

1. Industrial/commercial development;

2. Restaurants;

3. Retail gasoline outlets/automotive service facilities;

4. Parking lots (5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area or with 25 or more parking spaces)/outdoor storage areas;

5. Projects that discharge to an environmentally sensitive area (ESA) or coastal water. Such projects are defined as being all development and redevelopment located within or directly adjacent to or discharging directly to an environmentally sensitive area (where discharges from the development or redevelopment will enter receiving waters within the environmentally sensitive area). “Directly adjacent” means situated within 200 feet of the environmentally sensitive area. “Discharging directly to” means outflow from a drainage conveyance system that is composed entirely of flows from the subject development or redevelopment site, and not commingled with flows from adjacent lands.

F. CEQA. Provisions of this section shall be complementary to, and shall not replace, any applicable requirements for stormwater mitigation required under the California Environmental Quality Act or Chapter 17.42 CMC. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.040 BMP Maintenance and Conditions of Transfer.
All applicants shall provide verification of maintenance provisions for structural and treatment control BMPs, including but not limited to legal agreements, covenants, CEQA mitigation requirements, and conditional use permits. Verification at a minimum shall include:

A. The developer’s signed statement accepting responsibility for maintenance until the responsibility is legally transferred; and either

B. A signed statement from the public entity assuming responsibility for structural and treatment control BMP maintenance and that it meets all local agency design standards; or

C. Written conditions in the sales or lease agreement, which require the recipient to assume responsibility for maintenance and conduct a maintenance inspection at least once a year; or

D. Written text in project conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CCRs) for residential properties assigning maintenance responsibilities to the homeowners association for maintenance of the structural and treatment control BMPs; or

E. Any other legally enforceable agreement that assigns responsibility for the maintenance of post-construction structural and treatment control BMPs. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.050 Water Quality Checklist.
A water quality checklist will be developed by the City and used to supplement the CEQA checklist in the permit review process to assess potential water quality impacts and appropriate mitigation measures. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.060 Development Standards.
A. BMP Requirements and Implementation. All development shall be evaluated for potential adverse impacts to water quality and the applicant shall consider site design, source control and treatment control BMPs in order to minimize polluted runoff and water quality impacts resulting from the development. A SWMP requires the implementation of site design and source control BMPs, as specified in CMC 17.43.030(B), and a WQMP requires the implementation of site design, source control and treatment control BMPs, as specified in CMC 17.43.030(C). In order to maximize the reduction of water quality impacts, BMPs should be incorporated into the project design in the following progression: (1) site design BMPs, (2) source control BMPs, and (3) treatment control BMPs. Examples of these BMPs can be found in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter.

B. BMP Selection Process. In selecting BMPs to incorporate into the project design, the applicant should first identify the pollutants of concern that are anticipated to be generated as a result of the development. The City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter should be used as a guide in identifying these pollutants of concern. Pollutants generated by the development that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics shall be considered primary pollutants of concern:

1. Current loadings or historical deposits of the pollutant are impairing the beneficial uses of a receiving water.

2. Elevated levels of the pollutant are found in water or sediments of a receiving water and/or have the potential to be toxic to or bioaccumulate in organisms therein.

3. Inputs of the pollutant are at a level high enough to be considered potentially toxic.

Site design and source control BMPs are required based on pollutants commonly associated with the project type, as identified in Tables 1 and 2 of Attachment 3 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter. BMPs that minimize the identified pollutants of concern may be selected from the examples in Table 3 of Attachment 3 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter and CMC 17.43.070, targeting primary pollutants of concern first. In the event that the implementation of a BMP listed in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter or CMC 17.43.070 is determined to be infeasible at any site, the implementation of other BMPs that will achieve the equivalent reduction of pollutants shall be required.

Treatment control BMPs should be selected using the matrix in Table 3 of Attachment 3 of the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter as guidance to determine the removal efficiency of the BMP for the pollutants of concern for that project. Treatment control BMPs that maximize pollutant removal for the identified primary pollutants of concern should receive priority for BMP selection, followed by BMPs that maximize pollutant removal for all other pollutants of concern identified for the project. The most effective combination of BMPs for polluted runoff control that results in the most efficient reduction of pollutants shall be implemented. The applicant may select from the list of BMPs in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter. In the event that the implementation of a BMP listed in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter is determined to be infeasible at any site, the implementation of other BMPs that will achieve the equivalent reduction of pollutants shall be required.

C. Sizing of Treatment Control BMPs. Where post-construction treatment controls are required, the BMPs (or suites of BMPs) shall be designed in accordance with the requirements contained in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter to infiltrate and/or treat the amount of stormwater runoff that will come from the project site, with an appropriate safety factor (i.e., two or greater), for flow-based BMPs.

The term “treatment” includes physical, biological and chemical processes such as filtration, the use of bioswales, detention and retention ponds and adsorption media. The actual type of treatment should be suited to the pollutants generated by the development as indicated in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter.

D. Development on Steep Slopes. Specific requirements for development on steep slopes are contained in Section 2.5.2 of the LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter.

E. Cumulative Impacts. Because of the City’s designation under the Phase II NPDES regulations, all discretionary projects (except those that do not result in a physical change to the environment) within the urbanized area whose contributions are cumulatively considerable must implement one or more best management practices to reduce their contribution to the cumulative impact. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.070 Development-Specific Design Standards.
A. Commercial Development. Commercial development shall be designed to control the runoff of pollutants from structures, parking and loading areas. The following general measures shall be implemented to minimize the impacts of commercial development on water quality. Specific requirements for commercial development are contained in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter.

1. Properly Design Loading/Unloading Dock Areas. Loading/unloading dock areas have the potential for material spills to be quickly transported to the stormwater conveyance system.

2. Properly Design Repair/Maintenance Bays. Oil and grease, solvents, car battery acid, coolant, and gasoline from repair and maintenance bays can negatively impact stormwater if allowed to come into contact with stormwater runoff.

3. Properly Design Vehicle/Equipment Wash Areas. The activity of vehicle/equipment washing/steam cleaning has the potential to contribute metals, oil and grease, solvents, phosphates, and suspended solids to the stormwater conveyance system.

4. Properly Design Parking Areas and Parking Lots. Parking areas and parking lots contain pollutants such as heavy metals, oil and grease, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are deposited on parking lot surfaces by motor vehicles. These pollutants are directly transported to surface waters. Parking lots may also accumulate oil, grease, and water insoluble hydrocarbons from vehicle drippings and engine system leaks.

B. Restaurants. Restaurants shall be designed to minimize runoff of oil and grease, solvents, phosphates, and suspended solids to the storm drain system.

C. Gasoline Stations and Automotive Repair Facilities. Gasoline stations and automotive repair facilities shall be designed to minimize runoff of oil and grease, solvents, car battery acid, coolant and gasoline to stormwater system.

D. Outdoor Material Storage Areas. Outdoor material storage areas refer to storage areas or storage facilities used solely for the storage of materials. Improper storage of materials outdoors may provide an opportunity for toxic compounds, oil and grease, heavy metals, nutrients, suspended solids, and other pollutants to enter the stormwater conveyance system.

E. Trash Storage Areas. A trash storage area refers to an area where a trash receptacle or receptacles are located for use as a repository for solid wastes. Loose trash and debris can be easily transported by the forces of water or wind into nearby storm drain inlets, channels, and/or creeks. (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.43.080 Single-Family Residential.
To mitigate the increased runoff rates from single-family residences due to new impervious surfaces, new and remodel projects which need an erosion and drainage control plan shall include design elements which accommodate on-site percolation, retention or collection of stormwater runoff such that the peak runoff rate after development either meets the eighty-fifth percentile storm event criterion or does not exceed predevelopment runoff levels to the maximum extent practicable, and that runoff that will come from the project site meets the applicable requirements contained in the City’s LID Guidance Manual in Appendix I to this chapter. BMPs (including those outlined in the California Stormwater Best Management Practice Handbooks) which may achieve this objective fit into these categories:

A. Minimizing impervious areas;

B. Increase rainfall infiltration;

C. Minimize directly connected impervious areas (DCIAs). (Ord. 2014-01 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 2013-04 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Appendix I Low Impact Development Guidance Manual.
1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose

This Low Impact Development Guidance Manual (Manual) is intended for use by project developers such as architects, engineers, and building contractors, in designing and constructing projects within the City of Carmel-by-the-Sea (City) to comply with the City’s Low Impact Development (LID) requirements. City staff involved in reviewing plans and issuing permits for a project will use this Manual to determine whether or not the project has been designed to meet these requirements.

1.2 Background

Discharges from the City’s storm drainage system are regulated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) of the State of California. The initial NPDES permit was called the “General Permit for the Discharge of Storm Water from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems, Order No. 2003-0005-DWQ.” The City became subject to this permit on May 1, 2008. The RWQCB periodically revises its overall storm drainage requirements and imposes them on dischargers by reissuing its General Permit under a new Order number, or by issuing specific requirements to dischargers.

This Low Impact Development Guidance Manual reflects the “Post-Construction Stormwater Management Requirements for Development Projects in the Central Coast Region” adopted by the RWQCB on September 6, 2012. These are referred to herein as the “RWQCB Post-Construction Requirements.”

A condition of compliance under the NPDES permit is that the City implements its Storm Water Management Program. One of the State-required components of that Program is to develop and implement a set of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce storm water runoff and storm water pollution emanating from new development and redevelopment projects located within the City. This is accomplished by using the LID concepts described in this Manual during the design and construction of those projects.

LID is a development approach that (1) reduces the amount of storm water runoff by retaining a portion of the storm water on the project site where it can infiltrate into the ground or be released in a controlled manner, and (2) in some instances reduces the amount of pollutants in storm water through natural or manmade treatment processes, so that these discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of receiving water quality standards established by the RWQCB.

1.3 Authority

Chapters 17.10, 17.34, 17.42, 17.43, and 17.70 of the Carmel-by-the-Sea Municipal Code (CMC) establish certain of the BMP requirements described in this Manual. For ease of reference, citations from sections of these Chapters are designated herein as (§xx.xx.xxx). In addition, on November 3, 2009 the City Council adopted a document titled “BMP Guidance Series” contained in Appendix J to Chapter 17.43 CMC as official City policies pertaining to storm water pollution prevention from new development and redevelopment projects. Requirements taken from that document are designated herein as (BGS). The City may from time to time update the BMP Guidance Series by revising or adding to the requirements contained in that document.

The City has adopted the requirements described in this Manual to control the volume, rate, and potential pollutant load of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment projects as may be appropriate to minimize the generation, transport and discharge of pollutants as defined by Chapter 17.43 of the CMC. The City will incorporate these requirements into any construction or building-related permit to be issued for the development or redevelopment. (§17.42.020)

The purpose of the requirements in Chapter 17.43 is to protect and enhance coastal waters within the City in accordance with the policies of the City’s Local Coastal Plan, the California Coastal Act, and the City’s NPDES permit requirements, and to ensure that permitted development shall be sited and designed to conserve natural drainage features and vegetation, minimize the introduction of pollutants into coastal waters to the maximum extent practicable, limit the discharge of stormwater runoff, and protect the overall quality of coastal waters and resources. (§17.43.010)

1.4 LID BMP Implementation Tracking

In order to facilitate the design review and permitting process, when the plans for a project are submitted to the City they should include a completed copy of the “BMP Implementation Tracking Form” contained in Attachment 1. The plans should also show the locations of the BMPs that have been incorporated into the design of the project.

1.5 Definitions

The terms in this Section are defined as they apply in this LID Guidance Manual.

Hillside: Hillside means property located in an area with known erosive soil conditions, where the development contemplates grading on any natural slope that is 25% or greater.

Impermeable or Impervious Surface: These terms are used interchangeably in this LID Guidance Manual. Impermeable surface is defined in Chapter 17.70 of the City’s Municipal Code to mean a surface artificially constructed so as to prevent or largely inhibit the infiltration of rainwater or runoff into the natural soils or underlying geologic materials. Impervious surface is defined in the RWQCB’s Post-Construction Requirements to mean a hard, non-vegetated surface area that prevents or significantly limits the entry of water into the soil mantle, as would occur under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious/impermeable surfaces include, but are not limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, oiled, macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of stormwater.

Net Impervious Area: The sum of new and replaced post-project impervious areas, minus any reduction in total imperviousness from the pre-project to post-project condition: Net Impervious Area = (New and Replaced Impervious Area) – (Reduced Impervious Area Credit), where Reduced Impervious Area Credit is the total pre-project to post-project reduction in impervious area, if any.

New Development: Land disturbing activities that include the construction or installation of buildings, roads, driveways and other impervious surfaces. Development projects with pre-existing impervious surfaces are not considered New Development.

Permeable or Pervious Surface: A surface that allows varying amounts of stormwater to infiltrate into the ground. Examples include pasture, native vegetation areas, landscape areas, and permeable pavements designed to infiltrate. Permeable pavements include pavers which are set in sand so that water can percolate between the pavers, such as those commonly used for patios, walkways, and driveways.

Redevelopment: On a site that has already been developed, construction or installation of a building or other structure subject to the City’s planning and building authority including: 1) the creation or addition of impervious surfaces; 2) the expansion of a building footprint or addition or replacement of a structure; or 3) structural development including construction, installation or expansion of a building or other structure. It does not include routine road maintenance, nor does it include emergency construction activities required to immediately protect public health and safety.

Regulated Projects: Regulated Projects include all New Development or Redevelopment projects that create and/or replace >2,500 square feet of impervious surface (collectively over the entire project site).

Steep Slopes: Has the same meaning as “Hillside”.

1.6 Exception Discharges

Discharges of other than storm water to waters shall be effectively prohibited, except for the following non-storm water discharges which are not prohibited, provided any pollutant discharges are identified and appropriate control measures to minimize the impacts of such discharges are developed and implemented. This provision does not obviate the need to obtain any other appropriate permits for such discharges:

a. Water line flushing;

b. Individual residential car washing;

c. Diverted stream flows;

d. Rising ground waters;

e. Uncontaminated ground water infiltration (as defined at 40 C.F.R. § 35.2005(20)) to separate storm sewers;

f. Uncontaminated pumped ground water;

g. Discharges from potable water sources;

h. Foundation drains;

i. Air conditioning condensation;

j. Springs;

k. Water from crawl space pumps;

l. Footing drains;

m. Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;

n. Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges; and

o. Incidental runoff of potable or recycled water from landscaped areas (as defined and in accordance with section B.4 of this Order).

Discharges or flows from fire-fighting activities are excluded from the effective prohibition against non-storm water and need only be addressed where they are identified as significant sources of pollutants to waters of the U.S. If the City determines that any individual or class of non-storm water discharge(s) listed above may be a significant source of pollutants to waters of the U.S., or poses a threat to water quality standards (beneficial uses), the City may require the discharger to monitor and submit a report and to implement BMPs on the discharge.

2.0 DESIGN

2.1 Selection of BMPs

In selecting BMPs to incorporate into the project design, the applicant should first identify the pollutants of concern that are anticipated to be generated as a result of the development. Table 1 in Attachment 3 should be used as a guide in identifying these pollutants of concern. Pollutants generated by the development that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics will be considered the primary pollutants of concern:

1. Current loadings or historical deposits of the pollutant are impairing the beneficial uses of a receiving water.

2. Elevated levels of the pollutant are found in water or sediments of a receiving water and/or have the potential to be toxic to or bioaccumulate in organisms therein.

3. Inputs of the pollutant are at a level high enough to be considered potentially toxic.

2.1.1 Site Design and Source Control BMPs. Site design and source control BMPs should be selected based on pollutants commonly associated with the project type, as identified in Table 1 of Attachment 3. BMPs that minimize the identified pollutants of concern should be selected from the matrix in Table 2 of Attachment 3. In the event that the implementation of a BMP listed in Table 2 of Attachment 3 is determined to be infeasible at any site, the implementation of other BMPs that will achieve the equivalent reduction of pollutants will be required.

2.1.2 Treatment Control BMPs. In many cases proper application of appropriate site design and source control BMPs will meet the City’s LID requirements, and treatment control BMPs will not be necessary. However, when site design and source control BMPs are not adequate, treatment control BMP(s) will be necessary. Treatment control BMPs should be selected from the matrix in Table 3 of Attachment 3 as guidance to determine the removal efficiency of the BMP for the pollutants of concern for that project. Treatment control BMPs that maximize pollutant removal for the identified primary pollutants of concern should receive priority for BMP selection, followed by BMPs that maximize pollutant removal for all other pollutants of concern identified for the project. The most effective combination of BMPs for polluted runoff control that results in the most efficient reduction of pollutants should be implemented. In the event that the implementation of a BMP listed in the matrix in Table 3 of Attachment 3 is determined to be infeasible on the project site, the implementation of other treatment control BMP(s) that will achieve the equivalent reduction of pollutants will be required.

Where treatment controls are required, the BMPs (or suites of BMPs) shall be designed to infiltrate and/or treat the amount of stormwater runoff as follows:

1. For volume-based BMPs, the amount of storm water runoff produced by the eighty-fifth percentile, 24-hour storm event, based on local rainfall data.

2. For flow-based BMPs, two times the amount of storm water runoff produced by the eighty-fifth percentile, one-hour storm event, based on local rainfall data.

3. Limited Exclusion: Restaurants and retail gasoline outlets where the land area for development or redevelopment is less than 5,000 square feet are excluded from these volume- and flow-based numerical treatment control BMP design standards.

The term “treatment” includes physical, biological and chemical processes such as filtration, the use of bioswales, detention and retention ponds and adsorption media. The actual type of treatment should be suited to the pollutants generated by the development as indicated in Table 1 of Attachment 3.

Descriptions of commonly used treatment control BMPs are contained in Attachment 2. Detailed design information for treatment control BMPs, and examples, can be found in Sections 2 through 5 of the CASQA Handbook, and in Appendices C through E of the Santa Barbara Manual, both of which are described in Section 6.0 of this Manual.

At its discretion and for good cause, the City may waive one or more of the requirements pertaining to treatment control BMPs if impracticability for a specific property can be established. A waiver of impracticability will be granted only when all other treatment control BMPs have been considered and rejected as infeasible. Recognized Potential situations of impracticability may include, (i) extreme limitations of space for treatment on a project site, (ii) unfavorable or unstable soil conditions making a site unsuitable for infiltration, and (iii) risk of ground water contamination because a known unconfined aquifer lies beneath the land surface or an existing or potential underground source of drinking water is less than 10 feet from the soil surface. A waiver may be revoked for cause and with proper notice. A waiver of requirements may be subject to prior approval by the RWQCB, depending on the type of requirement being waived.

2.2 Watercourse Protection

Watercourses located on private property are required to be kept free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, stagnant pools of water and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse to the extent required by the City. Healthy bank vegetation should not be removed beyond that actually necessary for maintenance, nor should such vegetation be removed in a manner which increases the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner is responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion of the watercourse that is within their property lines to protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse on-site and downstream. Property owners shall select “Soft Engineered” techniques when possible for maintaining and stabilizing stream banks. (§17.42.020).

2.3 Landscaping Requirements

In order to protect and enhance the City’s urbanized forest and landscaped amenities, to protect environmentally sensitive habitat areas from degradation, to provide for the restoration of native vegetation, and to promote water conservation the following landscaping requirements will be imposed on new development and redevelopment projects. (§17.34.010)

These requirements apply to all new development or substantial alteration of existing development proposed on private property anywhere in the City. (§17.34.020)

2.3.1 Plantings:

2.3.1.1 All Sites (§17.34.060):

1. In order to reduce the potential for irrigation run-off that could contribute to storm water pollution, a minimum of 75 percent of new plant materials on the project site shall be native plants and/or noninvasive drought-tolerant plants as determined by the City Forester.

2. All plants within landscaped areas on any public right-of-way adjacent to private property shall be drought-tolerant and low water use predominantly native species as determined by the City Forester.

3. A minimum of 75 percent of new plant materials in all open space areas on project sites in the commercial, R-4, and R-1 districts shall be planted with drought-tolerant and low water use species as determined by the City Forester.

2.3.1.2 Residential Sites (§17.34.070):

1. All properties located in the R-1 or R-4 district shall contribute to the urbanized forest or other vegetation characteristic of the neighborhood by harboring an appropriate mix of upper and lower canopy trees and/or shrubs consistent with the neighborhood context and the neighborhood streetscape.

2. Landscaping in public rights-of-way in the R-1 district shall be limited to native, drought-tolerant plants.

2.3.1.3 Commercial Sites (§17.34.080):

1. In all commercial districts a minimum of 50 percent of the required open space on the project site shall be landscaped. The combined total area of nonliving materials such as garden benches, water features and patterned paving treatments shall not comprise more than 25 percent of the required landscaping on the site. All landscaping improvements shall include upper canopy trees on-site and/or in the sidewalk in front of the property whenever possible.

2. Building sites incorporating surface parking lots shall include at least 15 percent of the site area in landscaping. To help reduce runoff into the City’s storm drainage system, landscaping shall be distributed along all street frontages and pedestrian walkways that are adjacent to parking areas. Landscaping shall also be provided within the interior of surface lots to break up large expanses of paving. Parking lots with four or more vehicles shall provide interior landscaping of at least 10 square feet per vehicle.

2.3.2 Materials of Construction (§17.34.060):

1. Use of materials that allow for percolation of rain into the soil and reduce water run-off is encouraged.

2. Paved areas shall be designed to be small, and large continuous areas of paving shall be avoided. Paved areas shall include design features such as sand-set paving and/or drainage collection and distribution systems that enhance surface water percolation.

3. Landscaping plans for projects in any zoning district shall, where feasible, include the use of water retention storage devices such as cisterns or underground bladders to capture precipitation or surface runoff for landscape maintenance purposes or detention basins or berms to retain water on-site for natural percolation into the soil.

2.4 Impermeable Site Coverage (§17.10.030)

These requirements apply to all new development, or substantial alteration of existing development, proposed on private property anywhere in the City.

1. Impermeable site coverage, which is defined in Chapter 17.70 of the City’s Municipal Code to mean a surface artificially constructed so as to prevent or largely inhibit the infiltration of rainwater or runoff into the natural soils or underlying geologic materials as defined in Section 1.5, shall be limited to a maximum of 22% of the base floor area allowed for the site. Allowable base floor areas for typical lot sizes are contained in Table 17.10-D of the CMC. For a typical 4,000 square-foot site the maximum allowable impermeable site coverage equals 396 square feet or approximately 10% of the site.

2. If at least 50 percent of all site coverage on the property is made of permeable or semi-permeable materials, an additional amount of site coverage of up to 4% of the site area may be allowed for use in a single driveway of up to nine feet in width.

2.5 Site Design

All projects shall be designed with the objectives of minimizing the introduction of pollutants that may result in water quality impacts, and controlling post-development peak runoff rates and average volumes to maintain or reduce pre-development downstream erosion rates. (§17.43.010)

All development shall be evaluated for potential adverse impacts to water quality, and the applicant is to consider site design, source control, and treatment control BMPs in order to minimize polluted runoff and water quality impacts resulting from the development. In order to maximize the reduction of water quality impacts, BMPs should be incorporated into the project design in the following progression: (1) Site design BMPs, (2) Source control BMPs, and (3) Treatment control BMPs. (§17.43.060).

2.5.1 Performance Requirements (RWQCB Post-Construction Requirements)

The RWQCB’s Post-Construction Requirements pertain to both residential and commercial types of Regulated Projects (as defined in Section 1.5). Note that some of the requirements in this Section 2.5.1 overlap with requirements in Sections 2.5.2, 2.5.3 and/or 2.5.4.

Because of the relatively small lot sizes in the City, it is expected that the majority of projects will not be subject to the RWQCB’s Post-Construction Requirements, and that only a small number of projects will be subject to Performance Requirement No. 1, which is described below.

Any project other than a detached single family home having a Net Impervious Area (as defined in Section 1.5) = 5,000 square feet, or a detached single family home project having a Net Impervious Area = 15,000 square feet, will be subject to the more complex requirements of Performance Requirement No. 2: Water Quality Treatment. Performance Requirement No. 2 is described in Attachment 5.

Projects having a Net Impervious Area = 15,000 square feet, and which are not detached single family home projects, as well as single family residences = 15,000 square feet in WMZs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9, and those portions of WMZs 4, 7, and 10 that overlie designated Groundwater Basins; and all Regulated Projects over 22,500 square feet of impervious surface area in WMZs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 will be subject to additional requirements as described in Attachment 5.

Performance Requirement No. 1: Site Design and Runoff Reduction:

All Regulated Projects that create and/or replace = 2,500 square feet of impervious surface (collectively over the entire project site), including detached single-family home projects, are required to implement at least the following design strategies:

1. Limit disturbance of creeks and natural drainage features

2. Minimize compaction of highly permeable soils

3. Limit clearing and grading of native vegetation at the site to the minimum area needed to build the project, allow access, and provide fire protection

4. Minimize impervious surfaces by concentrating improvements on the least-sensitive portions of the site, while leaving the remaining land in a natural undisturbed state

5. Minimize stormwater runoff by implementing one or more of the following site design measures:

6. Direct roof runoff into cisterns or rain barrels for reuse

7. Direct roof runoff onto vegetated areas safely away from building foundations and footings, consistent with California building code

8. Direct runoff from sidewalks, walkways, and/or patios onto vegetated areas safely away from building foundations and footings, consistent with California building code

9. Direct runoff from driveways and/or uncovered parking lots onto vegetated areas safely away from building foundations and footings, consistent with California building code

10. Construct bike lanes, driveways, uncovered parking lots, sidewalks, walkways, and patios with permeable surfaces

11. The Permittee shall confirm that projects comply with Site Design and Runoff Reduction Performance Requirements by means of appropriate documentation (e.g., check lists) accompanying applications for project approval.

2.5.2 Development on Steep Slopes (§17.43.060)

In addition to the requirements in Section 2.5, project designs shall incorporate soil stabilization and infiltration practices during the construction of roads, bridges, culverts and outfalls to prevent stream bank or hillside erosion. Project plans must include the following BMPs to decrease the potential of slopes and/or channels from eroding and impacting stormwater runoff:

1. Convey runoff safely from the tops of slopes and stabilize disturbed slopes.

2. Utilize existing natural drainage systems to the maximum extent feasible.

3. Control and minimize excess flow to natural drainage systems to the maximum extent feasible.

4. Stabilize permanent channel crossings using “soft engineering” practices when possible.

5. Vegetate slopes with native or drought-tolerant vegetation.

6. Additional measures to prevent downstream erosion, such as cisterns, infiltration pits and/or contour drainage outlets that disperse water back to sheet flow, should be implemented for projects discharging onto slopes greater than 10%.

2.5.3 Residential Projects

For residential projects, in addition to the applicable requirements in Section 2.5, 17.43.080, and described elsewhere within this Manual, the following additional LID principles are to be incorporated into the design of all residential projects, as appropriate:

2.5.3.1 Small Residential Projects

For small residential projects that must only go through a ministerial review process and conform to the site zoning requirements, such as either a new single-family unit or minor modifications to an existing single family unit or a single structure, LID objectives are to be accomplished by applying the following principles to the design (§17.43.080 and BGS):

1. Use low-maintenance drought-tolerant landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application.

2. Label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language (such as: “NO DUMPING – DRAINS TO OCEAN”) and/or graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping.

3. Minimize areas that are directly connected to the City’s storm drainage system by directing roof gutters and other impervious areas to landscaped areas where possible. Roof drains may be eliminated only in one to two-story buildings in residential and some commercial areas. Where these cannot be eliminated, direct the downspout of the gutter to landscaped areas or into an infiltration trench. Install several gutters to distribute the flow.

4. Minimize impervious areas and increase rainfall infiltration by using alternate paving materials (pavers), landscaping, mulch, gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover, and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement. Pavers are recommended for driveways, walkways, and patios in single-family residences if Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements do not have to be met.

2.5.3.2 Large Residential Projects

For large residential projects that must go through a discretionary design review process and which typically require a use permit or a subdivision map, LID objectives are to be accomplished by applying the following principles to the design (§17.43.010 and BGS):

1. Maintain and use existing natural drainage courses and vegetation by not filling in the natural drainage features at the site, preserving riparian areas and wetlands, maintaining invert/streambeds to maximize capacity, and providing vegetated setbacks or buffer strips outside of the maximum water surface level.

2. Conserve natural resources and areas by clustering development on the least environmentally sensitive portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural, undisturbed condition.

3. Protect slopes and channels from eroding and impacting storm water runoff by:

i. Conveying runoff safely from the tops of slopes and stabilizing disturbed slopes.

ii. Utilizing natural drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable.

iii. Stabilizing permanent channel crossings.

iv. Vegetating slopes with native or drought tolerant vegetation, as appropriate.

v. Installing energy dissipaters, such as riprap, at the outlets of new storm drains, culverts, conduits, or channels that enter unlined channels

4. Minimize the amount of directly connected impervious surface and total area of impervious surface.

5. Minimize the length of driveways and avoid installing curb and gutter along driveways and streets where appropriate, so that runoff from these areas can flow into adjacent landscaped or other permeable areas.

6. In low-traffic areas, reduce sidewalk widths as much as possible while still being in compliance with ADA requirements.

7. Incorporate or connect to existing on-site retention and infiltration measures.

8. Direct rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than driveways or impervious surfaces to reduce the amount of stormwater leaving the site.

9. Minimize clearing and grading, and set aside open space to the extent feasible.

10. Use alternate paving materials (e.g., porous asphalt, pervious concrete, and pavers), landscaping, mulch, gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover, and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement. Pavers are recommended for driveways, walkways, and patios in single-family residences if ADA requirements do not have to be met. In non-residential areas, pavers are recommended for emergency access roads, overflow parking areas, and non-handicapped parking stalls, keeping in mind that some types of alternate paving materials may not be suitable where heavy loads such as trucks.

11. In new residential areas reduce street width by eliminating on-street parking (where such actions do not pose a safety hazard). In addition to reducing the impervious area, this control has the added benefit of removing cars from streets and making street sweeping easier and more effective. If on-street parking in residential areas is eliminated, the developer must provide adequate off-street visitor parking.

12. If alleys are included in a proposed development, width should be minimized or alternate paving materials should be used.

13. Provide green areas in new residential developments where people can walk their pets and keep pet excrement away from sidewalks and streets where it may contribute to storm water pollution.

14. Install landscaping or other cover materials to minimize erosion from graded surfaces. Promote the use of natural vegetation by using parking lot islands and other landscaped areas. Use of native plant materials is recommended because native plants require less maintenance and irrigation. Since native plants take longer to cover slopes, during the first few years supplemental protection (erosion blanket, mulch, etc.) may be necessary.

15. Use low-maintenance landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application.

16. Label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language (such as: “NO DUMPING – DRAINS TO OCEAN”) and/or graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping. Legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained.

17. Where possible, eliminate gutters/roof drains or direct runoff to landscaped areas. Roof drains can be eliminated only in one to two-story buildings. Where these cannot be eliminated, direct the downspout of the gutter to landscaped areas or into an infiltration trench. Install several gutters to distribute the flow.

18. In new residential developments involving more than 50 units, construct a designated vehicle wash area so that the runoff from vehicle washing can be property treated and/or disposed. Contact the local wastewater authority to determine if the discharge can be plumbed to the sanitary sewer. If not, provide appropriate treatment and disposal of this runoff.

19. Grade and pave outdoor waste receptacle areas to prevent run-on of storm water, and install a low containment berm around it. Alternately, construct a covered enclosure with wash-down capabilities plumbed into the sanitary sewer, after first contacting the local wastewater authority to verify that this practice will be acceptable.

2.5.4 Commercial Projects

For commercial projects, in addition to the applicable requirements in Section 2.5 and described elsewhere within this Manual, the following LID principles are to be incorporated into the design of all commercial projects, as appropriate (§17.43.070 and BGS):

The treatment controls shall be designed to remove oil and petroleum hydrocarbons, and shall be operated and maintained to ensure that sludge and oil is removed at a frequency that will prevent the treatment controls from fouling or plugging.

4. If feasible, build underground or multi-story parking structures so that not only is impervious surface minimized but the parking surfaces are under a roof and not exposed to storm water.

5. Where possible use cooperative or shared parking. This may be a cooperative effort between commercial entities or between commercial entities and the City.

3.0 EROSION AND DRAINAGE CONTROL PLANS (§17.43.030)

An Erosion and Drainage Control Plan (EDCP) to minimize during- and post-construction polluted runoff containing the following information shall be included in the submitted design plans for new development that (a) increases site coverage by more than five percent of the site area, or (b) involves grading that will affect drainage patterns on or off the site, or (c) involves either a rebuild or construction of a new building:

1. Site design and source control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction polluted runoff, including details regarding how the project will use these BMPs to minimize adverse effects of the project on water quality.

2. Drainage improvements (e.g., locations of infiltration basins).

3. Potential flow paths where erosion may occur after construction.

4. Methods to accommodate on-site percolation, revegetation of disturbed portions of the site, address on-site and/or off-site impacts and construction of any necessary improvements.

5. Storm drain pollution prevention measures including all construction elements and BMPs to address the following goals in connection with both construction and long-term operation of the site:

1) Maximize on-site retention and infiltration measures including directing rooftop runoff to permeable areas rather than driveways.

2) Maximize, to the extent practicable, the percentage of permeable surfaces and limit impervious areas that are directly connected to the City’s storm drainage system in order to allow more percolation of runoff into the ground.

4.0 WATER QUALITY MITIGATION PLANS (§17.43.030 AND BGS)

A Water Quality Mitigation Plan (WQMP) is required for any project which requires an EDCP and which either:

(1) Fails to adequately address water quality impacts using appropriate site design and source control measures, or

(2) Is in one of the following categories of development:

1. Single-Family Hillside Residences. Hillside means property located in an area with known erosive soil conditions, where the development contemplates grading on any natural slope that is twenty-five percent or greater.

2. Industrial/Commercial Developments.

3. Automotive Repair Shops.

4. Retail Gasoline Outlets.

5. Restaurants.

6. Home Subdivisions with 10 or more housing units

7. Parking lots 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area or with 25 or more parking spaces and potentially exposed to storm water runoff

8. Projects that discharge to an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) or coastal water. Such projects are defined as being all development and redevelopment located within or directly adjacent to or discharging directly to an environmentally sensitive area (where discharges from the development or redevelopment will enter receiving waters within the environmentally sensitive area). “Directly adjacent” means situated within 200 feet of the environmentally sensitive area. “Discharging directly to” means outflow from a drainage conveyance system that is composed entirely of flows from the subject development or redevelopment site, and not commingled with flows from adjacent lands.

In addition to the site design and source control BMPs being provided in the project, the WQMP shall include treatment control BMPs identified in Table 3 of Attachment 3 to minimize post-construction runoff of the types of pollutants listed in Table 1 of Attachment 3, which are characteristic of this type of project. The WQMP shall also include an operation and maintenance plan for these treatment control BMPs.

The WQMP shall be certified by a California Registered Civil Engineer or Licensed Architect approved by the City, and shall include the following information:

1. Site design, source control and treatment control BMPs that will be implemented to minimize post-construction polluted runoff.

2. Pre-development peak runoff rate and average volume.

3. Drainage improvements (e.g., locations of diversions/conveyances for upstream runoff).

4. Potential flow paths where erosion may occur after construction.

5. Methods to accommodate on-site percolation, revegetation of disturbed portions of the site, address on-site and/or off-site impacts, and construction of any necessary improvements.

6. Measures to treat, infiltrate, and/or filter runoff from impervious surfaces (e.g., roads, driveways, parking structures, building pads, roofs, patios, etc.) on the subject parcel(s) and to discharge the runoff in a manner that avoids erosion on or downslope of the subject parcel, the need for upgrades to the City’s storm drainage system, discharge of pollutants (e.g., oil, heavy metals, toxics) to coastal waters, or other potentially adverse impacts. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, the use of structures (alone or in combination) such as biofilters and grasses waterways, on-site desilting basins, detention ponds, dry wells, etc.

7. Where treatment controls are required, information describing how the BMPs (or suites of BMPs) have been designed to infiltrate and/or treat the amount of stormwater runoff produced by all storms as described in Section 2.1.2 of this Manual. The actual type of treatment should be linked to the pollutants generated by the development as indicated in Table 1 of Attachment 3.

8. A long-term plan and schedule for the monitoring and maintenance of all drainage-control devices. All treatment control BMPs shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired when necessary prior to September 30th of each year. Owners of these devices will be responsible for insuring that they continue to function properly, and additional inspections should occur after storms as needed throughout the rainy season. Repairs, modifications, or installation of additional BMPs, as needed, should be carried out prior to the next rainy season. The City will determine if the treatment control BMPs require monitoring, and if so, the City must approve the monitoring program.

5.0 ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF TREATMENT CONTROL BMPS (§17.43.040 AND BGS)

If a project is required to include treatment control BMPs, the applicant will be required to provide verification of maintenance provisions for these BMPs through such means as may be appropriate, including, but not limited to legal agreements, covenants, CEQA mitigation requirements and/or Conditional Use Permits. Verification at a minimum shall include the developer’s signed statement accepting responsibility for maintenance until the responsibility is legally transferred and either:

1. A signed statement from the public entity assuming responsibility for structural and treatment control BMP maintenance and that it meets all local agency design standards; or

2. Written conditions in the sales or lease agreement, which require the recipient to assume responsibility for maintenance and conduct a maintenance inspection at least once a year; or

3. Written text in project conditions, covenants, and restrictions (CCRs) for residential properties assigning maintenance responsibilities to the home owners association for maintenance of the structural and treatment control BMPs; or

4. Any other legally enforceable agreement acceptable to the City that assigns responsibility for the maintenance of post-construction structural and treatment control BMPs.

A sample form of Agreement to accomplish these objectives is contained in Attachment 4.

Printed educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on what storm water management facilities are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how the necessary maintenance can be performed. The transfer of this information will also be required with any subsequent sale of the property.

Descriptions of Treatment Control BMPs

Source: Best Management Practices Guidance Series (BGS)

The BMPs described below are treatment control BMPs that can be built at new development and redevelopment sites to capture and treat the polluted runoff before it enters the City’s storm drain system or other receiving waters. Many of these are included in Table 3 of Attachment 3. When site design and source control BMPs alone are inadequate to fulfill the City’s storm water pollution prevention requirements for a proposed project, treatment control BMPs which are feasible for the proposed development should be incorporated into its design.

Treatment controls must be designed such that volumes and flows in excess of the design rainfall event bypass the unit, otherwise there is the possibility of aggravating flooding and also causing resuspension of previously captured sediments or other constituents. Also, all of the treatment BMPs described below require some inspection, maintenance, and disposal of solids to ensure optimum performance and often to avoid flooding.

1. Rooftop Catchment Systems – These are rooftops which can sometimes be designed into large commercial and industrial sites to pool stormwater which, following the storm, evaporates. This effectively eliminates rooftop runoff from the storm drain system, and thereby reduces the hydraulically-connected impervious area. Another function of these systems is to slow down the runoff to reduce peaks. Problems with rooftop catchment systems are mainly related to leakage.

2. Vegetated Filter Strips – Vegetated filter strips, buffer strips, or riparian buffer zones are strips of vegetation placed between receiving waters (e.g., along streams) and pollutant sources. The effectiveness of the strips depends primarily on the width of the strip, and the vegetation type and condition. Strips of 100-300 feet in width are often considered. Such strips have been successfully applied to urban, agricultural, and forestry situations. Vegetation type selection must take into account the climate and usually should be drought-resistant. Maintenance is primarily annual cutting. Such strips are recommended for developments located along receiving waters such as streams, rivers and lakes, but outside the flood control boundary.

3. Vegetated Swales – Swales are shallow low gradient channels that are vegetated. They are commonly applied in rural residential areas in lieu of traditional curb/gutters and underground stormwater drainage pipes. Water quality improvement is achieved primarily through filtration, and performance is dependent on the swale hydraulic capacity and vegetation type and condition. Influent water should be relatively free of coarse sediment to avoid burying the vegetation. Where sediment loads are of concern, sediment settling basins can be provided upstream of the swales. Maintenance consists primarily of vegetation management and settling basin cleanouts. Swales are generally recommended for low-density residential developments located in relatively flat terrain.

4. Infiltration Basins – Infiltration basins store and infiltrate stormwater into the surficial groundwater aquifer. Performance is critically dependent on soil porosity and adequate depth to groundwater. Such conditions are typical of inland valleys, in contrast to low lying coastal areas. In order to maintain recharge rates, influent water may require pretreatment to remove sediments. Infiltration basins are effective at reducing runoff rates and volumes and can provide water supply benefits through aquifer recharge. Maintenance primarily consists of periodic removal of accumulated trash, debris and sediments to maintain recharge rates. Infiltration basins are generally recommended in areas where the depth to groundwater is relatively high and the soils are highly pervious. Where such conditions exist, this technology is generally applicable to the entire range of urban development, although the potential for groundwater contamination is often of concern in industrial areas.

5. Infiltration Trenches – Infiltration trenches are shallow drains filled with high porosity materials (e.g. gravel). Stormwater discharged to these trenches is stored during the runoff event and infiltrates into the groundwater during dry weather periods. As with infiltration basins, performance requires porous subsoils and adequate depth to the groundwater table. The acceptability and designs of infiltration trenches must take into consideration the potential for infiltrating water to adversely affect soil strength around foundations. Infiltration trenches are generally not recommended for roof runoff near buildings because of building code requirements; but can be effective as part of the overall open channel drainage system.

6. Dry Detention Ponds/Basins – These are basins designed to temporarily store and treat storm water prior to gradually releasing it downstream. Such basins can provide flood control and storm water treatment benefits. Treatment performance depends on storage volume (12-24 hours of residence time is considered a good rule of thumb), and good circulation (avoidance of short circuiting). A major factor limiting good performance is that, during larger storm runoff events, water entering a dry basin may resuspend previously settled material in which case the ponds may act as a source of sediment and associated chemicals. In general dry basins are not as effective as wet basins (discussed below), however, in certain arid areas, wet basins are not feasible. Performance of dry basins can be improved by incorporating slow release outlet structures. Such basins are generally applicable to residential, commercial, and industrial development in areas where there is insufficient runoff to maintain wet basins.

7. Retention Ponds/Wet Basins – These are basins that contain a permanent pool of water. Such ponds can provide flood control, ecological, and water quality benefits. The performance of wet basins depends on the size of the basin, watershed characteristics, and influent conditions. The primary treatment process in retention ponds is settling. Maintenance is required for removing debris, vegetation management, and maintaining the inlet and outlet structures. Accumulation rates in such basins typically require that accumulated sediment be removed about once every 10-20 years. Retention ponds are generally applicable to most urban situations, as long as there is adequate space for the facility and acceptable geological conditions.

8. Constructed/Restored Wetlands – In addition to providing flood control and water supply benefits through artificial recharge of groundwater, constructed wetlands designed for stormwater management provide water quality benefits through a number of processes including sedimentation, filtration, absorption, biological processes, and nutrient uptake. Pollutant removal performance depends on the size of the wetland relative to the watershed, the design of the wetland, and the type and composition of wetland vegetation. Wetlands also provide additional ecological and recreational benefits. If a significant amount of sedimentation is anticipated, a deep settling basin could be constructed (which the water would enter prior to reaching the wetland). The basin would require periodic maintenance to remove accumulated sediment. Constructed wetlands require maintenance, especially in the first 5-10 years during which vegetation is growing and natural seeding is occurring. Providing suitable hydrologic conditions for vegetation growth and water treatment is key to successful performance of constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands are generally applicable to most urban situations, as long as there is adequate space for the facility, an adequate source of water, and appropriate soils. In California, such wetlands would likely be seasonal in nature. The cost of urban lands often precludes this type of treatment in the more densely developed portions of urban areas.

A variation of this control is the use of existing wetlands for urban runoff treatment. Existing wetlands at or downstream of a new development/redevelopment project can be enhanced to improve hydrology, and runoff from the development project can be directed to the wetlands. Note that the dry detention ponds/basins, retention ponds/wet basins, and the constructed wetlands need to be periodically monitored for accumulation of toxic materials, and provisions made for cleanout and disposal pretreatment may be added (to remove heavy sediment trash and debris) to reduce maintenance. If a significant amount of sediment is anticipated, a deep settling basin could be constructed. This would also need to be periodically cleaned out to maintain capacity.

9. Filtration Systems – Filtration systems convey stormwater through filter media (e.g., sand, compost, charcoal) to treat the storm water. The chemicals treated vary depending on the type of media and may include fine sediment, colloidal material, hydrocarbons, organics, nutrients and dissolved metals. Such systems come in many sizes and designs including: (1) inserts placed in individual storm drain inlets, (2) linear units that treat stormwater from small impervious areas such as parking lots, and (3) large 1-2 acre sand filters that treat runoff from urban catchments. Filters are effective as long as the capacity of the filter is not exceeded, and the filter is not allowed to clog. Filter inserts are particularly problematic in this regard, and recent testing and evaluation questions their applicability where material in runoff will clog or block the filter. In stormwater applications filter systems are required to remove blocking materials (leaves, trash, debris, sediments, oil and grease) and storage to better manage flowrates. Experience to date with filter type inserts for drain inlets suggest that the units are easily clogged with sediment and debris, with resultant bypassing of most of the flows. Therefore, inserts are not recommended unless require frequent inspection and cleaning is performed. Filtration systems will have limited application in small well-maintained parking lots.

10. Oil/Grit Separators – Oil/grit (gravity) separators are usually multi-chambered treatment units that are placed underground and treat stormwater from a drainage catchment. The individual chambers often are designed to trap grit and floatables, and adsorb hydrocarbons. Flows in excess of the design capacity should be diverted around the unit, otherwise there is the possibility that sediment previously trapped in the chambers will be resuspended and flushed downstream. Inspection and maintenance is required to ensure that the units are not filling up with sediment, as accumulation can affect performance. Traditional gravity oil/water separators that utilize skimming devices and coalescing plates (to increase droplet size and capture) are generally not applicable to stormwater conditions where total hydrocarbon concentrations are generally less than 10 mg/l. The performance of oil/grit separators varies depending on the chosen design. Research should be done before selecting any separators to verify that they will perform as desired. In general, oil/grit separators are useful only at sites where there are chances that oil spills could occur and to a limited degree at development sites that have high oil and grease loadings such as petroleum storage yards and vehicle storage facilities.

Additional RWQCB Post-Construction Performance Requirements

Source: “Post-Construction Stormwater Management Requirements for Development Projects in the Central Coast Region” adopted by the RWQCB on July 12, 2013.

1) Performance Requirement No. 2: Water Quality Treatment

a) The Permittee shall require Regulated Projects, except detached single-family homes, = 5,000 square feet of Net Impervious Area, and detached single-family homes = 15,000 square feet of Net Impervious Area, to treat stormwater runoff as required in the Water Quality Treatment Performance Requirements in Section B.3.b. to reduce pollutant loads and concentrations using physical, biological, and chemical removal.

i) Net Impervious Area is the total (including new and replaced) post-project impervious areas, minus any reduction in total imperviousness from the pre-project to post-project condition: Net Impervious Area = (New and Replaced Impervious Area) – (Reduced Impervious Area Credit), where Reduced Impervious Area Credit is the total pre-project to post-project reduction in impervious area, if any.

b) The Permittee shall require each Regulated Project subject to Water Quality Treatment Performance Requirements to treat runoff generated by the Regulated Project site using the onsite measures below, listed in the order of preference (highest to lowest). Water Quality Treatment Performance Requirements shall apply to the runoff from existing, new, and replaced impervious surfaces on sites where runoff from existing impervious surfaces cannot be separated from runoff from new and replaced impervious surfaces.

i) Low Impact Development (LID) Treatment Systems – Implement harvesting and use, infiltration, and evapotranspiration Stormwater Control Measures that collectively achieve the following hydraulic sizing criteria for LID systems:

(1) Hydraulic Sizing Criteria for LID Treatment Systems – LID systems shall be designed to retain stormwater runoff equal to the volume of runoff generated by the 85th percentile 24-hour storm event, based on local rainfall data.

ii) Biofiltration Treatment Systems – Implement biofiltration treatment systems using facilities that must be demonstrated to be at least as effective as1 a biofiltration treatment system with the following design parameters:

(1) Maximum surface loading rate appropriate to prevent erosion, scour and channeling within the biofiltration treatment system itself and equal to 5 inches per hour, based on the flow of runoff produced from a rain event equal to or at least:

(a) 0.2 inches per hour intensity; or

(b) Two times the 85th percentile hourly rainfall intensity for the applicable area, based on historical records of hourly rainfall depth

(2) Minimum surface reservoir volume equal to the biofiltration treatment system surface area times a depth of 6 inches

(3) Minimum planting medium depth of 24 inches. The planting medium must sustain a minimum infiltration rate of 5 inches per hour throughout the life of the project and must maximize runoff retention and pollutant removal. A mixture of sand (60%-70%) meeting the specifications of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C33 and compost (30%-40%) may be used.

i) Site Assessment Measures – Permittees shall require the applicant for each Regulated Project to identify opportunities and constraints to implement LID Stormwater Control Measures. Permittees shall require the applicant to document the following, as appropriate to the development site:

• Site topography

• Hydrologic features including contiguous natural areas, wetlands, watercourses, seeps, or springs

• Depth to seasonal high groundwater

(1) The Permittee shall require the applicant for each Regulated Project to provide a map or diagram dividing the entire project site into discrete DMAs

(2) The Permittee shall require the applicant for each Regulated Project to account for the drainage from each DMA using measures identified in Sections B.4.d.iv. and B.4.d.v., below.

iv) Undisturbed and Natural Landscape Areas – Permittees shall require each Regulated Project to implement appropriate Site Design (Section B.4.d.ii.), and Runoff Reduction Measures in Performance Requirement No. 1, to reduce the amount of runoff for which retention and treatment is required. Runoff reduction measures that can be used to account for this reduction also include the below measures. The Retention Tributary Area calculation in Attachment D accounts for these reductions.

(1) Undisturbed or areas planted with native, drought-tolerant, or LID appropriate vegetation that do not receive runoff from other areas may be considered self-treating and no additional stormwater management is required.

(2) Runoff from impervious surfaces, generated by the rainfall events identified in Section B.4.c, may be directed to undisturbed or natural landscaped areas. When the applicant can demonstrate that this runoff will be infiltrated and will not produce runoff to the storm drain system, or a surface receiving waterbody, or create nuisance ponding that may affect vegetation health or contribute to vector problems, then no additional stormwater management is required for these impervious surfaces.

v) Structural Stormwater Control Measures – Where Regulated Project Applicants have demonstrated in their Stormwater Control Plans, and the Permittee has confirmed, that use of Site Design measures listed in Section B.4.d.ii., Runoff Reduction measures listed in Performance Requirement No. 1, and undisturbed and natural landscape areas discussed in Section B.4.d.iv., has been maximized to the extent feasible, Structural Stormwater Control Measures designed for water quality treatment and/or flow control shall be used to comply with Performance Requirement No. 3.

(1) The Permittee shall require the Regulated Project applicant to use structural Stormwater Control Measures that optimize retention and result in optimal protection and restoration of watershed processes, such as Structural Control Measures associated with small-scale, decentralized facilities designed to infiltrate, evapotranspirate, filter, or capture and use stormwater.

vi) Hydrologic Analysis and Structural Stormwater Control Measure Sizing – To determine Stormwater Control Measure sizing and design, Permittees shall require Regulated Project applicants to use one of the following: 1) hydrologic analysis and sizing methods as outlined in Attachment D; 2) locally/regionally calibrated continuous simulation model that results in equivalent optimization of on-site runoff volume retention; or 3) hydrologic analysis and sizing methods, equally effective in optimizing on-site retention of the runoff generated by the rainfall event specified in Section B.4.c, that have been approved by the Central Coast Water Board Executive Officer.

e) Ten Percent Adjustment for Sites with Technical Infeasibility – Where technical infeasibility, as described in Section C.1.c., prevents full on-site compliance with the Runoff Retention Performance Requirement, on-site retention of the full Retention Volume per Section B.4.d.vi. is not required and the Regulated Project is required to dedicate no less than ten percent of the Regulated Project’s Equivalent Impervious Surface Area4 to retention-based Stormwater Control Measures.

i) Use the Attachment E instructions to calculate the ten percent adjustment for applying the Runoff Retention Performance Requirement.

ii) The Water Quality Treatment Performance Requirement is not subject to this adjustment, i.e., mitigation to achieve full compliance with the Water Quality Treatment Performance Requirement is required on- or off-site.

f) Off-Site Mitigation – Off-site mitigation is required when Regulated Projects do not retain the full Retention Volume per Section B.4.b and B.4.c, and 1) fail to demonstrate technical infeasibility of full retention; or 2) demonstrate technical infeasibility of full retention AND fail to dedicate at least ten percent of the Regulated Project’s Equivalent Impervious Surface Area to retention-based Stormwater Control Measures.

i) Use the Attachment F instructions to calculate the Off-Site retention requirements when a Regulated Project subject to the Runoff Retention Performance Requirement does not allocate the full ten percent of the project site’s Equivalent Impervious Surface Area to retention-based Stormwater Control Measures.

g) Reporting Requirements – For each Regulated Project subject to the Runoff Retention Performance Requirement, the Permittee shall require the Project Applicant to provide the below information in a Stormwater Control Plan.

Appendix J BMP Guidance Series.
Updated February 4, 2014

COMMERCIAL WASHING AND CLEANING

This guidance specifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) for commercial washing and cleaning that shall be employed to protect water quality. Additional best management practices, measures and controls shall be employed as applicable and to the maximum extent practicable to prevent pollutants from entering storm water runoff.

BMPS APPLICABLE TO MOBILE CAR WASHERS AND CAR DETAILERS

The Goal and Purpose of these BMPs is to minimize or prevent the discharge of pollutants into storm drains from vehicle and equipment cleaning operations by either (1) discharging wash waters to the sanitary sewer, (2) containing wash water for offsite disposal, or (3) directing wash water (without cleaners) to landscaped areas.

Use These Best Management Practices:

BMP-1 Planning: Determine what collection method you will be using and where you are going to discharge wash water before starting a new job. Identify where all storm drains are located in the vicinity of the jobsite. Never discharge wastewater into a street, ditch, storm drain, or maintenance hole. Obtain all necessary permits and authorizations. If you are going to discharge into the sanitary sewer system at the job site, or on unpaved areas at the job site, always obtain the property owner’s permission.

BMP-2 Pre-Clean the Work Area: Before starting work sweep or vacuum the work area to pick up litter, trash, debris, dirt, and other materials which could become mixed in with the wash water. Use absorbents (such as rags, absorbent mats or pads, rice hull ash, cat litter, vermiculite, or sand) to pick up greasy or oily materials and spills. Waste materials from pre-cleaning may often be disposed of in the trash. Check with the local solid waste authority to be sure. Rags may be sent to an industrial laundry. Know which pre-cleaning wastes may be hazardous wastes. If there is any question as to whether a wash water, or waste material, is considered to be a hazardous material, check with the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials.

BMP-3 Washing and Detailing: Minimize the amount of water used during washing and detailing to reduce the amount of wash water that will need to be disposed. Avoid cleaning products that contain hazardous substances (e.g. hydrofluoric acid, muriatic acid, sodium hydroxide, bleach, etc.) that can create hazardous waste. When possible, avoid using soap and solvents – even biodegradable soap is harmful to the environment. If soap is used, use phosphate-free, non-toxic, biodegradable soap. Any soap, including those labeled “biodegradable” does not belong in creeks, ocean or ground-water. They are harmful to aquatic life and should never be misconstrued as safe for direct disposal to surface waters (i.e., storm drains).

BMP-4 Wash Water Containment and Collection: Contain and collect the wash water and dispose of it as described below. Decide what is the best method of collection (e.g., berms, storm drain cover mats, containment pools, vacuums/pumps, vacuum boom, inflatable pipe plug, etc). Locate property high and low spots to determine where wash water can be pooled for collection.

Wash water that contains visible debris or residue, soap, detergent or other cleaning agents, hazardous waste, or excessive amounts of any pollutant, may not be left on paved surfaces to evaporate because the residues will eventually be discharged to the storm drain system. However, small amounts of wash water that cannot reasonably be collected may be allowed to evaporate on a paved surface.

Wash water from the rinsing of new or used vehicles for dust removal only, using no soap may be discharged to the storm drain or and unpaved area, if the wash water does not flow through oil deposits or other surface contaminants.

Promptly clean up any spill of liquid or solid wastes. Do not hose down an area to clean up a spill, unless the liquid will be completely contained, cleaned up and disposed of to sanitary sewer or offsite as appropriate for the waste type.

If Possible, Either:

1) Use a designated wash area that is paved and protected by permanent or movable berms, dikes, and mats. Contain the wash-water and vacuum it up or otherwise collect it for disposal. Do not allow wash water to leave the property. If the driveway is an avenue for runoff it must be bermed to contain the wash-water.

OR

2) Conduct washing and detailing on a pervious unpaved area such as lawn, dirt, or gravel so that the wash water will be retained and percolate within these areas. Keep washing activities away from storm drains or water conveyances, so that the wash water will infiltrate into the ground and not flow to the storm drains or creeks. This option applies to sites where only one or two vehicles are cleaned every couple of weeks. Do not use this option just before or after a rainstorm.

If Neither of These Approaches is Feasible:

Collect and contain the wash water and prevent it from flowing into any storm drains by sealing or plugging them, or by protecting them with a berm or other means. For information about containing wash water, see the Section titled “Devices That May be Used to Contain and Collect Wash Water.”

BMP-5 Wash Water Disposal:. Do not discharge wash water to storm drain. Once wash water has been collected, either (1) discharge it to the sanitary sewer, or septic system via the sanitary sewer clean-out or sanitary sewer inlet at the point of generation (job site), (2) discharge it to landscaping or other suitable unpaved areas, or (3) collect it in a container for later disposal at an appropriate off-site location. Such locations could include a liquid waste receiving facility at a municipal wastewater treatment plant, such as MRWPCA’s Regional Treatment Plant located north of the City of Marina, or the sanitary sewer at the pressure washer’s place of business using the sewer clean out. Use of disposal options (1) and (2) require the property owner’s permission.

Discharges must be in compliance with the wastewater authority’s Sewer Use Ordinance, or other applicable regulations of the authority. For the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA), the applicable Ordinances are MRWPCA’s Sewer Use Ordinance 2008-01, which can be accessed at http://www.mrwpca.org/ordinances. For the Carmel Area Wastewater District (CAWD), the applicable Ordinance is CAWD’s Ordinance 91-03.

When cleaning surfaces such as buildings and decks without loose paint, sidewalks, or plazas without soap, thorough dry cleanup should normally be sufficient to allow the wash water to be discharged to the sanitary sewer without pretreatment. However, if any debris is present in the wash water it should first pass through a “20 mesh” or finer screen to remove the material before discharging it to the sanitary sewer. The material that is removed should be disposed of in the trash.

Discharges of wash water to a septic system must be approved by the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health. Discharges that contain hazardous waste, have the potential to harm septic systems, or are likely to contaminate groundwater, will not be approved.

With the property owner’s permission wash water can sometimes be disposed of to landscaping or other unpaved areas. If this means of disposal is being considered, first check the slope of the intended disposal area to be sure there will be no runoff into a street, gutter, or waterway. Also, ensure that the wash water will not create a nuisance condition or contain food products or contaminants (i.e. solvents, cleaners, oils, metals, etc.) that may constitute a hazardous waste. If disposal to landscaped areas is being considered, avoid damage to plants and soil by minimizing or eliminating the use of soaps, detergents, and chemicals. In addition, minimize the use of water to avoid wash water overflowing from these areas. Repeated discharges to landscaped areas may result in an accumulation of contaminants, thus damaging vegetation and increasing contaminant levels in the soil. If the soil is very dry, wet it down thoroughly before discharging, so that wash water will soak into the soil instead of running off to the street, gutter, or storm drain. Wash water disposal to land must not create a nuisance condition. Wash water containing garbage, food wastes, or visible trash may not be discharged to land.

Be sure to read cleaning product labels before disposing of wash water. Follow use and disposal instructions carefully. If there is any question as to whether a wash water, or waste material, is considered to be a hazardous material, check with the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials. Depending on the condition of the surface being cleaned, the wastewater generated could be classified as hazardous waste. Some examples include:

1. Wastewater generated from parking lots, storage areas, and gas stations may contain oil, gas, solvents, antifreeze, metals, and/or pesticides.

2. Washing building exteriors with paint made prior to 1978 may contain lead.

Generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase operating costs and limit disposal options. Contact the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health for more information on hazardous waste determination and disposal.

BMPS APPLICABLE TO THE WASHING AND/OR CLEANING OF EXTERIOR SURFACES (E.G. SIDEWALKS, PARKING LOTS, BUILDING EXTERIORS, ETC.)

The Goal and Purpose of these BMPs is to minimize or prevent the discharge of pollutants into storm drains from washing and/or cleaning operations by either (1) discharging wash waters to the sanitary sewer, (2) containing wash water for offsite disposal to a suitable discharge facility, or (3) directing wash water to landscaped or other unpaved areas.

These BMPs apply to cleaning and/or power washing of surfaces including, but not limited to, sidewalks and plazas; parking areas; driveways, drive-thrus; restaurant/food handling cleaning and storage areas; building exteriors, roofs and decks; painted surfaces being cleaned to remove paint or graffiti; and graffiti removal.

Use These Best Management Practices:

BMP-1 Planning: Determine what collection method you will be using and where you are going to discharge wastewater before starting a new job. Identify where all storm drains are located in the vicinity of the jobsite. Never discharge wastewater into a street, ditch, storm drain, or maintenance hole. Obtain all necessary permits and authorizations. If you are going to discharge into the sanitary sewer system at the job site, or on unpaved areas at the job site, always obtain the property owner’s permission.

BMP-2 Surface Pre-Cleaning: Before washing use dry methods for surface pre-cleaning whenever possible. In many cases the amount of wash water that will need to be collected and disposed of can be reduced, if this process is followed:

1. Use absorbents (such as rags, absorbent mats or pads, rice hull ash, cat litter, vermiculite, or sand) to pick up greasy or oily materials and spills.

2. Sweep or vacuum to pick up litter, trash, debris, dirt, and used absorbents.

3. Waste materials from dry cleanup such as absorbents, paint chips, etc. may often be disposed of in the trash. Check with the local solid waste authority to be sure. Rags may be sent to an industrial laundry. Know which pre-cleaning wastes may be hazardous waste

BMP-3 Washing and Cleaning: Minimize the amount of water used during washing and cleaning to reduce the amount of wash water that will need to be disposed. Avoid cleaning products that contain hazardous substances (e.g. hydrofluoric acid, muriatic acid, sodium hydroxide, bleach, etc.) that can create hazardous waste. Avoid acidic, caustic, and other products that may damage paved or coated surfaces. When possible, avoid using soap – even biodegradable soap is harmful to the environment. Before using soap, test to see whether hot water under pressure will do the job. Avoid using solvent-based cleaners (especially chlorinated solvent cleaners).

Beware of pressure washing surfaces that contain lead-based paint, or areas with freestanding liquids (e.g. oil, solvents, antifreeze, etc.). Pressure washing these types of surfaces may generate hazardous waste (e.g., lead-based paint chips, oil/grease, hydrofluoric acid, muriatic acid, etc.). Generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase your operating costs and limit your disposal options. For more information on hazardous waste determination call the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health at (831) 647-7654 or 755-4511.

BMP-4 Wash Water Containment and Collection: Contain and collect the wash water and dispose of it as described below. Decide what is the best method of collection (e.g. berms, storm drain cover mats, containment pools, vacuums/pumps, vacuum boom, inflatable pipe plug, etc). Locate property high and low spots to determine where wash water can be pooled for collection.

A simple and acceptable method for collecting wash water on private property requires only a drain plug, small sump pump, and a length of hose. If a small parking-lot-type catch basin is available, remove the grate, plug the drain pipe (usually 2, 3, or 4 inches in diameter), and place the pump in the catch basin, attached to a garden hose which will discharge to disposal (see section below regarding disposal). Vacuum booms are another option for capturing and collecting wash water. Sand bags can be used to create a barrier around storm drains, and plugs or rubber mats can be used to seal storm drain openings. Other common equipment used for containing and collecting wash water generated during pressure washing activities include: vacuum pumps, booms/berms, portable containment areas, weighted storm drain covers, oil/water separators, holding tanks, portable sump pumps, absorbents, and more. These are described in more detail below.

Avoid mixing non-hazardous wash water with wash water known to contain hazardous levels of pollutants. This will increase the volume of waste that requires treatment and/or disposal as a hazardous waste, thus increasing disposal costs. Do not leave areas of wash water on paved surfaces for evaporation. Sweep up any visible solids and sediments remaining after all the wash water has been collected.

Surface cleaning wastewater that contains visible debris or residue, soap, detergent or other cleaning agents, hazardous waste, or excessive amounts of any pollutant, may not be left on paved surfaces to evaporate because the residues will eventually be discharged to the storm drain system.

For additional information about containing wash water, see the Section titled “Devices That May be Used to Contain and Collect Wash Water.”

BMP-5 Wash Water Disposal:. Do not discharge wash water to storm drain. Once wash water has been collected, either (1) discharge it to the sanitary sewer, or septic system via the sanitary sewer clean-out or sanitary sewer inlet at the point of generation (job site), (2) discharge it to landscaping or other suitable unpaved areas, or (3) collect it in a container for later disposal at an appropriate off-site location. Such locations could include a liquid waste receiving facility at a municipal wastewater treatment plant, such as MRWPCA’s Regional Treatment Plant located north of the City of Marina, or the sanitary sewer at the pressure washer’s place of business using the sewer clean out. Use of disposal options (1) and (2) require the property owner’s permission.

Discharges to the sanitary sewer must comply with the discharge requirements of the appropriate wastewater authority. The requirements of the two principal wastewater authorities within the area covered by the Monterey Regional Storm Water Management Program (MRSWMP) are described in the Section titled “Requirements for Discharge to the Sanitary Sewer.”

When cleaning surfaces such as buildings and decks without loose paint, sidewalks, or plazas without soap, thorough dry cleanup should normally be sufficient to allow the wash water to be discharged to the sanitary sewer without pretreatment. However, if any debris is present in the wash water it should first pass through a “20 mesh” or finer screen to remove the material before discharging it to the sanitary sewer. The material that is removed should be disposed of in the trash.

Discharges of surface cleaning wastewater to a septic system must be approved by the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health. Discharges that contain hazardous waste, have the potential to harm septic systems, or are likely to contaminate groundwater, will not be approved.

With the property owner’s permission wash water can sometimes be disposed of to landscaping or other unpaved areas. If this means of disposal is being considered, first check the slope of the intended disposal area to be sure there will be no runoff into a street, gutter, or waterway. Also, ensure that the wash water will not create a nuisance condition or contain food products or contaminants (i.e. solvents, cleaners, oils, metals, etc.) that may constitute a hazardous waste. If disposal to landscaped areas is being considered, avoid damage to plants and soil by minimizing or eliminating the use of soaps, detergents, and chemicals. In addition, minimize the use of water to avoid wash water overflowing from these areas. Repeated discharges to landscaped areas may result in an accumulation of contaminants, thus damaging vegetation and increasing contaminant levels in the soil. If the soil is very dry, wet it down thoroughly before discharging, so that wash water will soak into the soil instead of running off to the street, gutter, or storm drain. Wash water disposal to land must not create a nuisance condition. Wash water containing garbage, food wastes, or visible trash may not be discharged to land.

Be sure to read cleaning product labels before disposing of wash water. Follow use and disposal instructions carefully. If there is any question as to whether a wash water, or waste material, is considered to be a hazardous material, check with the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health to make this determination and properly dispose of these materials. Depending on the condition of the surface being cleaned, the wastewater generated could be classified as hazardous waste. Some examples include:

3. Wastewater generated from parking lots, storage areas, and gas stations may contain oil, gas, solvents, antifreeze, metals, and/or pesticides.

4. Washing building exteriors with paint made prior to 1978 may contain lead.

Generating hazardous waste may dramatically increase operating costs and limit disposal options. Contact the Monterey County Division of Environmental Health for more information on hazardous waste determination and disposal.

DEVICES THAT MAY BE USED TO CONTAIN AND COLLECT WASH WATER

The following are examples of devices that may be used to contain and collect wash water. The collection devices described are not endorsed and are only provided as a reference tool. In addition, there may be other containment devices available, which are not listed. Note: When working with electrical equipment in wet environments, it is important to understand and comply with applicable health/safety and electrical codes, and well as utilize appropriate safety equipment (e.g. Ground Fault Interrupters, etc.)

For information about where equipment and materials of these types can be obtained, see the Section titled “Sources of Equipment and Supplies.”

Berms

Berms may be used to prevent wastewater from entering a storm drain by placing a protective barrier around the storm drain inlet, thus allowing wastewater to pool around the inlet prior to proper collection and disposal. This type of containment may be less effective or ineffective when the storm drain is located at the bottom of a slope and/or a large amount of wastewater is generated.

Storm Drain Covers/Mats

These devices are placed on top of the storm drain cover grate, creating a quick seal, thus preventing wastewater from entering the storm drain system. Storm drain covers/mats (magnetic vinyl mats, PVC drain covers, polyurethane mats, and others) allow wastewater to accumulate on top of it until the pressure washing activity is complete and the wash water can be collected for proper disposal. Storm drain covers/mats are frequently used along with a vacuum device that diverts wastewater into the sanitary sewer.

Containment Pools

A portable or temporary containment pool is another option which may be used to collect wash water. Containment pools are easy to assemble, provide an immediate work area, and allow wash water to be collected in a manner that will prevent pollutants from entering the storm drain system. Containment pools vary in size and material and can also be used for washing equipment and vehicles.

Vacuums/Pumps

Devices such as wet/dry vacuums, sump pumps, and vacuum pumps may be used to collect and dispose of wash water after pressure washing. Vacuum devices typically have an extension (vacuum boom) which allows the water to be collected efficiently. In addition, many vacuum devices are equipped with a hose that can run from the pump to the sanitary sewer, a treatment device, or a holding tank depending on the disposal method.

Vacuum Boom

Vacuum booms are an attachment for the vacuum device. The boom typically rests flush on the ground and draws wastewater through small holes on the bottom of the boom. In addition, different varieties of vacuum booms are available for areas with steep slopes or rough terrain.

Inflatable Pipe Plug

Inflatable pipe plugs prevent wash water from entering a storm drain system by blocking the pipe leading from the drain inlet. Unlike the storm drain mats/covers that block the storm drain grates, the inflatable pipe plug is inserted into the storm drain pipe and uses the inlet structure beneath the grate to collect the wash water. Once inserted, the plug is inflated to make a snug fit. Once the wash water has been contained, it can be collected and disposed by using a portable pump device. Note: inflatable pipe plugs should only be used in storm drains on private property. They are not authorized to be used in public storm drain inlets or pipes.

CONSTRUCTION SITE BMPs

This guidance specifies Best Management Practices (BMPs) for construction sites that shall be employed to protect water quality during construction. At a minimum, every construction site shall employ applicable BMPs outlined below. The additional best management practices, measures and controls described below shall be employed as applicable and to the maximum extent practicable to prevent pollutants from entering stormwater runoff. For additional details on items shown with an asterisk (*), see Section 4 “Sources of Additional Information” in this Guidance Series.

Section 1.0 Construction Site Planning BMPs

Project proponent must develop and implement a plan to manage storm water and non-storm water discharges from the site at all times. Grading during the wet season must be minimized and should coincide with seasonal dry weather periods to the maximum extent practicable. If grading does occur during the wet season, project proponent is required to implement additional BMPs for any rain events which may occur.

1.1 Site Plan

1.1.1 Plan the development to fit the topography, soils, drainage pattern and natural vegetation of the site.

1.1.2 Remove existing vegetation only when absolutely necessary.

1.1.3 Delineate clearing limits, easements, setbacks, sensitive or critical areas, trees, drainage courses, and buffer zones to prevent excessive or unnecessary disturbances and exposure.

1.1.4 Avoid construction on steep slopes*

1.1.5 Minimize cuts and fills*

1.1.6 Align temporary and permanent roads and driveways along slope contours*

1.2 Other Measures

1.2.1 Phase grading operations to reduce disturbed areas and time of exposure

1.2.2 Avoid excavation and grading during wet weather

1.2.3 Winterize construction site*

Section 2.0 Erosion and Sediment Control BMPs

Project proponent must stabilize all slopes and emphasize erosion prevention as the most important measure for keeping sediment on site during construction, and must utilize sediment controls as a supplement to erosion prevention for keeping sediment on-site during construction, and never as the single or primary method.

2.1 Soil Cover

2.1.1 Install cover materials such as vegetative debris, mulch, crushed stone, geotextile fabric, erosion control blankets*

2.1.2 Use soil stabilizers as appropriate*

2.1.3 Use temporary seeding and planting to reduce erosion potential*

2.1.4 Temporarily stabilize and reseed disturbed soil areas as rapidly as possible

2.1.5 Permanently re-vegetate or landscape as early as maximally practicable

2.2 Tracking Control (for sites where on-site room allows for these measures)

2.2.1 Construct stabilized access roads and entrances*

2.2.2 Construct entrance/exit tire wash*

2.2.3 When cleaning sediments from streets, driveways and paved areas on construction sites, use dry sweeping methods where possible. If water must be used to flush pavement, collect runoff in temporary storage tanks to settle out sediments prior to discharge to the storm drains, and protect storm drain inlets.

2.3 Structures to Control and Convey Runoff

2.3.1 Earth dikes, drainage swales and ditches*

2.3.2 Slope drains and subsurface drains*

2.2.3 Velocity dissipation devices*

2.4.1 Slope roughening/terracing/rounding*

2.4.2 Level spreader*

2.5 BMPs to Capture Sediment

2.5.1 Use terracing, riprap, sand bags, rocks, straw bales, and/or temporary vegetation on slopes to reduce runoff velocity and trap sediments. Do not use asphalt rubble or other demolition debris for this purpose.

2.5.2 Protect storm drain inlets from sediment-laden runoff. Storm drain inlet protection devices include sand bag barriers, filter fabric fences, block and gravel filters, and excavated drop inlet sediment traps.*

2.5.3 When dewatering the site, remove sediment from the discharge using filtration methods. Mobile units specifically designed for construction site dewatering can be rented for this purpose.

2.6 Other Controls (as required)

2.6.1 Silt fence*

2.6.2 Straw bale barrier (other than at storm drain inlets)*

2.6.3 Sand bag barrier*

2.6.4 Brush or rock filter*

2.6.5 Sediment trap*

2.6.6 Temporary sediment basin*

Section 3.0 General Site and Materials Management

3.1 All Construction Sites

3.1.1 Identify all storm drains, drainage swales, channels, sloped areas, and creeks located on or near the construction site and make sure all subcontractors are aware of their locations and use appropriate methods to prevent pollutants from entering them.

3.1.2 Clean up leaks, drips, and other spills immediately.

3.1.3 Refuel vehicles and heavy equipment in one designated location.

3.1.4 Wash vehicles at an appropriate off-site facility. If equipment must be washed on-site, do not use soaps, solvents, degreasers, or steam cleaning equipment, and prevent wash water from entering the storm drain.

3.1.5 Never wash down pavement or surfaces where materials have spilled. Use dry cleanup methods whenever possible.

3.1.6 Avoid contaminating clean runoff from areas adjacent to your site by using berms and/or temporary or permanent drainage ditches to divert water flow around the site.

3.1.7 Keep materials out of the rain. Schedule clearing or heavy earth moving activities for periods of dry weather. Cover exposed piles of soil, construction materials and wastes with plastic sheeting or temporary roofs. Before it rains, sweep and remove materials from surfaces that drain to storm drains, creeks, or channels.

3.1.8 Place trash cans around the site to reduce litter. Dispose of non-hazardous construction wastes in covered dumpsters or recycling receptacles. Recycle leftover materials whenever possible.

3.1.9 Dispose of all wastes properly. Materials that can not be reused or recycled must be taken to an appropriate landfill or disposed of as hazardous waste.

3.1.10 Cover open dumpsters with plastic sheeting or a tarp during rainy weather. Secure the sheeting or tarp around the outside of the dumpster. If your dumpster has a cover, close it.

3.1.11 Train your employees and inform subcontractors about the stormwater requirements and their own responsibilities.

3.2 Construction Projects Involving Paint Work

3.2.1 Non-hazardous paint chips and dust from dry stripping and sand blasting may be swept up or collected in plastic drop cloths and disposed of as trash. Chemical paint stripping residue and chips and dust from marine paints or paints containing lead or tributyl tin must be disposed of as a hazardous waste.

3.2.2 When stripping or cleaning building exteriors with high-pressure water, cover or berm storm drain inlets. If possible (and allowed by your local wastewater authority), collect (mop or vacuum) building cleaning water and discharge to the sanitary sewer.

3.2.3 Never clean brushes or rinse paint containers into a street, gutter, storm drain, or creek.

3.2.4 For water-based paints, paint out brushes to the extent possible and rinse to a drain leading to the sanitary sewer (i.e., indoor plumbing).

3.2.5 For oil-based paints, paint out brushes to the extent possible, and filter and reuse thinners and solvents. Dispose of unusable thinners and residue as hazardous waste.

3.2.6 Recycle, return to supplier or donate unwanted water-based (latex) paint.

3.2.7 Dried latex paint may be disposed of in the garbage.

3.2.8 Unwanted oil-based paint (that is not recycled), thinners, and sludges must be disposed of as hazardous waste.

3.3 Construction Projects Involving Cement and Concrete Work

3.3.1 Avoid mixing excess amounts of fresh concrete or cement mortar on-site.

3.3.2 Store dry and wet materials under cover, protected form rainfall and runoff.

3.3.3 Wash out concrete transit mixers only in designated wash-out areas where the water will flow into settling ponds or onto dirt or stockpiles of aggregate base or sand. Pump water from settling ponds to the sanitary sewer, where allowed. Whenever possible, recycle washout by pumping back into mixers for reuse. Never dispose of washout into the street, storm drains, drainage ditches, or creeks.

3.3.4 Whenever possible, return contents of mixer barrel to the yard for recycling. Dispose of small amounts of excess concrete, grout, and mortar in the trash.

3.4 Construction Projects Involving Roadwork/Pavement Construction

3.4.1 Apply concrete, asphalt, and seal coat during dry weather to prevent contaminants from contacting stormwater runoff.

3.4.2 Cover storm drain inlets and manholes when paving or applying seal coat, slurry seal, fog seal, etc.

3.4.3 Always park paving machines over drip pans or absorbent materials, since they tend to drip continuously.

3.4.4 When making saw-cuts in pavement, use as little water as possible. Cover each storm drain inlet completely with filter fabric during the sawing operation and contain the slurry by placing straw bales, sandbags, or gravel dams around the catch basins. Use a wet-dry vacuum to pick up slurry prior to drying or after the liquid drains or evaporates, shovel or vacuum the slurry residue from the pavement or gutter and remove from site.

3.4.5 Wash down exposed aggregate concrete only when the wash water can: (1) flow onto a dirt area; (2) drain onto a bermed surface from which it can be pumped and disposed of properly; or (3) be vacuumed from the area along the curb where sediment has accumulated by blocking a storm drain inlet.

3.4.6 Allow aggregate rinse to settle, and pump the water to the sanitary sewer if allowed by your local wastewater authority.

3.4.7 Never wash sweepings from exposed aggregate concrete into a street or storm drain. Collect and return to aggregate base stockpile, or dispose with trash.

3.4.8 Recycle broken concrete and asphalt.

POST-CONSTRUCTION BMPS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT

The focus of this guidance is post-construction BMPs for new development or redevelopment projects. Post-construction BMPs are grouped into three types:

1. Site Planning Measures that avoid or reduce disturbance of the site and limit the addition of impervious surfaces;

2. Pollution Prevention and Source Control Measures that reduce or eliminate potential future sources of pollutants; and

3. Treatment Control Measures that treat polluted runoff from new development/redevelopment sites.

This guidance is focused strictly on specific controls that can be incorporated into individual development projects to avoid or reduce the pollutants from the particular project. Where appropriate, pros and cons are described along with typical conditions under which these controls have been found to be effective.

The best opportunities for post-construction controls are available in larger projects or when implemented on a regional basis, and most of this guidance emphasizes controls that can be introduced in larger new development/redevelopment projects through the discretionary approval process. The second section of this guidance presents a list of controls that can be employed for small infill-type projects which are subject only to the ministerial approval process where the opportunities are limited.

Projects requiring discretionary approval from the local jurisdiction include almost all projects except minor infill development. This discretionary approval process is commonly the design review process, although other discretionary approvals such as a use permit or a subdivision map approval may also be triggered depending on the characteristics of the project.

Projects requiring ministerial approval are small improvement projects that conform to the site zoning requirements and include either a new single-family unit or minor modifications to an existing single family unit or a single structure. Such projects typically do not need discretionary approval, but will in all cases need a ministerial permit, such as a building or a grading permit.

Post-Construction BMPs for Projects Requiring Discretionary Approvals

Site Planning BMPs

This group of post-construction controls includes site planning to protect sensitive resources at or near the site and the use of alternate paving and cover materials to reduce the amount of impervious surfaces added by a new development. Studies have shown that in single-family residential areas, streets are the primary producers of runoff, and sidewalks and lawns, if properly vegetated, are a minor source. In multi-family developments, streets, parking lots and roofs generate similar quantities of runoff. In commercial/industrial areas, parking lots and roofs are the main generators of runoff. It follows then that to reduce impervious surfaces, in single-family residential areas reduction of street width and driveway lengths should be the primary strategy, while in multi-family developments and industrial/commercial areas, strategies should focus on reducing parking lots and the footprint of buildings. For more information on site planning, refer to “Start at the Source Residential Site Planning and Design Guidance Manual for Stormwater Quality Protection”, available from BASMAA.

Site planning BMPs that minimize impervious surface and maximize infiltration are described below:

1. Cluster development – Concentrate the development on a limited portion of the site and leave the remaining portion undisturbed. This should be used where appropriate without creating other hazards such as those of access during emergencies.

2. Preserve natural drainages – This measure includes not filling in the natural drainage features at the site, maintaining invert/streambeds to maximize capacity, and providing vegetated setbacks or buffer strips outside of the maximum water surface level. Main concerns are related to safety especially of children and future need for mosquito/pest control.

3. Reduce sidewalk widths, especially in low-traffic areas – This control provides limited runoff reduction benefits, and reduction of width may not possible due to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.

1. Avoid curb and gutter along driveways and streets where appropriate – This is recommended in areas where flooding and ponding of water creating mosquito habitat is not a problem. Replace with swales.

2. Use alternate paving materials/porous/permeable materials, where appropriate – This measure includes use of alternate paving materials (e.g., porous asphalt, pervious concrete, pavers), landscaping, mulch, gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover, and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement. Pavers are recommended for driveways, walkways, and patios in single-family residences where the site does not generate highly polluted runoff (that could contaminate groundwater if it were to infiltrate) and where ADA requirements do not have to be met. In non-residential areas, pavers are recommended for emergency access roads, overflow parking areas, and non-handicapped parking stalls. (Note: Some types of alternate paving materials may not be suitable where heavy loads (e.g. truck movement) are anticipated.) For more information on alternate paving materials, see Post-Construction Controls for New Development Fact Sheets available from BASMAA.

3. Reduce the length of driveways or infiltrate driveway runoff – This control applies mainly to single-family residential units. If reduction of the driveway length is not possible, grade and construct driveway so that runoff from driveway is directed to the adjacent landscaped areas.

4. Reduce street width by eliminating on-street parking (where such actions do not pose a safety hazard) – This measure can be generally used in new residential areas. In addition to reducing the impervious area, this control has the added benefit of removing cars from streets and making street sweeping easier and more effective. If on-street parking in residential areas is eliminated, the developer must provide adequate off-street visitor parking.

5. Reduce alley width or use alternate materials for paving alleys – If alleys are included in a proposed development, width should be minimized or alternate paving materials should be used.

6. Set aside open space – This control is recommended for all developments (residential and non-residential). The main concern with open space relates to maintenance, weed control, and fire prevention. This group includes controls that can be incorporated into new development/redevelopment projects to avoid pollution in the long run by eliminating sources.

Pollution Prevention and Source Control BMPs

This group of BMPs includes controls that can be incorporated into new development/redevelopment projects to avoid pollution by eliminating sources.

1. Provide green areas where pets can be exercised – Pet excrement is a major source of bacteria in urban runoff. Provide green areas in new residential developments where people can walk their pets and keep pet excrement away from sidewalks and streets.

2. Install landscaping or other cover – Clearing and grading of surfaces in new development can increase potential for erosion. Install landscaping or other cover materials to minimize erosion from graded surfaces. Use of native plant materials is recommended because native plants require less maintenance and irrigation, and are typically more resistant to fires than non-native grasses. Native plants do take longer to cover slopes, therefore during the first few years, supplemental protection (erosion blanket, mulch, etc.) will be necessary.

3. Incorporate low-maintenance landscaping – At sites where erosion may not be a concern but landscaping is proposed as part of the development, use low-maintenance landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application. Assistance in identifying the types of trees, shrubs, and ground cover that would work in the community, based on local climatic and soil conditions, can be obtained from garden centers, landscapers, and other sources.

4. Label storm drains to discourage dumping – Label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language (such as: “NO DUMPING – DRAINS TO OCEAN”) and/or graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping. Signs and prohibitive language and/or graphical icons, which prohibit illegal dumping, must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area. Legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained.

5. Where possible, eliminate gutters/roof drains or direct runoff to landscaped areas – Roof drains can be eliminated only in one to two-story buildings. Where these cannot be eliminated, direct the downspout of the gutter to a landscaped area or into an infiltration trench. Install several gutters to distribute the flow.

6. Construct designated vehicle wash area – In new residential developments involving more than 50 units, construct a designated vehicle wash area so that the runoff from vehicle washing can be property treated and/or disposed. Contact the local wastewater authority to determine if the discharge can be plumbed to the sanitary sewer. If not, provide appropriate treatment and disposal of this runoff.

7. Where possible use underground parking and the construction of multi-storied parking structures – For commercial projects build underground or multi-story parking structures so that not only is impervious surface minimized but the parking surfaces are under a roof and not exposed to storm water.

8. Where possible use cooperative or shared parking – For commercial areas this may be a cooperative effort between commercial entities or between commercial entities and the City.

9. Use alternate paving materials for parking lots – This control is recommended for overflow parking areas and for less frequently used parking spaces (typically these are spaces along the periphery of the parking lot that will not have to meet ADA requirements and due to low usage there will be less concern regarding pollution of groundwater through infiltration of stall runoff).

10. Use measures to reduce building footprint and increase use of taller structures (where appropriate) – This control is recommended for commercial and municipal structures, where it would also be consistent with other City planning and building requirements.

11. Berm waste storage areas – Grade and pave outdoor waste receptacle areas to prevent run-on of storm water, and install a low containment berm around it. Alternately, construct a covered enclosure with wash-down capabilities plumbed into the sanitary sewer, after first contacting the local wastewater authority to verify that this practice will be acceptable.

12. Install valves on storm drain inlets in loading dock areas – At commercial/industrial facilities where loading docks are proposed, install a valve(s) to control runoff in the event of spills.

Treatment BMPs

This group of BMPs includes controls that can be built at new development and redevelopment sites to capture and treat the polluted runoff before it enters the City’s storm drain system or other receiving waters. Those BMPs which are feasible for the proposed development should be incorporated into its design.

Treatment control design standards, depending on the type of units, are based on either treating a given volume of runoff (e.g., first 0.5 inch of runoff) or a peak flow rate associated with a design storm. The volume approach is often utilized for small catchments where there tends to be a “first flush” condition (e.g., a parking lot). Design storms for storm water controls may be small (e.g. recurrence intervals of 3 months to 2 years) compared to flood control designs standards because of the need to minimize the size and cost of the unit, and because most runoff is associated with the more frequent smaller events. Treatment controls must be designed such that volumes and flows in excess of the design standard bypass the unit, otherwise there is the possibility of aggravating flooding and also causing re-suspension of previously captured sediments or other constituents. Also, all of the treatment BMPs described below require some inspection, maintenance, and disposal of solids to ensure optimum performance and often to avoid flooding.

1. Rooftop Catchment Systems – These are rooftops which can sometimes be designed into large commercial and industrial sites to pool stormwater which, following the storm, evaporates. This effectively eliminates rooftop runoff from the storm drain system, and thereby reduces the hydraulically-connected impervious area. Another function of these systems is to slow down the runoff to reduce peaks. Problems with rooftop catchment systems are mainly related to leakage.

2. Vegetated Filter Strips – Vegetated filter strips, buffer strips, or riparian buffer zones are strips of vegetation placed between receiving waters (e.g., along streams) and pollutant sources. The effectiveness of the strips depend primarily on the width of the strip, and the vegetation type and condition. Strips of 100-300 feet in width are often considered. Such strips have been successfully applied to urban, agricultural, and forestry situations. Vegetation type selection must take into account the climate and usually should be drought-resistant. Maintenance is primarily annual cutting. Such strips are recommended for developments located along receiving waters such as streams, rivers and lakes, but outside the flood control boundary.

3. Vegetated Swales – Swales are shallow low gradient channels that are vegetated. They are commonly applied in rural residential areas in lieu of traditional curb/gutters and underground stormwater drainage pipes. Water quality improvement is achieved primarily through filtration, and performance is dependent on the swale hydraulic capacity and vegetation type and condition. Influent water should be relatively free of coarse sediment to avoid burying the vegetation. Where sediment loads are of concern, sediment settling basins can be provided upstream of the swales. Maintenance consists primarily of vegetation management and settling basin cleanouts. Swales are generally recommended for low-density residential developments located in relatively flat terrain.

4. Infiltration Basins – Infiltration basins store and infiltrate stormwater into the surficial groundwater aquifer. Performance is critically dependent on soil porosity and adequate depth to groundwater. Such conditions are typical of inland valleys, in contrast to low lying coastal areas. In order to maintain recharge rates, influent water may require pretreatment to remove sediments. Infiltration basins are effective at reducing runoff rates and volumes and can provide water supply benefits through aquifer recharge. Maintenance primarily consists of periodic removal of accumulated trash, debris and sediments to maintain recharge rates. Infiltration basins are generally recommended in areas where the depth to groundwater is relatively high and the soils are highly pervious. Where such conditions exist, this technology is generally applicable to the entire range of urban development, although the potential for groundwater contamination is often of concern in industrial areas.

5. Infiltration Trenches – Infiltration trenches are shallow drains filled with high porosity materials (e.g. gravel). Stormwater discharged to these trenches is stored during the runoff event and infiltrates into the groundwater during dry weather periods. As with infiltration basins, performance requires porous sub-soils and adequate depth to the groundwater table. The acceptability and designs of infiltration trenches must take into consideration the potential for infiltrating water to adversely affect soil strength around foundations. Infiltration trenches are generally not recommended for roof runoff near buildings because of building code requirements; but can be effective as part of the overall open channel drainage system.

6. Dry Detention Ponds/Basins – These are basins designed to temporarily store and treat storm water prior to gradually releasing it downstream. Such basins can provide flood control and storm water treatment benefits. Treatment performance depends on storage volume (12-24 hours of residence time is considered a good rule of thumb), and good circulation (avoidance of short circuiting). A major factor limiting good performance is that, during larger storm runoff events, water entering a dry basin may re-suspend previously settled material in which case the ponds may act as a source of sediment and associated chemicals. In general dry basins are not as effective as wet basins (discussed below), however, in certain arid areas, wet basins are not feasible. Performance of dry basins can be improved by incorporating slow release outlet structures. Such basins are generally applicable to residential, commercial, and industrial development in areas where there is insufficient runoff to maintain wet basins.

7. Retention Ponds/Wet Basins – These are basins that contain a permanent pool of water. Such ponds can provide flood control, ecological, and water quality benefits. The performance of wet basins depends on the size of the basin, watershed characteristics, and influent conditions. The primary treatment process in retention ponds is settling. Maintenance is required for removing debris, vegetation management, and maintaining the inlet and outlet structures. Accumulation rates in such basins typically require that accumulated sediment be removed about once every 10-20 years. Retention ponds are generally applicable to most urban situations, as long as there is adequate space for the facility and acceptable geological conditions.

8. Constructed/Restored Wetlands – In addition to providing flood control and water supply benefits through artificial recharge of groundwater, constructed wetlands designed for stormwater management provide water quality benefits through a number of processes including sedimentation, filtration, absorption, biological processes, and nutrient uptake. Pollutant removal performance depends on the size of the wetland relative to the watershed, the design of the wetland, and the type and composition of wetland vegetation. Wetlands also provide additional ecological and recreational benefits. If a significant amount of sedimentation is anticipated, a deep settling basin could be constructed (which the water would enter prior to reaching the wetland). The basin would require periodic maintenance to remove accumulated sediment. Constructed wetlands require maintenance, especially in the first 5-10 years during which vegetation is growing and natural seeding is occurring. Providing suitable hydrologic conditions for vegetation growth and water treatment is key to successful performance of constructed wetlands. Constructed wetlands are generally applicable to most urban situations, as long as there is adequate space for the facility, an adequate source of water, and appropriate soils. In California, such wetlands would likely be seasonal in nature. The cost of urban lands often preclude this type of treatment in the more densely developed portions of urban areas.

A variation of this control is the use of existing wetlands for urban runoff treatment. Existing wetlands at or downstream of a new development/redevelopment project can be enhanced to improve hydrology, and runoff from the development project can be directed to the wetlands. Note that the dry detention ponds/basins, retention ponds/wet basins, and the constructed wetlands need to be periodically monitored for accumulation of toxic materials, and provisions made for cleanout and disposal pretreatment may be added (to remove heavy sediment trash and debris) to reduce maintenance. If a significant amount of sediment is anticipated, a deep settling basin could be constructed. This would also need to be periodically cleaned out to maintain capacity.

9. Filtration Systems – Filtration systems convey stormwater through filter media (e.g., sand, compost, charcoal) to treat the storm water. The chemicals treated vary depending on the type of media and may include fine sediment, colloidal material, hydrocarbons, organics, nutrients and dissolved metals. Such systems come in many sizes and designs including: (1) inserts placed in individual storm drain inlets, (2) linear units that treat stormwater from small impervious areas such as parking lots, and (3) large 1-2 acre sand filters that treat runoff from urban catchments. Filters are effective as long as the capacity of the filter is not exceeded, and the filter is not allowed to clog. Filter inserts are particularly problematic in this regard, and recent testing and evaluation questions their applicability where material in runoff will clog or block the filter. In stormwater applications filter systems are required to remove blocking materials (leaves, trash, debris, sediments, oil and grease) and storage to better manage flow rates. Experience to date with filter type inserts for drain inlets suggest that the units are easily clogged with sediment and debris, with resultant bypassing of most of the flows. Therefore, inserts are not recommended unless frequent inspection and cleaning is performed. Filtration systems will have limited application in small well-maintained parking lots.

10. Oil/Grit Separators – Oil/grit (gravity) separators are usually multi-chambered treatment units that are placed underground and treat stormwater from a drainage catchment. The individual chambers often are designed to trap grit and floatables, and adsorb hydrocarbons. Flows in excess of the design capacity should be diverted around the unit, otherwise there is the possibility that sediment previously trapped in the chambers will be re-suspended and flushed downstream. Inspection and maintenance is required to ensure that the units are not filling up with sediment, as accumulation can affect performance. Traditional gravity oil/water separators that utilize skimming devices and coalescing plates (to increase droplet size and capture) are generally not applicable to stormwater conditions where total hydrocarbon concentrations are generally less than 10 mg/l. The performance of oil/grit separators varies depending on the chosen design. Research should be done before selecting any separators to verify that they will perform as desired. In general, oil/grit separators are useful only at sites where there are chances that oil spills could occur and to a limited degree at development sites that have high oil and grease loadings such as petroleum storage yards and vehicle storage facilities.

Post-Construction BMPs for Projects Requiring Ministerial Approvals

1. Incorporate low-maintenance landscaping – Use low-maintenance drought-tolerant landscaping that does not require frequent fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application.

2. Label storm drains to discourage dumping – Label all storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area with prohibitive language (such as: “NO DUMPING – DRAINS TO OCEAN”) and/or graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping. Signs and prohibitive language and/or graphical icons, which prohibit illegal dumping, must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area. Legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained.

3. Where possible, direct gutters to landscaped areas – Roof drains may be eliminated only in one to two-story buildings. Where these cannot be eliminated, direct the downspout of the gutter to landscaped area or into an infiltration trench. Install several gutters to distribute the flow. Note that roof drains may be eliminated in residential and some commercial areas only, and should not be eliminated in industrial areas.

4. Use alternate paving materials/porous/permeable materials, where appropriate – Use alternate paving materials (pavers), landscaping, mulch, gravel and cobbles where appropriate to provide ground cover, and reduce the use of asphalt or other impervious pavement. Pavers are recommended for driveways, walkways, and patios in single-family residences where the site does not generate highly polluted runoff (that could contaminate groundwater if it were to infiltrate) and where ADA requirements do not have to be met. In non-residential areas, pavers are recommended for emergency access roads, overflow parking areas, and non-handicapped parking stalls. These are not recommended where heavy loads (e.g. truck movement) are anticipated. For more information on alternate paving materials, see Post-Construction Controls for New Development Fact Sheets available from BASMAA.

Providing Proof of Ongoing Post-Construction BMP Maintenance

As part of project review, if a project applicant is required to include Structural or Treatment Control BMPs in project plans, the City will require that the applicant provide verification of maintenance provisions through such means as may be appropriate, including, but not limited to legal agreements, covenants, CEQA mitigation requirements and/or Conditional Use Permits.

For all properties, the verification will include the developer’s signed statement, as part of the project application, accepting responsibility for all structural and treatment control BMP maintenance until the time the property is transferred and, where applicable, a signed agreement from the public or private entity assuming responsibility for Structural or Treatment Control BMP maintenance. A sample agreement is included in Attachment A at the end of this section.

The transfer of property to a private or public owner shall have conditions requiring the recipient to assume responsibility for maintenance of any Structural or Treatment Control BMP included in the sales or lease agreement for that property. The condition of transfer shall include a provision that the property owners conduct maintenance inspection of all Structural or Treatment Control BMPs at least once a year and retain proof of inspection. For residential properties where the Structural or Treatment Control BMPs are located within a common area which will be maintained by a homeowner’s association, language regarding the responsibility for maintenance shall be included in the projects conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs).

Printed educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on what storm water management facilities are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how the necessary maintenance can be performed. The transfer of this information shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property.

1. Design Standards Applicable to All Categories:

a. Peak Storm Water Runoff Discharge Rates. Post-development peak storm water runoff discharge rates shall not exceed the estimated pre-development rate for developments where the increased peak storm water discharge rate will result in increased potential for downstream erosion.

b. Conserve Natural Areas. If determined appropriate by the City, the following items must be implemented in the site layout during the subdivision design and approval process, consistent with applicable General Plan and Local Area Plan policies:

1) Concentrate or cluster Development on portions of a site while leaving the remaining land in a natural undisturbed condition.

2) Limit clearing and grading of native vegetation at a site to the minimum amount needed to build lots, allow access, and provide fire protection.

4) Promote natural vegetation by using parking lot islands and other landscaped areas.

5) Preserve riparian areas and wetlands.

c. Minimize Storm Water Pollutants of Concern. The development must be designed so as to minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the introduction of pollutants of concern that may result in significant impacts, generated from site runoff of directly connected impervious areas (DCIA), to the storm water conveyance system as approved by the building official. Pollutants of concern consist of any pollutants that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: current loadings or historic deposits of the pollutant are impacting the beneficial uses of a receiving water, elevated levels of the pollutant are found in sediments of a receiving water and/or have the potential to bioaccumulate in organisms therein, or the detectable inputs of the pollutant are at concentrations or loads considered potentially toxic to humans and/or flora and fauna. In meeting this specific requirement, “minimization of the pollutants of concern” will require the incorporation of a BMP or combination of BMPs best suited to maximize the reduction of pollutant loadings in that runoff to the Maximum Extent Practicable.

d. Protect Slopes and Channels. Project plans must include BMPs consistent with local codes, ordinances, or other regulatory mechanism and these Design Standards to decrease the potential of slopes and/or channels from eroding and impacting storm water runoff:

1) Convey runoff safely from the tops of slopes and stabilize disturbed slopes.

2) Utilize natural drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable.

3) Stabilize permanent channel crossings.

4) Vegetate slopes with native or drought tolerant vegetation, as appropriate.

5) Install energy dissipaters, such as riprap, at the outlets of new storm drains, culverts, conduits, or channels that enter unlined channels in accordance with applicable specifications to minimize erosion, with the approval of all agencies with jurisdiction, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Department of Fish and Game.

e. Provide Storm Drain System Stenciling and Signage. All storm drain inlets and catch basins within the project area must be stenciled with prohibitive language (such as: “NO DUMPING – DRAINS TO OCEAN”) and/or graphical icons to discourage illegal dumping. Signs and prohibitive language and/or graphical icons, which prohibit illegal dumping, must be posted at public access points along channels and creeks within the project area. Legibility of stencils and signs must be maintained.

f. Properly Design Outdoor Material Storage Areas. Outdoor material storage areas refer to storage areas or storage facilities solely for the storage of materials. Where proposed project plans include outdoor areas for storage of materials that may contribute pollutants to the storm water conveyance system, the following Structural or Treatment BMPs are required:

1) Materials with the potential to contaminate storm water must be: (a) placed in an enclosure such as, but not limited to, a cabinet, shed, or similar structure that prevents contact with runoff or spillage to the storm water conveyance system; or (b) protected by secondary containment structures such as berms, dikes, or curbs.

2) The storage area must be paved and sufficiently impervious to contain leaks and spills.

3) The storage area must have a roof or awning to minimize collection of storm water within the secondary containment area.

g. Properly Design Trash Storage Areas. A trash storage area refers to an area where a trash receptacle or receptacles (dumpsters) are located for use as a repository for solid wastes. All trash storage areas must meet the following Structural or Treatment Control BMP requirements (individual single family residences are exempt from these requirements):

1) Trash container areas must have drainage from adjoining roofs and pavement diverted around the area(s).

2) Trash container areas must be screened or walled to prevent off-site transport of trash.

h. Provide Proof of Ongoing BMP Maintenance. If a project applicant has included or is required to include, Structural or Treatment Control BMPs in project plans, the applicant shall provide verification of maintenance provisions through such means as may be considered appropriate by the City, including but not limited to legal agreements, covenants, CEQA mitigation requirements and/or Conditional Use Permits. For all properties, the verification will include the developer’s signed statement, as part of the project application, accepting responsibility for all structural and treatment control BMP maintenance until the time the property is transferred and, where applicable, a signed agreement from the public entity assuming responsibility for Structural or Treatment Control BMP maintenance. The transfer of property to a private or public owner must have conditions requiring the recipient to assume responsibility for maintenance of any Structural or Treatment Control BMP to be included in the sales or lease agreement for that property, and will be the owner’s responsibility. The condition of transfer shall include a provision that the property owners conduct maintenance inspection of all Structural or Treatment Control BMPs at least once a year and retain proof of inspection. For residential properties where the Structural or Treatment Control BMPs are located within a common area which will be maintained by a homeowner’s association, language regarding the responsibility for maintenance must be included in the project’s conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs). Printed educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on what storm water management facilities are present, signs that maintenance is needed, how the necessary maintenance can be performed, and assistance that the City may be able to provide. The transfer of this information shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property. If Structural or Treatment Control facilities are located within a public area proposed for transfer, they will be the responsibility of the developer until they are accepted for transfer by the public agency. Structural or Treatment Control facilities proposed for transfer must meet design standards adopted by the public entity for the facilities installed and shall be approved by the public agency prior to its installation.

i. Properly Design Structural and Treatment Control Facilities. Structural and treatment control facilities shall be designed based on either a volumetric or flow based treatment control design standard, or both, as described below to mitigate (infiltrate, filter or treat) storm water runoff:

1) Volumetric Treatment Control Design Standard:

a) The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event determined as the maximized capture storm water volume for the area, from the formula recommended in Urban Runoff Quality Management, WEF Manual of Practice No. 23/ASCE Manual of Practice No. 87, (1998); or

b) The volume of annual runoff based on unit basin storage water quality volume, to achieve 80 percent or more volume treatment by the method recommended in California Stormwater Best Management Practices Handbook – Industrial/Commercial, (2003); or

c) The volume of runoff produced from a historical-record based reference 24-hour rainfall criterion for “treatment” that achieves approximately the same reduction in pollutant loads achieved by the 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event.

2) Flow Based Treatment Control Design Standard:

a) The flow of runoff produced from a rain event equal to at least two times the 85th percentile hourly rainfall intensity for the area; or

1. Waiver.

At its discretion and for good cause, the City may waive one or more of the requirements set forth in this Section if impracticability for a specific property can be established. A waiver of impracticability shall be granted only when all other Structural or Treatment Control BMPs have been considered and rejected as infeasible. Recognized situations of impracticability include, (i) extreme limitations of space for treatment on a redevelopment project, (ii) unfavorable or unstable soil conditions at a site to attempt infiltration, and (iii) risk of ground water contamination because a known unconfined aquifer lies beneath the land surface or an existing or potential underground source of drinking water is less than 10 feet from the soil surface. A waiver may be revoked for cause and with proper notice.

4. Limitation on Use of Infiltration BMPs.

Three factors significantly influence the potential for storm water to contaminate ground water. They are (i) pollutant mobility, (ii) pollutant abundance in storm water, (iii) and soluble fraction of pollutant. The risk of contamination of groundwater may be reduced by pretreatment of storm water. In addition, the distance of the groundwater table from the infiltration BMP may also be a factor determining the risk of contamination. A water table distance separation of ten feet depth in California presumptively poses negligible risk for storm water not associated with industrial activity or high vehicular traffic.

Site specific conditions must be evaluated when determining the most appropriate BMP. Additionally, monitoring and maintenance must be provided to ensure groundwater is protected and the infiltration BMP is not rendered ineffective by overload. This is especially important for infiltration BMPs for areas of industrial activity or areas subject to high vehicular traffic [25,000 or greater average daily traffic (ADT) on main roadway or 15,000 or more ADT on any intersecting roadway]. In some cases pretreatment may be necessary.

5. Alternative Certification for Storm Water Treatment Mitigation.

In lieu of conducting a detailed BMP plan review to verify Structural or Treatment Control BMP adequacy, the City may, at its discretion, elect to accept a signed certification from a Civil Engineer or a Licensed Architect registered in the State of California, that the plan meets the criteria established herein. Certifying person(s) will have to demonstrate to the City’s satisfaction that they have been trained on BMP design for water quality not more than two years prior to the signature date. Training conducted by an organization with storm water BMP design expertise (e.g., a University, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Society of Landscape Architects, American Public Works Association, or the California Water Environment Association) may be considered qualifying.

The zoning and building data map is to be filed separately because the information on it is not required for a record of survey map. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.44.030 Standards and Criteria for Review.
The following conditions and standards and criteria for review shall be considered when evaluating all lot line adjustment applications:

A. Only legal lots may be subdivided or the subject of a lot line adjustment. No subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved which increases or creates a zoning nonconformity or is inconsistent with the policies of the certified Local Coastal Land Use Plan. All lots and sites created shall comply with minimum standards established for the zoning district which the property is located and with any other relevant requirements of the certified Local Coastal Implementation Plan.

B. No subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved which increases or creates a zoning violation or any other kind of illegality.

C. No lot line adjustment shall be approved that could lead to the creation of an additional building site unless a parcel map is prepared. For example, if the minimum lot size is 4,000 square feet and there are two adjoining lots, one of which is 7,000 square feet and another of 5,000 square feet, no lot line adjustment shall be allowed which would result in one lot of 8,000 square feet and one lot of 4,000 square feet because the newly created lot of 8,000 square feet could possibly be divided into two lots of 4,000 square feet.

D. Until there is sufficient water allocated in the City’s water management program to provide for development of all existing lots of record within the City no subdivision or lot line adjustment application shall be approved that would result in the creation an additional lot of record, parcel, or building site if such creation would increase the demand for water resources.

E. Approval of a subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be conditioned upon all zoning requirements being met on all lots involved in the subdivision or lot line adjustment. The Planning Commission may expect preexisting zoning nonconformities from this requirement if compliance is determined not to be in the public interest or contrary to the General Plan.

F. If, when curing a nonconformity or illegality that would be created by a lot line adjustment, one side of a building must be moved because it is too close to the proposed new line, another side of the building which is nonconforming shall not be required to be conformed unless the building is moved, demolished, or rebuilt.

G. Lot line adjustments increasing the average length of frontage on public streets for each lot involved in the lot line adjustment shall be encouraged.

H. Lot line adjustments tending to straighten lot lines shall be encouraged.

I. Lot line adjustments tending to cause lots to be more rectangular in shape shall be encouraged.

J. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, curing of existing nonconformities is deemed reasonable when considering the public health, safety and welfare as well as the financial cost, the cure of such nonconformities shall be required.

K. Other conditions may be required as the City deems reasonable and proper for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

L. Where a subdivision or lot line adjustment will result in or lead to the relocation of driveways or parking places on private property, the effect of such relocation on existing trees shall be taken into consideration and conditions reasonably related to the protection of existing trees and the location of driveways and parking places shall be established. No subdivision or lot line adjustment shall be approved that would require removal of a significant tree or create a building site that would not be viable without removing one or more significant trees.

M. All subdivisions and lot line adjustments approved shall comply with the minimum lot or parcel sizes established for the zoning district where the property is located.

N. Subdivisions and lot line adjustments resulting in the creation of additional building sites shall be approved only when consistent with the general pattern of lot sizes found in the immediate neighborhood (within 300 feet of the site) and when significant vegetation and other environmental resources on the site will be protected.

O. When determined to be consistent with the General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan, approval of subdivisions and lot line adjustments shall include easements for protection of natural resources and/or coastal resources, including but not limited to, scenic views, sensitive habitats, wetlands and coastal accessways. When establishing new lots and/or lot boundaries the decision-making body shall consider the physical constraints and biological constraints of the property and ensure that there will be sufficient buildable area to allow reasonable development on each lot affected after deducting areas limited by easements, slopes and other factors. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.44.040 Approval of Applications.
Applications for lot line adjustments or the filing of merger documents resulting in the consolidation or merger of existing lots of record, or consolidating or merging combinations of existing lots and lot fragments, to create larger whole lots of record in the R-1 district, may be approved by the Director of Community Planning and Building. All other applications for subdivisions and lot line adjustments shall require review for approval by the Planning Commission. Applications for subdivisions and lot line adjustments resulting in the creation of additional lots or record or additional parcels, including condominiums, shall require a coastal development permit. The City shall follow all applicable procedures in the Subdivision Map Act when processing any application for subdivision or lot line adjustment.

A. Certification Letter. The Planning Commission may request a report from the Director of Public Works and the City Forester before approving an adjustment. Upon approval of a lot line adjustment by the Planning Commission, the Director shall certify by letter the fact of approval. The certification letter shall be sent to the applicant. A copy of the certification letter and the final record of survey map or parcel map shall be sent by the Director to the County Surveyor or other appropriate County official.

B. Denial. If the request for the subdivision or lot line adjustment is denied, the Director shall send a denial letter to the applicant. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.44.050 Appeal.
Appeal from a decision of the Planning Commission shall be in accordance with Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

2. A ground, building, or tower-mounted antenna operated by a Federally licensed amateur radio operator as part of the Amateur Radio Service; provided, that its maximum height does not exceed the height requirements of the zoning district;

3. A ground- or building-mounted receive-only radio or television satellite dish, which does not exceed 18 inches in diameter, for the sole use of the resident occupying a residential parcel on which the satellite dish is located; provided, the height does not exceed the height of the ridgeline of the primary structure on said parcel and the dish is not visible from the street; and

4. Hand held devices such as cell phones, business-band mobile radios, walkie-talkies, cordless telephones, garage door openers and similar devices.

F. All power lines and wire-based communication lines to and from a wireless communications facility shall be undergrounded.

G. Providers of telecommunications services shall ensure that emergency communications services are available to the City on a priority basis in the event of a disaster or emergency. If telecommunications systems are rendered inoperable by a disaster, providers shall work with the City’s Emergency Operations Center to restore or provide substitute communications systems as quickly as possible. Telecommunications providers should not interfere with any City emergency service communications system. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.46.030 Field Strength.
Prior to the issuance of building permits, the approved telecommunications carrier shall submit an installation test plan for approval by the Department that describes the type of testing that will be performed in order to verify that operation of the facility will remain compliant with its licensing specifications and will not create adverse frequency impacts resulting in health hazards or interference with existing wireless facilities, network communications, computers, appliances, etc., in the vicinity. Upon activation, the approved telecommunications carrier shall submit the test results to the Department of Community Planning and Building. The City may require an approved carrier to conduct frequency testing at any time and report results to the City. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.46.040 Site Location.
A. Site location and development of wireless communications facilities shall preserve the visual character and aesthetic values of the community. Facilities shall be integrated to the maximum extent feasible into the existing characteristics of the site and surrounding area.

B. Co-location is encouraged when it will decrease visual impact.

C. Wireless communications facilities, to every extent possible, should not be sited to create visual clutter or negatively affect important public or private views as determined by the Planning Commission. Wireless communications facilities are discouraged in the public right-of-way.

D. Wireless communications facilities shall be screened from any public viewing areas to the maximum extent feasible.

E. Wireless communications facilities shall not be located in any required setback area of the zoning district in which it is located; all setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower or antenna structure closest to the applicable setback line. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.46.050 Design Review.
All wireless telecommunications systems shall be subject to design review approval by the Planning Commission. The following criteria shall be used in evaluating proposed installations:

A. Minimum Visibility. Opportunities for installations that preclude public view of antennas and support facilities shall be studied by the applicant as part of each application. The Planning Commission shall encourage installations that use:

1. Antennas and support equipment attached directly to existing buildings in an architectural manner that causes the equipment to be visually indistinguishable from the underlying architecture;

2. Antennas and/or equipment located behind parapet walls or on roof areas not visible to the public from adjacent areas;

3. Associated equipment (vaults, equipment rooms, utilities and equipment enclosures) that is located inside existing buildings or located underground.

B. Approved Color. All antennas, support facilities, ancillary buildings, towers, poles and other components of a wireless telecommunications installation that remain visible to the public shall be of a color approved by the Planning Commission. If the Commission determines that the facility requires paint, it shall be initially painted with a flat paint color sample that is authorized for trial use at the site by the Commission.

C. Screening or Camouflage. All ground-mounted equipment, antennas, poles or towers shall be screened or camouflaged by existing development, topography or vegetation to the extent feasible. Additional new vegetation or other screening may be required.

D. Required Materials. Towers and monopoles shall be constructed of metal or other nonflammable material, unless specifically conditioned by the Planning Commission to be otherwise. Antenna and support structures shall be maintained to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director.

E. Support Facilities. Support facilities (i.e., vaults, equipment rooms, utilities, and equipment enclosures) shall be constructed out of nonflammable, nonreflective materials. Support facilities that cannot be located within existing buildings or underground shall either be located out of public view or shall be enclosed in an architecturally compatible structure on private property.

F. Monitoring. The provider/operator of each wireless telecommunications system located within the City shall be responsible for maintaining the facility in a safe manner, complying with the field strength monitoring requirements in CMC 17.46.030, and complying with all applicable Federal, State, regional and local health and safety standards. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.46.060 Noncompliance with Health or Safety Standards.
Upon notification of violations of any standard, the provider/operator shall have 10 calendar days to correct the violation. Failure to comply within this limit shall be cause for the revocation of the use permit authorizing the facility and cause for requiring its immediate removal. The City Building Official, City Fire Marshal and County Environmental Health Officer shall each have independent authority to require an immediate cessation of facility operations at any time if continued operations pose a significant and immediate threat to public health or safety. Any facility found to be out of compliance with standards shall, upon correction of the condition, provide adequate funds to the City to allow for separate, independent verification of compliance by a licensed professional. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.46.070 Termination or Abandonment.
Wireless communications service providers and property owners of sites containing wireless facilities shall be responsible for removing unused or abandoned equipment within six months of termination of use or abandonment. The site of any wireless communication facility shall be restored to its natural state by the provider or property owner within six months of termination of use or abandonment of wireless communications facilities on the site. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.010 Purpose.
The City Council finds that in order to preserve windbreaks, reduce soil erosion, and preserve the natural beauty of the City’s urbanized forest, it is necessary to maintain the extent and health of the dominant Monterey Pine forest, along with other native tree species and adopts this chapter in the interest of public health and safety. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.020 Statement of Intent.
In establishing a forest management program and adopting these regulations, the City intends to foster a vibrant and healthy mixed-species, urbanized forest. Where tree removal is approved at the request of a property owner or occupant, another tree should be planted in a suitable location, whenever good forestry practice so dictates. It is further intended that City approval of requests for tree trimming or tree removal should be based on protecting public safety and preserving the health of the tree. The City does not trim or remove trees in order to improve the view of any person, including the applicant, except to preserve a significant public view identified in the General Plan/Land Use Plan. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.030 Exemptions.
The City is exempt from the provisions of Chapter 12 (commencing with Public Resources Code Section 25980), Division 15 of the Public Resources Code which chapter is known as the “Solar Shade Control Act.” The provisions of the Solar Shade Control Act also shall not apply to the cutting or trimming of trees or shrubs in the following circumstances:

A. When necessary for the construction of streets or buildings on public property;

B. When determined by the Chief of Police to be necessary for traffic safety; or

C. When ordered by the City Council. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.040 Emergencies.
The requirements of the chapter may be suspended, waived, or altered by the City Forester, in the case of a natural emergency such as a windstorm, earthquake, or flood. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.050 Required Permits.
A. Trees on Private Property.

1. Trees on Vacant Lots or Lots Planned for New Construction, Alterations, or Rebuilding. If remodeling, rebuilding or new construction is undertaken within six months from the cutting down of a tree, it shall be presumed that the tree was removed for remodeling or rebuilding. On a vacant lot or any lot on which any existing building is to be altered, rebuilt or demolished and replaced, a tree removal permit shall be required for the following trees.

a. Removal, replacement, cutting down, or destruction of any tree identified on the Carmel-by-the-Sea Recommended Tree List (see LUP Appendix G2: Forest Management Plan) having:

i. An average diameter of greater than two inches; or

ii. A circumference greater than six and one-fourth inches, measured at a point four and one-half feet above the ground level.

b. Any alteration of a tree that would remove:

i. Roots greater than two inches in diameter; or

ii. Live limbs greater than four inches in diameter.

2. Removal of Pine, Redwood, Oak, and Cypress Trees When Not Related to Construction. A tree removal permit shall be required for the removal, replacement, cutting down, or destruction of any pine, redwood, oak, or cypress tree having:

a. A diameter equal to or greater than four inches measured at a height 4.5 feet above the ground; or

b. A circumference greater than 19 inches.

3. Removal of Other Tree Species When Not Related to Construction. A tree removal permit shall be required for the removal, replacement, cutting down, or destruction of any species of tree capable of growing to a minimum of 25 feet in height growing on private property and having:

a. A diameter equal to or greater than 10 inches; or

b. A circumference greater than 32 inches.

B. Trees on Public Property. Any person desiring to remove or prune any portion of a tree or shrub, except Genista, growing in or upon any public street, way, park, or place within the City, or any person desiring to cut any wood, foliage, or roots from any tree on private property when more than one-half of the basal cross-sectional area of such tree is on City property, shall file an application for a permit consistent with CMC 17.48.060, Permit Applications. If, in the opinion of the City Forester, the tree or trees should be removed because of disease, infestation, or clear and present danger to persons or property, the trees shall be removed at City’s expense. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.060 Permit Applications.
Applications for tree removal permits shall be submitted to the City on forms provided by the City Forester. There shall be a fee for this permit as established by resolution of the City Council.

A. Review Procedures. Following submittal of a permit application, the City Forester shall:

1. Review all trees on the site and in the adjacent right-of-way. All trees shall be classified as significant, moderately significant or nonsignificant. All significant trees shall be documented by preparing a Significant Tree Evaluation Worksheet (see Appendix B3 to this title). The City Forester shall make a determination whether a significant tree is involved based on the evaluation in the worksheet.

2. The classification of all trees shall be provided to the applicant. The City Forester shall place any appealed application on an agenda of the Forest and Beach Commission, which shall act as provided for in Chapter 2.32 CMC.

3. The applicant may appeal a determination by filing a written notice of appeal within 10 days of the transmittal of the tree determinations. The City Forester shall give notice to the applicant of the time and date of the meeting at which the application on appeal shall be considered and of the final action by the Forest and Beach Commission.

4. Significant Trees. Applications to remove significant trees are subject to the findings in CMC 17.48.070.

5. Nonsignificant Trees.

a. Not Related to Construction. Approval of a permit to remove nonsignificant trees, not related to construction shall be determined by the City Forester. The City Forester’s determination may be appealed subject to the Forest and Beach Commission consistent with the procedures in subsection (A)(3) of this section.

b. Related to Construction. Approval of a permit to remove nonsignificant trees that are related to construction shall be determined by the Forest and Beach Commission, based on the Commission’s “Tree Removal Criteria” checklist.

B. Removal Without Posting. In exceptional circumstances in which it would cause substantial physical property damage loss or danger to delay removal until the Forest and Beach Commission’s next meeting, the City Forester may approve removal without the required posting, providing such approval unquestionably conforms to the policy and the practice of the Forest and Beach Commission. The Forester will report permit actions at the next meeting of the Forest and Beach Commission.

C. Required Reports. The City Forester will report her/his action at the next meeting of the Forest and Beach Commission.

D. Conditions of Approval. The City Forester or Forest and Beach Commission may condition a permit on replacement trees being planted at a place, of a species and of a size designated by the City Forester or Forest and Beach Commission. The person requesting the permit will be required to pay the cost of obtaining and planting the replacement trees.

E. Permit Limitations. Any permit granted under this chapter is nontransferable and shall expire one year from date of issuance. In the event a permit for tree removal is granted, in order to enable the applicant to carry out some project of development or improvement of her/his property, such permit shall be effective only in connection with the issuance of a valid building permit. (Ord. 2013-05 (Exh. A § D), 2013; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.070 Findings Required for Significant Trees.
A. Not Related to Construction. When not related to construction or development, removal of significant trees is prohibited unless authorized by the Forest and Beach Commission consistent with the following finding:

1. That the tree is causing substantial damage to a building that cannot readily be repaired or alleviated on a long-term basis, through minor reasonable building modifications.

B. Related to Construction. Removal of significant trees to facilitate construction or development is prohibited unless one of the two following findings is met:

1. That removal of the tree is required to protect public health or safety; or

2. That the following four conditions exist:

a. The existing site is vacant or is developed to an extent less than one-third of the base floor area allowed by the zoning applicable to the site; and

b. The available land area of the site not occupied by significant trees (including land within six feet of the trunk of significant trees) does not adequately and practically provide space for development of at least one-third of the base floor area allowed by the zoning for the site; and

c. The issuance of a variance for development in one or more setbacks has been considered and would not provide a remedy or would be inappropriate due to a significant overriding inconsistency with another policy or ordinance of the LCP; and

d. Failure to authorize removal of the tree(s) would deprive the owner of all reasonable economic use of the property. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.080 Tree Removal and Replacement.
A. Tree Replacement. When tree replacement is required by this chapter, the following requirements apply.

1. Location. Replacement trees shall be planted on site unless the City Forester recommends that replacement trees be located in the public right-of-way or in an adjacent park/open space area. All trees shall be planted within 30 days of tree removal or before final inspection if a construction permit. All trees will be identified with a tag provided by the City, which will remain attached to the tree until the required five-year inspection period has expired.

2. Tree Quantity. The number of replacement trees required when approving tree removals shall be based on the size of the lot, as listed in Table 17.48-A, the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood and protection of significant public views, scenic routes and corridors. In some areas fewer trees or only lower canopy trees may be most appropriate.

3. Tree Species. Replacement trees shall be the same species as the removed tree or another species listed on the Tree Species List and as approved by the City Forester except that particular emphasis shall be placed on maintaining a significant population of native Monterey pine, coast live oaks and Monterey cypress on a City-wide basis. Replacement Monterey pine trees shall be of local genetic stock.

4. Tree Quality. Replacement trees shall be of substantial size, caliper, and height to produce an immediate visual impact and reduce the incidence of unauthorized removal. Replacement trees shall be a minimum 24-inch box size except for Monterey pines, which shall be a minimum 15-gallon size. Larger sizes may be required by the Forest and Beach Commission, or the Planning Commission based in specific design considerations applicable to the project. The City Forester may authorize the use of smaller sizes when trees meeting these standards, or meeting specific conditions of approval, are unavailable.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance. Replacement trees shall be recorded and monitored for at least five years to ensure their establishment and growth to maturity. The City will inspect the replacement trees annually on or around each October, with proper notification, to ensure adequate maintenance. Replacement trees that do not survive or are removed shall be replaced at the owner’s expense. If, at any time during a five-year inspection period, the replacement tree(s) does not survive or is removed, the original replacement tree(s) shall be replaced with a new tree(s) that is equivalent in size to the measured or projected growth of the original replacement tree(s). The new replacement tree(s) shall be located in the same location(s) as the original replacement tree(s) unless granted permission by the City Forester or Forest and Beach Commission to change the location(s). The new replacement tree(s) shall be required to be replanted within 30 days of inspection, be identified by a tag and will restart a new five-year inspection period. (Ord. 2013-05 (Exh. A § E), 2013; Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.090 Prohibitions.
A. When not related to construction or development, removal of significant trees is prohibited unless authorized by the Forest and Beach Commission consistent with findings in CMC 17.48.070, Findings Required for Significant Trees.

B. Removal of any significant tree as determined by the City Forester using the adopted Significant Tree Evaluation Worksheet (see Appendix B4) to facilitate residential development is prohibited unless necessary to provide a viable economic use or protect public health and safety. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.100 Planting Trees.
All trees shall be installed according to acceptable nursery practices in a manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. Soil improvement measures may be required to ensure healthy growth. Before planting, a tree’s growth characteristics shall be considered to minimize conflicts with views, lighting, infrastructure, utilities, or signage.

A. Planting Specifications. Required trees may be securely guyed, braced, and/or staked at the time of planting until establishment. All plants shall be installed so that the top of the rootball remains even with or slightly above the soil grade. The top one-third of burlap shall be removed from the root ball at planting. If used, nylon strapping and wire cages shall be completely removed at installation. All guys and staking material shall be removed when the tree is stable and established. Construction debris shall be kept clear from the planting area. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.110 Protection of Trees During Construction.
For the purpose of safeguarding trees during construction, demolition or tree removal, the following conditions shall apply to all trees other than trees for which a removal permit has been issued:

A. Protection of Existing Trees.

1. Prior to the commencement of construction, demolition or tree removal, all trees on the building site shall be inventoried by the owner or contractor as to size, species and location on the lot, and the inventory shall be submitted on a topographical map to the Building Official. This condition may be waived by the Building Official for tree removal and minor demolition.

2. Damage to any tree during construction, demolition or tree removal shall be immediately reported by the person causing the damage, the responsible contractor or the owner to the City Forester, and the contractor and/or owner shall treat the tree for damage in the manner specified by the City Forester.

3. Oil, gasoline, chemicals and other construction materials shall not be stored within the dripline of any tree. All compaction of soils, construction of building walls, or placement of impermeable surfaces must be setback a minimum of six feet from all significant trees. Grading ruts and fills around significant trees shall be limited to areas outside the root projection zone identified by the City Forester in any preliminary site assessment (see Chapter 17.58 CMC, Design Review.) Drains shall be installed according to City specifications so as to avoid harm to trees due to excess watering or ponding. No wires, signs or other similar items shall be attached to trees. Cutting and filling around the base of trees shall be done only after consultation with the City Forester, and then only to the extent authorized by the City Forester. No paint thinner, paint, plaster or other liquid or solid excess or waste construction materials or wastewater shall be dumped on the ground or into any grate between the dripline and the base of the tree, or uphill from any tree where such substance might reach the roots through a leaching process.

4. The property owner/contractor shall erect protective barricades around all trees on a private building site. These barricades shall be in place prior to the start of any construction or demolition activities. Barricades shall be upright, two-inch by four-inch planks standing a minimum of eight feet vertically, conforming to the tree, tied with wire or rope forming a maximum of one-inch space between the planks. If the tree’s configuration or site conditions do not lend themselves to the installation of this type barricade, the City Forester will designate alternate tree protection methods. Under certain conditions where soil compaction is probable, fences may also be required around a tree or grouping of trees. The use of recycled lumber, synthetic lumber or similar materials approved by the City Forester for tree protection is encouraged.

5. Wherever cuts are made in the ground near the roots of trees, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent exposed soil from drying out and causing damage to tree roots.

6. Trimming cuts shall conform to arboricultural standards and shall be made along the branch bark ridge.

7. Prior to the start of any construction or demolition activities, the property owner/contractor is required to spray or have a certified applicator spray the lower six feet of all pine tree trunks with a pesticide approved by the California Department of Food and Agriculture for the treatment of bark beetles.

8. The property owner is responsible for care of all trees that are to remain on the site. This includes the treatment of bark beetles as designated by the City Forester.

9. Failure to protect or maintain trees on construction/demolition sites is a violation of the municipal code and grounds for suspension of the building permit.

B. Protection of Trees to Be Planted. Trees required to be kept on a building site and trees required to be planted as a condition of tree removal permit approval shall be maintained according to accepted arboricultural practices for a minimum of five years from the completion of construction or the date that the tree is planted.

1. At no time shall these trees be moved without the issuance of a valid permit.

2. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to replace or revoke any requirements for the safeguarding of trees found elsewhere in this municipal code or in the ordinances and procedures of the City. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.120 Tree Maintenance and Trimming.
A. Trees on Private Property. The property owner is responsible for the maintenance and trimming in accord with this chapter.

B. Trees Partially on Private Property. When more than one-half of the basal cross-sectional area of a tree is on private property and the remainder on City property, the City shall not prune wood, foliage, or roots except when:

1. In the opinion of the City Forester such cutting would not threaten the survival of the tree nor endanger public health and safety, nor endanger the health and safety of the property owner; and

2. Permission has been granted by the property owner concerned. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.48.130 Diseased Trees and Nuisances.
A. Trees on Private Property. Any trees, shrubs and other plants growing on private property, when infested by any insect or infected by any disease threatening the life of same, or which by reason of such infestation or infection endanger the life or growth or healthful existence of other trees, shrubs or other plants within the City not so infested or infected, or any trees determined by the City Forester to be a clear and present danger to persons or property, may be declared, by resolution of the City Council, to be a public nuisance and thereafter abated as provided for in this chapter.

B. Trees on Public Property. Any tree, shrub or other plant growing on City property, when infested by any insect or infected by any disease threatening the life of same, or which by reason of such infestation or infection endangers the life or growth or healthful existence of other trees, shrubs or other plants within the City not so infested or infected, or any trees determined by the City Forester to be a clear and present danger to persons or property, shall be removed as directed by the City Forester.

C. Nuisance Abatement. Following the City Forester declaration that a tree is diseased or a nuisance and shall be removed, the following is required.

1. Notice to Owner. Immediately upon determination by the City Forester that any tree, shrub or other plant is a nuisance, s/he shall cause a copy of this chapter to be sent by certified mail to the last address of record of the property owner concerned, together with a notice setting forth the details of the nuisance and the requirement of its abatement, advising the owner of the property that the nuisance shall be abated by the owner within 30 days if the City is not to proceed with the further steps set forth in this chapter.

2. Notice to City Council. In the event the nuisance is not abated by the property owner or her/his agent within the specified time, the City Forester shall forward to the City Clerk a request for resolution by the City Council, indicating that adequate notice has been given the property owner concerned and that the nuisance still exists.

3. Nuisance Hearing. The City Clerk shall place on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the City Council a resolution declaring diseased trees, shrubs or other plants to be a nuisance and setting a hearing thereon. The Clerk shall cause a copy of the resolution to be mailed to the property owner at least 10 days prior to such hearing.

a. Notice of Public Nuisance – Posting. After the passage of such resolution, the City Forester shall cause to be conspicuously posted on the property upon which such public nuisance is alleged to exist not less than three notices headed “Notice to Abate Public Nuisance,” such heading to be in letters not less than one inch in height and substantially in the following form. The notices shall be posted at least five days prior to the time for hearing objections to the abatement of such public nuisance.

4. Council Decision. At the time stated in such notices, the City Council shall hear and consider all objections, if any, to the proposed removal, and may continue the hearing from time to time. Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the City Council shall have acquired jurisdiction to proceed and perform the work or removal, and the decision of the City Council on the matter shall be final and conclusive.

WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM1
Sections:

17.50.010    Purpose.

17.50.020    Water Conservation.

17.50.030    Allocation of Water Resources.

17.50.040    Effects of Allocation.

17.50.010 Purpose.
The City recognizes a need to conserve and manage its water resources to achieve adopted land use planning objectives. The water resources of the City are presently derived from a water allocation system implemented by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a water management program that:

A. Reduces unnecessary water consumption in existing and new development;

B. Provides a process for dedication of the City’s limited water resources in new development;

C. Establishes a process for determining the broad land use categories to be served through allocations of existing and future water resources available to the City; and

D. Implements the General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.50.020 Water Conservation.
Water conservation is an integral part of the City’s water management program. Water resources available to the City are limited. In some cases, water conservation can increase the effective supply and allow development that otherwise would not be possible. Water conservation in new development can reduce the demand from each project and thereby increase the number of projects that can be served with available resources. It is the intent of this chapter to establish uniform standards for water conservation and to provide guidance on the manner in which conserved water is to be used within the City’s total water management program.

A. Uniform Standards for Plumbing Fixtures. The use of water-conserving plumbing fixtures shall be required for all new construction. All existing plumbing fixtures within any building that do not comply with the adopted standards for water conservation shall be replaced with complying fixtures upon issuance of any building permit authorizing substantial construction. Standards for water-conserving plumbing fixtures and the criteria for when such fixtures are required are established in Chapter 15.28 CMC.

B. Landscaping Standards. It is recognized that the irrigation of plants used in landscaping can consume large quantities of water. Proper design of irrigation systems and proper selection of plant species can significantly reduce water consumption while achieving a more natural appearance in community design through the use of native plants and other species habituated to the central coast. See landscaping standards contained in Chapter 17.34 CMC, Landscaping. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.50.030 Allocation of Water Resources.
A. Allocation. Following a public hearing, the City Council shall establish an allocation of water resources available for increased use by adopting an allocation resolution. The resolution shall define:

1. The remaining quantity of water available to the City including any new supplies made available since adoption of the last allocation resolution;

2. A list of defined land use or project categories for which water will be made available;

3. A discrete quantity of water, expressed in acre-feet per year, to be allotted for each defined land use category; and

4. A discrete quantity of water to be held as unallocated reserves.

B. Planning Commission Review and Monitoring. Before adoption of an allocation resolution, the City Council shall consider recommendations on the appropriate distribution of water to implement the General Plan and the Local Coastal Program as determined by the Planning Commission. Each allocation resolution shall reserve at least 10 percent of available water resources for projects that will create new affordable housing units for moderately low-, low- or very low-income households. Each allocation resolution also shall ensure that water is reserved for anticipated projects serving coastal recreation, access and essential public services. The allocation resolution shall remain in effect until replaced by a subsequent resolution containing the same information, and following the same process as outlined above. The Planning Commission should review water allocations for consistency with the General Plan and the Local Coastal Program on an annual basis and forward any recommendations for change to the City Council during the last month of each calendar year.

C. Unallocated Reserves. Water held in unallocated reserves shall not be used for any project or land use change until transferred to a defined allocation category. Such transfers shall be made by adopting a new allocation resolution as described in subsection (A) of this section. Reserves are intended to provide a means of adjusting water allocations to respond to changing conditions and General Plan policy. If new water resources become available to the City by action of the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, they shall be placed in unallocated reserves administratively until distributed to other categories through adoption of a new allocation resolution. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.50.040 Effects of Allocation.
The purpose and effect of establishing categories for the allocation of water supplies are to limit access to water to those categories that are consistent with the General Plan and the Local Coastal Program. No change in land use shall be allowed through any permit or license that could result in a net increase in water use unless such change has been approved in accordance with all applicable provisions of the water management program. In determining whether a project may result in a net increase in water use the rules and regulations of the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District shall be followed.

A. Acceptance of Applications. The Department of Community Planning and Building shall monitor the water allocations established by resolution of the City Council (CMC 17.50.030, Allocation of Water Resources). Each proposed change in land use or project for which an application is submitted shall be evaluated to determine whether its approval could result in a net increase in water use as defined by the Water Management District. Projects involving no net increase in water use or that will create new housing affordable to moderate, low- or very low-income households may be accepted and processed without regard to water allocations. For projects that may result in a net increase in water use, the following procedure shall be used by the Department:

1. The project shall first be classified into one or more land use categories based on the type of project. (For example, a mixed-use project would be classified into both the commercial and multifamily residential categories.)

2. An estimate shall then be made of the net increase in water use that would result from the project within each land use category.

3. If the project would require water from a land use category for which no allocation has been made, the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed.

4. If the project would require more water from a land use category than currently remains, after considering the original allocation minus all existing pre-commitments and dedications, the application shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be processed or shall be denied. An exception shall be allowed if the project would create housing affordable to moderate, low- or very low-income households. In such cases, the project shall be processed and then put on a waiting list until water resources become available.

5. If the project requires water and there is a sufficient supply remaining in the allocation for each category affected by the project to fully meet the anticipated demand, the application may be accepted for processing after meeting all requirements for a complete application established by the City.

6. Upon acceptance of an application as complete by the department, a pre-commitment of water resources shall be temporarily assigned to the project during processing of the application. The department shall keep a record of the remaining balance of water within each allocation category and a running total of all temporary pre-commitments and dedications to ensure that applications are not accepted for processing for which water would be unavailable upon approval. For projects that are denied or abandoned, the pre-commitment shall be terminated and the water shall be administratively restored to its original allocation category.

B. Approval of Applications. Once an application for a project requiring water resources has been approved, the Department shall permanently reduce the remaining balance within each allocation category affected by the project and shall issue a water release to the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District authorizing a debit to the City’s water allocation. This action shall terminate the temporary pre-commitment of water resources and create a permanent dedication of water resources to the project, subject to all applicable time limits established in the permit or by the municipal code.

C. Abandonment of Dedicated Water Resources. Upon making a determination that a water release has expired without use, or that time limits applicable to a project have expired without implementation, all water previously dedicated to a project, but not used, shall be considered abandoned. All water abandoned or not used by such unimplemented projects shall be returned to the allocation category from which it originated and shall become available for use by subsequent projects. For projects that are implemented and water demand was overestimated, any remaining, unused water shall be credited back to the City’s unallocated reserve. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

If, since the date of the original approval, the conditions surrounding the original approval have changed, or the General Plan, municipal code or Local Coastal Plan Program has been amended in any manner which causes the approval to be inconsistent with these plans or codes, no time extension or renewal shall be granted for any approval.

Any project or application denied and not subsequently approved by the City Council on appeal shall prohibit the implementation of the specific project or activity requested in the application.

17.56.010 Purpose.
These regulations are intended to preserve Carmel’s character as a residential village and perpetuate a balance of land uses that are compatible with local resources and the environment. These regulations will implement the General Plan and Coastal Land Use Plan and:

A. Maintain a mix of commercial uses that is compatible with Carmel’s residential village character;

B. Promote a broad range of goods and services that avoids the dominance of any single type of use and provides a variety of options to the City’s residents and visitors;

C. Encourage the development of second floor apartments above ground floor retail and service uses in the commercial district by limiting commercial uses that may generate noise, fumes, and litter;

D. Promote the establishment of unique, quality commercial uses that serve the intellectual, social, material, and day-to-day needs of the local community and visitors;

E. Protect and enhance the balanced mix of uses in the central business area, particularly along Ocean Avenue, to ensure a high quality, pedestrian-oriented commercial environment providing a variety of goods and services to local residents;

F. Reduce the generation of litter and food waste in the public right-of-way by limiting the number of establishments that sell food and beverages for immediate consumption by pedestrians;

G. Provide locations for retail goods and service establishments to serve surrounding neighborhoods;

H. Discourage the type of establishments that may displace businesses that supply residents with essential goods and services;

I. Prevent development which exceeds the amount and intensity of use that is compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods;

J. Limit the space occupied by businesses that generate high traffic and/or parking demands; and

K. Provide a transition and buffer between more intense commercial activities and less intense activities in the surrounding residential districts. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.56.020 Numerical and Size Limitations Established.

17.56.030 Procedure for Establishing a Restricted Commercial Use.
A. Acceptance of Applications. The Department of Community Planning and Building (the Department) shall maintain an inventory of commercial uses subject to the numerical limitations set forth in this chapter. Each proposed change in land use or project for which an application is submitted shall be evaluated to determine whether its approval would result in a net increase in the number of establishments or units that would exceed the limitations set forth in CMC 17.56.020. All applications to establish a land use subject to such limitation shall be returned to the applicant or denied if the approval of such use would exceed the limits specified in CMC 17.56.020. Applications that affect but would not result in a net increase in the number of establishments subject to limitation may be accepted and processed. Numerically limited uses approved by the City shall be physically established and in operation within six months of the date of approval. Failure to establish the use shall void the approval.

B. Reservation of Allocation. For approvals of numerically limited uses associated with construction activity (e.g., such as when a building addition or renovation has been approved for occupancy by the use) the six-month period for establishment shall be dated from issuance of a certificate of occupancy. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.56.040 Temporary Cessation of Restricted Commercial Uses.
A. Any property or business owner who has exercised the right to establish a commercial use subject to the numerical limitations set forth in CMC 17.56.020 and has continuously operated such use since its establishment may temporarily cease operations subject to the requirements of this section and all other applicable City regulations.

B. A numerically limited use may cease operation for a period up to six months without the use being considered abandoned. Periods longer than six months shall be authorized only for construction activity as established below or for a tenant search.

C. The property owner shall submit a written request to temporarily cease operation for any period longer than six months without the use being deemed abandoned. Temporary cessation of a numerically limited use shall be limited to a maximum period of 12 months in the case of a vacant space for which the property owner is seeking a tenant. The property owner shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Director that a tenant is actively and diligently being sought only for the specific use authorized. Failure to do so shall be cause for a determination of abandonment by the Director.

D. Permit Holder Responsibilities. During an approved cessation period the permit holder shall remain responsible for maintenance of the property in compliance with all applicable City codes.

E. Exceptions for Repair. Temporary cessation of a numerically limited use for any period of time exceeding six months in order to carry out repairs or improvements shall require a written request from the property owner and approval by the Director in order to carry out repairs or improvements.

F. No Abandonment Pressured. Temporary cessation of a restricted commercial use in compliance with the requirements of this section shall not be deemed abandonment of such use. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.56.050 Exercise and Abandonment of Restricted Commercial Uses.
A. Exercise of Permit. Unless otherwise specified as a condition of approval by the approving body, City authorization to establish a restricted commercial use shall be exercised within six months of the date of action by the City staff, Planning Commission, or final City Council action. If the application is subject to design review, the approval shall be exercised no later than six months from the date of completion of construction. Approval shall be deemed exercised when the use is physically established and in continuous operation.

B. Extension of Time to Exercise. The Director may grant one extension of a time limit for a period not to exceed six months. No time extension shall be granted for any approval if the General Plan, municipal code, or Local Coastal Plan Program has been amended so as to make the approval inconsistent with such plans or regulations.

C. Abandonment of Use. A restricted commercial use that has been discontinued for a period of six consecutive months shall be considered abandoned unless the property owner has filed notice of temporary cessation as provided for in this chapter. Failure to maintain a valid business license shall be considered substantial evidence of abandonment, and such use shall not be reestablished unless a new application is approved as required by this chapter. Establishment of any different use in a space authorized for occupancy by a numerically limited use shall be considered an abandonment of the numerically limited use. A determination of abandonment by the Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission, as provided for in CMC 17.56.040. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.56.060 Abandonment and Reestablishment of Motel Units.
A. The numerical limits on the total number of hotel/motel/inn units shall include all units located in the R-1, R-4, CC, SC and RC districts. If any units are abandoned through demolition or conversion to other uses, these abandoned units shall become available for reestablishment at another site consistent with the following findings and upon meeting all standards applicable to hotel/motel/inn uses as established by this title.

1. The proposed use will not create a net increase in the total number of lodging units beyond the numerical limits established in Table 17.56-A;

2. The proposed site where the units would be reestablished is not located in a single-family residential zoning district;

3. The use will be operated as a commercial business offering transient lodging for guests and visitors;

4. Upon completion, the proposed project shall include a minimum of five lodging units. No units shall contain kitchens or similar facilities for cooking food;

5. The project will provide parking for all uses on the site in compliance with the requirements of Chapter 17.38 CMC;

6. The proposed project complies with applicable commercial district regulations, including floor area, height, coverage, landscaping, signs, retaining walls and floodlighting;

7. Establishment of the lodging units will not require a debit from the City’s water allocation. The proposed project will operate within its existing water entitlement;

8. If the proposed project involves a transfer of water between sites, sufficient water will remain on each site involved to provide for reasonable development (e.g., one single-family dwelling on a residentially zoned site or retail/office uses on a commercially zoned site);

9. Requests for conversion or demolition of hotel/motel units shall be contingent upon a finding that the existing number of hotel/motel units available for transient occupancy has not significantly diminished from the established limit identified in Table 17.56-A: Limitations on Restricted Commercial Uses. Should the total number of hotel/motel units that have been converted, demolished or abandoned and are therefore available for reestablishment under the cap reach 50, any additional requests for conversion or demolition of hotel/motel units shall (1) be required to be offset one-for-one elsewhere in the City, and (2) shall be contingent upon a finding that the balance between visitor-serving, commercial, and residential land uses is maintained.

B. Remodeling, Reconstruction or Alteration of Motels in Single-Family Districts. The Planning Commission may approve a use permit to remodel, reconstruct, or alter a motel that was legally established in a single-family residential district based on a finding that the design of the proposed project and the design and bulk of proposed structures will be compatible with the residential character of the surrounding neighborhood and the following requirements:

1. The motel was lawfully established prior to January 1, 1967, and has been continuously operated since that date;

2. The total lot coverage of all buildings shall not exceed 35 percent of the total site area based on a survey prepared by a licensed professional surveyor and submitted with the application;

3. The total floor area will not exceed the floor area that was approved subject to the original use permit that was issued to allow establishment of the motel;

4. All proposed work will conform to existing setback and height requirements applicable to the R-1 land use district. All taxes levied upon the property or due the City from any owner or operator or prior owner or operator of the motel have been paid;

5. The proposed site includes at 1,500 square feet of lot area for each lodging unit in the motel;

6. The proposed construction shall not eliminate any existing on-site parking. If the proposed construction includes reconstruction of any units, one parking space shall be provided on-site for each reconstructed lodging unit;

7. The maximum number of lodging units per building shall not exceed 10 and the total number of lodging units within the motels shall not exceed the number permitted by the original use permit granted pursuant to this subsection or the number in existence on January 1, 1967, whichever is the lesser number;

8. If the project proposes reconstruction, the Planning Commission shall only grant design review approval based on findings that the site plan maximizes usable open space, minimizes unrelieved expanses of pavement devoted to parking and conforms in all respects to the commercial design requirements in Chapter 17.14 CMC, Commercial Zoning Districts;

9. All kitchens existing on motel sites on the date of the issuance of the use permit pursuant to this subsection shall be made to conform to all sanitation requirements and no additional kitchens may be permitted on the site. For the purposes of this section, kitchens shall mean any area for the preparation of food that meets the standards of the Uniform Building Code or the State Housing Code. No other facilities for the preparation of food shall be permitted other than kitchens;

10. Legally established incidental service uses that are being provided by the motel at the time the application is submitted but are not otherwise allowed within the land use district, will be limited to use by motel occupants only and will not be made available to the general public.

C. Any use permit approved pursuant to this chapter shall expire and no longer be valid if the construction authorized by the permit has not commenced within six months from the date of issuance, unless the Planning Commission approves an extension. (Note: These provisions (CMC 17.56.060(B)) approved by ballot measure and not amendable without a vote of the people; Code 1975 § 1341.3). (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.010 Purpose and Applicability.
A. Purpose. This chapter establishes objectives, standards, and procedures for conducting design review. The intent of these regulations is to promote and maintain the City’s special character as a residential village with a compact development pattern that respects and has been strongly influenced by the natural setting and is typified by a visually rich and creative mix of architectural styles. Design review is intended to encourage originality, flexibility, and diversity in design and preserve and enhance the community’s existing forest character while preventing unnecessary delays in project approval. More specifically, the design review process is intended to:

1. Promote design that maintains the City’s intimate and human scale and complements, rather than overrides, natural constraints;

2. Ensure that the design of new homes, residential additions, and exterior alterations preserves the traditional characteristics of scale, good site design, and sensitivity to neighboring properties;

3. Encourage the construction of residences that are diverse and innovative in design yet compatible with the City’s forest setting as well as the site design and materials used in surrounding structures;

4. Promote residential design that respects the privacy, solar, access, and private views of neighboring properties;

5. Maintain a tradition of architectural diversity that enhances the character of the commercial district and adds a lively sense of history to Carmel’s village ambiance by promoting commercial building design that respect these traditions; and

6. Encourage originality and invention so long as the results encompass the unifying values of human scale and the use of natural materials and their role in preserving village character and avoid out-of-scale or bizarre building forms or incompatible design.

B. Applicability. Design review is required for (1) specified physical improvements as established throughout this title, (2) new site development as defined in Chapter 17.70 CMC, and any substantial alterations, rebuilding, rehabilitation, new construction, exterior alterations, additions, signs, exterior lighting and landscaping associated with such construction, alterations or additions set forth in this title. (Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.020 General Requirements and Responsibilities.
A. Submittal Standards. The Department of Community Planning and Building (the Department) shall establish uniform submittal requirements to enable a full understanding of each project, facilitate review and provide consistency in information for decision-making. Applications for projects subject to design review shall include such information as may be required by the Director. Such information may include, but is not limited to, site plans, floor plans, building sections, exterior elevations, photographs of the subject or abutting properties, perspective or axonometric drawings and/or a model, description of building materials, material and/color samples, exterior lighting, fence plans, sign, drainage plans, landscaping and irrigation plans. Applications requiring design review shall be subject to a fee schedule as established by resolution of the City Council.

B. Coordination of Review Bodies. For any proposed major alteration affecting an historic resource in the commercial and R-4 districts, the Director shall schedule a review of the project plans by the Historic Resources Board for a determination of consistency with the Secretary of Interior’s standards. If the site assessment shows that trees will be affected by the project, the Director shall forward the plans to the City Forester for processing.

Any reviews by the Forest and Beach Commission and/or Historic Resources Board that are required for a project shall occur prior to consideration of the project by the Director or the Planning Commission. The procedures established in Chapter 17.32 CMC, Historic Preservation, shall be followed if the project would affect a historic resource or if it is unknown whether the property contains a historic resource.

C. Public Notice Requirements. For any project that requires preparation of preliminary site assessment pursuant to this section but does not require a public hearing and is not subject to the Coastal Zone notification, the Director shall post notice on the site and at City Hall at least 10 days before a decision.

D. Design Review Responsibilities. The Planning Commission shall conduct design review for all nonadministrative projects. The Director may require the Planning Commission to review for any application that raises new policy issues or presents unusual circumstances not addressed by adopted policies, guidelines, or review criteria.

E. Design Review Standards. When conducting design review the Department or the Planning Commission shall use the design guidelines adopted by the City Council as the basis for review. The decision-making entity responsible for design review shall consider the conformance of the application to the standards set forth in and promulgated under this title, and may either approve, deny or modify an application for design review. However, no modification may be made that is not consistent with any other requirement of this title. Specific zoning standards and criteria are established in each zoning district, overlay district, specific plan area, special district, or community plan area. These shall be coordinated with the guidelines in reviewing projects.

F. Prerequisite for Permit Issuance. Permits for projects and for signs that are subject to design review shall not be issued without design review approval pursuant to the requirements of this title. (Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.030 Commercial Design Review.
The City has established two tracks for design review of projects proposing new construction, alterations, rebuilds, additions, demolitions, and other exterior design changes in the central commercial (CC), service commercial (SC) and residential and limited commercial (RC) districts and the multifamily residential (R-4) district. Approval of any design review application for a commercial project under this section shall require the decision-making authority to find that the proposed project represents an improvement over existing conditions. All projects approved shall comply with minimum zoning standards established by this title. However, compliance with minimum standards does not constitute a sufficient basis for project approval. Projects also shall be evaluated for compliance with the design guidelines.

A. Commercial District Track One Design Review. The Director may approve track one applications for design changes in all commercial zoning districts and the R-4 district based on a determination that such projects comply with the Zoning Ordinance and all applicable commercial design guidelines and public way design guidelines.

1. Applicability. The following projects may be approved with commercial design review track one design review in the CC, SC, RC, and R-4 districts:

a. Public way improvements;

b. Storefront remodels/alterations;

c. Landscaping;

d. Exterior lighting;

e. Roofing materials and rooftop equipment;

f. Signs; and

g. Exterior flags.

2. Procedures. Within 30 days of the receipt of a complete application for a commercial administrative permit, the Director shall review the proposed project for compliance with the standards and regulations of the CMC, the Coastal Implementation Plan, General Plan policies, commercial design guidelines, public way improvement design guidelines, and other applicable adopted design criteria. The Director may approve the application if all zoning standards are met and the project is consistent with all design guidelines. The Director shall refer for action by the Planning Commission any application for a project that does not comply with applicable adopted design guidelines and design criteria. Any proposed storefront remodels/alteration to a structure located within the downtown conservation district shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation Board. The Director shall deny any application for a commercial track one permit that does not comply with the CMC, the Coastal Implementation Plan or the General Plan/Coastal Land Use Plan.

3. Limits. Track one review for projects involving historic structures or dwellings shall be limited to minor alterations pursuant to CMC 17.32.150.

B. Commercial District Track Two Design Review. This is a discretionary process for reviewing substantial design changes in commercial zoning districts and the R-4 district. The Planning Commission shall conduct design review under this section.

1. Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all commercial and multifamily residential projects that do not qualify for commercial district track one design review. This process also applies to all referrals from administrative commercial design review, all projects that require an initial study, negative declaration or EIR and to any project that requires a use permit, variance, subdivision or other land use permit including, but not limited to, the following:

a. Construction of new buildings;

b. Additions to existing buildings;

c. New parking facilities; and

d. Installation of antennas.

2. Procedures. Within 30 days of the receipt of a complete application proposing substantial design changes in any commercial zoning district or the R-4 district, the Director shall review the project for compliance with the standards and regulations of the CMC, General Plan policies, the Coastal Implementation Plan, and the commercial design guidelines. Applications subject to design review pursuant to this section shall not require a public hearing unless the project involves a historic structure or dwelling, requires a use permit, variance, subdivision, lot line adjustment, appealable coastal development permit, or other land use permit that requires a hearing in accord with the provisions of this title or State law. All track two projects shall be subject to the CDP requirements of the LCP and a track two design review approval shall constitute a coastal development permit for any project subject to review under this section. Projects involving historic resources shall require a determination of consistency pursuant to CMC 17.32.140. (Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.040 Residential Design Review.
The City has established two different residential design review tracks for projects in the single-family residential (R-1) district.

A. Residential District Track One Design Review. Track one is a staff-level discretionary review for projects that do not require a coastal development permit and are exempt from public hearing requirements. Staff shall review projects for compliance with all applicable zoning regulations and standards and for compliance with the residential design guidelines.

c. Public notice of the Director’s decision on a track one project shall be posted at City Hall and on-site for 10 calendar days. Any individual or entity aggrieved by the Director’s decision to approve or deny a track one residential district administrative permit may file a written appeal with the Planning Commission Secretary within 10 days of the date that the notice of decision is posted.

B. Residential Track Two Design Study. Track two is a discretionary review process for projects that require a public hearing with the Planning Commission. All track two projects shall require public notice and a hearing pursuant to CMC 17.52.110, Notice of Public Hearing.

1. Applicability. Residential district track two design review is for the construction of new dwellings, rebuilds, substantial alterations and other projects that comply with applicable zoning standards and design review guidelines but do not qualify for track one processing.

2. Procedures. Design review for track two projects is a three-phase process requiring: (1) preliminary site assessment, (2) design concept review, and (3) final details review. The application shall not be deemed complete until the preliminary site assessment has occurred and the City has received a complete application for design concept review. When a use permit, variance, or other land use permit is required, the application shall not be deemed complete until design concept review is completed and the City has received a complete application for final details review and for the applicable land use permit. The procedure for track two projects includes the following:

Step One: Preliminary Site Assessment.

a. Applicability. A preliminary site assessment shall be conducted prior to the submission of design concept plans for the following:

i. All new construction, demolition, and grading over 25 cubic yards;

ii. Residential additions that increase building coverage by more than 200 square feet or 10 percent; and

iii. Any project that will require grading within six feet of any tree classified by the City Forester as “significant” or “moderately significant”; and

iv. Any project involving tree removal or requiring significant cuts to the roots or limbs of any tree classified by the City Forester as “significant” or “moderately significant.”

b. Submittal Requirements. The applicant shall submit two copies of a topographic survey prepared by a licensed surveyor or a civil engineer prior to submittal of design plans for design review. The survey shall document property boundaries, topographic contours, the location of all trees over two inches DBH, the outline of all existing structures on the property, the location of any easements, existing access, the edge of pavement for all adjoining streets and all existing areas of site coverage. The survey shall be reviewed with the applicant and/or representative in the field by the City Forester and by the Director. Where topography, soil conditions, street configuration or other factors might require unusual drainage solutions, the City Forester or the Director may call in the Public Works Director for additional review and advice. In addition, the applicant shall deposit with the City an amount adequate to pay for a historic evaluation of any structure, dwelling, or property involved that is at least 50 years or greater in age and for which a determination of eligibility/ineligibility for the Carmel Inventory has not yet been made or is out of date.

c. City Forester Review. During the site visit the Forester shall review all trees on-site, in the adjacent right-of-way, and those which significantly overhang the site from adjacent properties. The Forester shall annotate the survey regarding the following:

i. The species, approximate drip line and state of health of each tree;

ii. Each tree shall be classified as to its significance to the urbanized forest based on its species, health and condition, size, form, character, age and location. Classifications used shall be significant, moderately significant and not significant; and

iii. For trees classified as significant or moderately significant the Forester also shall note important limbs that are low enough to encroach into potential building areas and areas where excavation or fill should be avoided to protect roots. Trees classified as significant shall be rated and documented using a standardized tree appraisal form.

d. Director Review. During the site visit, the City Planner shall annotate the survey regarding the following:

i. Design characteristics of the public right-of-way including landscaping, excess paving, and access opportunities or constraints;

ii. Design patterns and context of the immediate neighborhood including number of stories, exterior materials, setbacks, and open space/landscaping features;

iii. The potential for historic resources to be present on the site;

iv. Potential view and privacy issues on neighboring lots;

v. The potential for using setback exceptions, garden levels, basements, and other features of the Zoning Ordinance; and

vi. Unusual grade conditions or prior excavations that may require an approximation of natural grade in planning the building or calculating heights.

e. Survey Copies. Upon completion of both site visits and transfer of annotations to both copies of the survey, one copy shall be returned to the applicant for use in designing the project. The other copy will be retained by the City for use in reviewing the project. In preparing design concept plans the information on the preliminary site assessment map shall be used to avoid impacts on significant trees and minimize impacts on moderately significant trees. Design concepts shall respond to site constraints and opportunities in a manner consistent with the zoning standards, General Plan, and the adopted design guidelines.

f. Historic Resource Review. Planning staff or a qualified professional shall conduct an initial assessment of historic significance consistent with CMC 17.32.060(B). If there are no historic resources eligible for the Carmel Inventory located on the site, the procedures in CMC 17.32.060(D) shall be followed. If resources are found on the site that appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in the inventory of historic resources, an intensive survey of the property shall be conducted consistent with CMC 17.32.060(C).

Step Two: Design Concept Review.

a. Submittal Requirements. The applicant shall prepare design concept plans including “stick” drawings showing building placement, building form, heights, setbacks, access, approximate placement of windows, decks and balconies, proposed tree removals, rough grading, site coverage and floor area.

b. Planning Commission Review. Within 30 days of receiving a complete application, the Director shall schedule the project for a hearing and review of the design concept plans by the Planning Commission. Public notice shall be provided in compliance with the requirements of CMC 17.52.110, Notice of Public Hearing:

i. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed site design, basic massing, and other elements of the design concept for compliance with the City’s design concept guidelines and the findings required in CMC 17.64.080, Design Study Approval. At the conclusion of this review the PC shall either (1) accept the design concept as submitted, (2) provisionally accept the design concept and provide direction to the applicant on plan revisions necessary to achieve compliance with the design guidelines and/or zoning standards, or (3) continue design concept for preparation of a new design concept if it is substantially out of compliance with the zoning standards or the design guidelines. Applicants unwilling to make the revisions directed by the PC in a provisionally accepted concept design or continued design concept may request denial of the project so that an appeal may be filed. A denial shall not be complete until findings are adopted.

ii. Projects involving a historic resource shall require a determination of consistency pursuant to CMC 17.32.140. All project approvals shall be consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation except as provided in CMC 17.30.010. Following action by the Historic Preservation Board, the project shall be scheduled for design concept and final details review by the Planning Commission consistent with this chapter.

Step Three: Final Details Review.

a. Final Action. The Commission shall take final action on the application after the applicant submits the final design plans for review consistent with the City’s “Residential Design Guidelines: Final Details Review” and the findings required in CMC 17.64.080, Design Study Approval. For projects involving additions or alterations to historic resources or limited changes to nonhistoric structures, the Director may authorize concept review and final details review to occur at the same meeting.

3. Appeal. Any individual or entity aggrieved by the Commission’s decision to approve or deny a residential track two design study approval may file a written appeal pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 17.54 CMC, Appeals. (Amended during 8/09 update; Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.050 Conditions of Approval.

17.58.060 Findings Required.
A. Authority. The Director, Historic Preservation Board, or the Planning Commission as applicable to the project, shall have the authority to approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions, or deny an application for design review based on written findings stating the reasons for the action. Findings shall be based on information in the record.

B. Findings for Design Review Approval. Before approving an application for design review in any district, the Director, Historic Preservation Board, or the Planning Commission shall find that the final design plans:

1. Conform to the applicable policies of the General Plan and the Local Coastal Program;

2. Comply with all applicable provisions of this code; and

3. Are consistent with applicable adopted design review guidelines.

C. Additional Findings for Design Study Approval. In addition to any other findings required by this code (see CMC 17.64.080, Design Study Approval) the Planning Commission shall make all of the following findings before granting design review approval in the R-1 district:

1. The project conforms with all zoning standards applicable to the site, or has received appropriate use permits, variances or exceptions consistent with the Zoning Ordinance.

2. The project contributes to neighborhood character including the type of forest resources present, the character of the street, the response to local topography and the treatment of open space resources such as setbacks and landscaping.

3. The project is compatible with, and sensitive to, the natural features and built environment of the site and of the surrounding area. The project respects the constraints of the site and avoids excessive grading, cuts and fills. Construction on steep slopes is minimized to the extent feasible and abrupt changes in grade is minimized or mitigated.

4. The project maintains the City’s principles of modesty and simplicity and preserves the City’s tradition of simple homes set amidst a forest landscape. The project uses simple building forms and simple roof forms without complexity that would attract undue attention to the site.

5. The project does not present excess visual mass or bulk to public view or to adjoining properties. The project relates to a human scale in form, elements and in the detailing of doors, windows, roofs and walkways.

6. Project details and materials (e.g., windows, doors, chimneys, roofs, and stonework) are fully integrated and consistent throughout the design. Building materials are used in a manner that is visually consistent with the proposed architecture. All fenestration is appropriate in size and consistent with a human scale.

7. The project is consistent with the City’s design objectives for protection and enhancement of the urbanized forest and open space resources. Open space is distributed around buildings to provide visual relief from structural bulk and a distinct separation from buildings on adjacent sites.

8. All demolitions, remodels, and substantial alterations are consistent with the following findings:

a. The design uses simple/modest building forms and a limited number of roof planes, and a restrained employment of offsets and appendages consistent with the City’s design objectives.

b. The mass of the building relates to the context of other homes in the vicinity that are in conformance with the City’s design guidelines related to mass and scale.

c. The development is similar in size, scale, and form to buildings on the immediate block and neighborhood.

d. The development does not require removal of any significant trees unless necessary to provide a viable economic use of the property or protect public health and safety. All moderately significant trees have been protected to the maximum extent feasible. All buildings and structures will be set back a minimum of six feet from significant trees.

D. Findings Required for Approval of Deviations from Design Guidelines. In addition to any other findings required by this code, before approving any project in the single-family residential (R-1) district that deviates from the City’s applicable adopted design guidelines, the Director, Historic Preservation Board, or the Planning Commission shall adopt specific findings based on information in the record to show how the proposed deviation from the design guidelines achieves all of the applicable design objectives of CMC 17.58.010, Purpose and Applicability, as well as, or better than, would be achieved by adherence to the adopted design guidelines. (Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

17.58.070 Enforcement.
No building or grading permit shall be issued until the applicant submits a final site plan and building permit plans showing any changes required as a condition of design review approval. Staff shall review all building permit applications for projects subject to design review for compliance with approved design review plans and any conditions of approval. The Director may refer building permit plans to the Planning Commission for a determination of compliance with conditions of approval. After determining that the site plan and building plans comply with all conditions of approval, the Director shall forward copies of the approved plans to the Building Official. All future development shall comply with the approved building permit plans unless modifications or changes are approved pursuant to the requirements of this code.

Failure to comply with the conditions of approval may result in enforcement proceedings and penalties levied against the applicant and his/her assigns pursuant to Chapter 17.66 CMC. (Ord. 2009-07 Att. A, 2009; Ord. 2004-02 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2004-01 § 1, 2004).

Article I. Administrative Citation Appeals Process

18.04.010 Purpose.
City enforcement issues have become increasingly varied and complex. Alternative enforcement processes have been adopted by other public agencies as a means to address budget difficulties and resource shortages, and to streamline operations. Alternative enforcement processes minimize time delays that can result from increasingly crowded criminal and civil court dockets.

This chapter sets forth a variety of enforcement options to effectively and timely address code and ordinance enforcement matters in order to preserve and protect the quality of life in the neighborhoods and business communities of the City of Carmel-bythe-Sea. This chapter allows traditional criminal prosecution, civil action, and nuisance abatement as enforcement. This chapter further establishes several administrative enforcement procedures.

Administrative citations generally address municipal code and ordinance violations that the City, in its sole discretion, deems to be minor or transient in nature. The City adopts the administration citation enforcement process set forth in CMC 18.04.040 through 18.04.140, inclusive, which provides for de novo review of administrative citations in court if a person wishes to challenge an administrative decision upholding an administrative citation. For example, and not by exclusion, administrative citations may be used to enforce provisions regulating signs, yard waste, false alarms, noise issues, vehicle parking, minor, or nonrecurring violations of CMC Title 15, Buildings and Construction, CMC Title 17, Zoning, or similar matters.

For purposes of enforcement an officer issues an administrative citation that lists the violation and the administrative fine amount, and describes the procedures to be followed in order to pay the fine or, in the alternative, to request a hearing to contest the citation. The administrative citation may be contested through an administrative hearing process.

The fine must be deposited in advance of the administrative hearing. However, a procedure to waive the deposit is allowed for hardship. In the event the amount of the fine is not set forth in this code, the amount of the administrative citation fine shall be set by resolution. Penalties and interest shall be added for late payment of administrative fines.

The administrative citation process is set forth beginning with this section. (Ord. 2018-02, 2018).

18.04.030 Administrative Compliance Order Process Overview.
Administrative compliance orders generally address municipal code and ordinance violations that the City, in its sole discretion, deems not suitable for the administrative citation process contemplated by CMC 18.04.020. For example, and not by exclusion, administrative compliance orders may be used for serious, continuing, or recurring violations of CMC Title 15, Buildings and Construction, CMC Title 17, Zoning, or similar matters.

An administrative compliance order is issued to a responsible party by a City enforcement officer. The compliance order sets forth a description of the observed violation(s), a description of what the responsible party is required to do to bring the property into compliance, and the date by which compliance must be achieved. The compliance order provides notice as to administrative penalties that shall accrue if compliance with the order is not achieved by the date listed on the order. The administrative compliance order may be contested through an administrative hearing process. The decision may contain an order to correct any violations determined to exist, together with an order to pay administrative penalties and costs. The administrative compliance order process is set forth beginning at CMC 18.04.150. (Ord. 2018-02, 2018).
