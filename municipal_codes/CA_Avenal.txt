MUNICIPAL CODE

A Codification of the General Ordinances of
the City of Avenal, California

Adopted: May 27, 1982

Date of Publication: 2012
PREFACE
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Avenal,
California.
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering
system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing
provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section.
Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are
numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to
accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal
expansion.

In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the
provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table,
following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in
the codification; and beginning with the republication, legislation can be tracked using the "Code
Comparative Table and Disposition List."
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by
individual section numbers.
This republication brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2011-06, passed June 9,
2011.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE
This Code is organized to make the laws of the City as accessible as possible to City officials, City
employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important
elements of this Code.
Numbering System.
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses
a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It
is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is
represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04
of Title 2.
Title.
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code
contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain
ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are
separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use.
Chapter.
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the
chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters
which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without
renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04,
City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney.
Section.
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by
"tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering.
Tables of Contents.
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the
beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter
has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively.
Ordinance History Note.
AVENAL, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 3
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying
ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year.
(Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).)
Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These
history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the
back of the volume preceding the index.
Statutory References.
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are
applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated.
Cross-Reference Table.
When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older
or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the
Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled
"Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein."
As of the republication, this table will no longer be updated.
Ordinance List and Disposition Table.
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List
and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion
in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the
disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated.
(Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally
codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the
ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the
disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending),"
"(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)."
Beginning with the republication, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and
Disposition List."
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List.
Beginning with the republication, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for
use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of
each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies
the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of
each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any
section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
Index.
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is
an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and crossreferences
where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate
subheadings:
BUSINESS LICENSE
See also BUSINESS TAX
Fee 5.04.030
Required when 5.04.010
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended.
Looseleaf Supplements
AVENAL, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 4
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new
pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication.
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition,
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Kelly Heaton, Editor, and Eric Grant, Vice
President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other
members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Pamela J. Bonilla, City Clerk, and the other members of the citystaff
for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that
their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Municipal Code which will make the active law of
the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration
of the city's affairs.
Instruction Sheet.
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction
Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in
that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must
be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current.
Removed pages should be kept for future reference.
Page Numbers.
When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. When new pages
are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1,
32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be
left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use.
Electronic Submission.
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if
at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have
a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a

3-1.02 Revenue measure.
This chapter is enacted solely to raise revenue for municipal purposes, and is not intended for
regulation.
3-1.03 Effect on other ordinances.
Persons required to pay a license tax for transacting and carrying on any business under this chapter
shall not be relieved from the payment of any license tax for the privilege of doing such business required
under any other ordinance of the City, and shall remain subject to the regulatory provisions of other
ordinances.
3-1.04 License and tax payment required.
There are hereby imposed upon the businesses, trades, professions, callings and occupations
specified in this chapter license taxes in the amounts hereinafter prescribed. It shall be unlawful for any
person to transact and carry on any business, trade, profession, calling or occupation in the City without
first having procured a license from said City so to do and paying the tax hereinafter prescribed or without
complying with any and all applicable provisions of this chapter.
This section shall not be construed to require any person to obtain a license prior to doing business
within the City if such requirement conflicts with applicable statutes of the United States or of the State of
California. Persons not so required to obtain a license prior to doing business within the City nevertheless
shall be liable for payment of the tax imposed by this chapter.
3-1.05 Branch establishments.
A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or location of the business
transacted and carried on and for each separate type of business at the same location, and each license
shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on only the business licensed thereby at the location or
in the manner designated in such license; provided that warehouses and distributing plants used in
connection with and incidental to a business licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall not be
deemed to be separate places of business or branch establishment.
3-1.06 Evidence of doing business.
When any person shall by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone book, or newspapers, advertises,
holds out, or represents that he is in business in the City, or when any person holds an active license or
permit issued by a governmental agency indicating that he is in business in the City, and such person
fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the Collector that he is not conducting a business in the City,
after being requested to do so by the Collector, then these facts shall be considered prima facie evidence
that he is conducting a business in the City.
3-1.07 Constitutional apportionment.
None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue
burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the
Constitutions of the United States and of the State of California.
In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue
burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the
Collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made, before, at, or within six months
after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 4
testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business
and such other information as the Collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any,
of such undue burden or violation. The Collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first
obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount
that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund
of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the
Collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other
measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on
businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed
by this chapter.
Should the Collector determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, he
may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the City, or
at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of
license tax thereof, provided that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required
after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter.
3-1.08 Exemptions.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying
on any business exempt by virtue of the constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the
State of California nor shall it be construed to require the payment of a license fee to conduct, manage or
carry on any business, occupation or activity from any institution or organization which is conducted,
managed or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable purposes or from which profit is not derived,
either directly or indirectly, by any individual, firm or corporation.
Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section, shall file a sworn statement with the
Collector stating the facts upon which exemption is claimed, providing the Collector with the Federal and
State identification number for exempt organization, and in the absence of such statements substantiating
the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by this chapter.
The Collector shall, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement, issue a license to such
person claiming exemption under this section without payment to the City of the license tax required by
this chapter.
The Collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to a licensee, may revoke
any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this section upon the information that the licensee is not
entitled to the exemptions as provided herein.
3-1.09 Contents of license.
Every person required to have a license under the provisions of this chapter shall make application
as hereinafter prescribed for the same to the Collector of the City, and upon the payment of the
prescribed license tax the Collector shall issue to such person a license which shall contain the following
information: (1) The name of the person to whom the license is issued; (2) The business licensed; (3) The
place where such business is to be transacted and carried on; (4) The date of the expiration of such
license; and (5) Such other information as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter.
Whenever the tax imposed under the provisions of this chapter is measured by the number of
vehicles, devises, machines, or other pieces of equipment used by the licensee, the Collector shall issue
only one license; provided that he may issue for each tax period for which the license tax has been paid
one identification sticker, tag, plate, or symbol for each item included in the measure of the tax.

ascertaining the amount of the license tax to be paid by the applicant, a sworn statement, upon a form to
be provided by the Collector, setting forth such information concerning the applicant's business during the
preceding year as may be required by the Collector to enable him to ascertain the amount of the license
tax to be paid by said applicant pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
No statements shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth herein nor shall the filing of the same
preclude the City from collecting by appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable
hereunder.
3-1.12 Information confidential.
It shall be unlawful for the Collector or any person having an administrative duty under the provisions
of this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information

any provisions of this chapter, or collecting taxes imposed hereunder; (2) The disclosure of information to,

3-1.13 Failure to file.
If any person fails to file any required statement within the time prescribed, or if after demand
therefor made by the Collector he fails to file a corrected statement, or if any person subject to the tax
imposed by this chapter fails to apply for a license, the Collector may determine the amount of license tax
due from such person by means of such information as he may be able to obtain.
If the Collector is not satisfied with the information supplied in statements or applications filed, he

serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States Post Office at Avenal, California, postage
prepaid, addressed to the person so assessed at his last known address. Such person may, within fifteen

to be set for hearing within fifteen (15) days before the City Council. The Collector shall give at least ten

3-1.16 License nontransferableChanged location and ownership.

the transacting and carrying on of such business under said license at some other location to which the

and Use Tax Law of the State insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the
requirements and limitations set forth in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code of the State;

can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adopts
itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in
administering and collecting the sales and use taxes of the State; and
(d) To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree
possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code of the State, minimize the cost of collecting City sales and use taxes and at the same time
minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of
this chapter.
3-5.05 Contract with State Board of Equalization.
Prior to the operative date of this chapter, the City shall contract with the State Board of Equalization
to perform all the functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax law. If the
City shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to such operative date, the City
shall nevertheless so contract, and, in such a case, the operative date shall be the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the execution of such contract rather than the first day of the first calendar
quarter following the adoption of this chapter.
3-5.06 Sales taxes imposed.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all
retailers in the City at the rate set forth in Section 3-5.02 of this chapter of the gross receipts of the retailer
from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in the City on and after the operative date of
this chapter.
3-5.07 Sales taxesPlace of sale defined.
For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the
retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-
State destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-State destination. The gross receipts
from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the State sales and use
tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of
business in the State or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales
are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the
State Board of Equalization.

forth in this chapter.
3-5.10 Adoption of State law provisionsLimitations.
In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State,
wherever the State is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of the City shall be substituted
therefor. Such substitution, however, shall not be made when the word "State" is used as part of the title
of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization,
the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State. Such substitution shall not be made when the result of
that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the City, or any agency thereof, rather than
by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or
operation of the provisions of this chapter. Such substitution shall not be made in those sections,
including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the State, where
the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales,
storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt
from this tax while such sales, storage, use, or other consumption remains subject to tax by the State
under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of said Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain
sales, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax
by the State under the said provisions of said Code. Such substitution shall not be made in Sections6701,
6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797, or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation

3-6.02 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter unless otherwise apparent from the context, certain words and
phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows:
(a) "Hotel" shall mean any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended
or designed for occupancy, by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes and shall
include any hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private
club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure, or portion
thereof.
(b) "Occupancy" shall mean the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any
room, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.
(c) "Operator" shall mean the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of
owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the
operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than
an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
(d) "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club,
fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver,
trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.
(e) "Rent" shall mean the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of
space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise,
including all receipts, cash, credits, property, and services of any kind or nature, without any
deduction therefrom whatsoever.
(f) "Tax Administrator" shall mean the City Clerk.
(g) "Transient" shall mean any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy in a
hotel by reason of a lease, concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a
period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full
days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the
period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the
operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a
person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the
effective date of the provisions of this chapter may be considered.
(h) "Transient Occupancy Tax Review Committee" shall mean the Council.
3-6.03 ImposedRate.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient shall be subject to and shall pay a tax in
the amount of six (6) percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed
by the transient to the City, which debt shall be extinguished only by payment to the operator of the hotel
or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid
in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall
be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid
to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the
Tax Administrator.
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 21
3-6.04 Enforcement.
The Tax Administrator shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall have the power to adopt
rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter as may be necessary or
desirable to aid in such enforcement. He shall provide schedules for the payment of the tax, and such
schedules shall eliminate fractions of one cent ($0.01).
3-6.05 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon:
(a) Any person as to whom or any occupancy as to which it is beyond the power of the City to
impose the tax provided for in this chapter;
(b) Any officer or employee of a foreign government, which officer or employee is exempt by reason
of express provisions of Federal laws or international treaties;
(c) Any occupant for more than thirty (30) successive calendar days;
(d) Any occupant whose rent is of a value less than two dollars ($2.00) per day;
(e) Any person who rents a private home, vacation cabin, or like facility from an owner who is not
regularly engaged in the business of renting such facilities but does so only occasionally and
incidentally to his own use thereof; and
(f) Any occupant whose rent is paid for a hospital room or to a medical clinic, convalescent home,
or home for aged people.
No exemption shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this section,
except upon a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a
form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
3-6.06 Duties of operators.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter to the same extent and
at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately
stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from
the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax, or any part thereof, will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added
to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.
Every operator maintaining a place of business or renting rooms in the City, the occupancy of which
is not exempted under the provisions of this chapter, shall collect the tax from the occupant. The tax
required to be collected by the operator shall constitute a debt owed by the operator to the City. In all
cases of transactions upon credit or deferred payment, the payment of the tax to the operator may be
deferred in accordance therewith, and the operator shall be liable therefor at the time and to the extent
such credits are paid or deferred payments are made in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the
amount thereof.
3-6.07 Registration.
(a) Required. Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a hotel in the
City shall register with the Tax Administrator on a form provided by the Tax Administrator. Persons
engaged in such business shall so register not later than fifteen (15) days after commencing
business, but such registration after commencing business shall not relieve any person from the
obligation of the payment or the collection of the tax on and after the date of commencing business.
(b) Form. Such registration shall set forth the following information:
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 22
(1) The name under which such person transacts or intends to transact business.
(2) The location of his place or places of business; and
(3) Such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the Tax Administrator mayrequire.
The registration shall be signed by the owner if a natural person; in case of an association or
partnership, by a member or partner; in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or
some other person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the registration.
(c) Certificates. The Tax Administrator shall, within ten (10) days after such registration, issue, without
charge, a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with
a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business of such registrant. Such certificate shall,
among other things, set forth the following information:
(1) The name of the operator;
(2) The address of the hotel;
(3) The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
(4) A statement as follows: "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient
Occupancy Tax Law of the City by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of
collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting such tax to the Tax
Administrator. This certificate shall not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business
or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly
complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit
from any board, commission, department, or office of this City. This certificate shall not
constitute a permit."
Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately
to the Tax Administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer.
Each certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which such certificate is applicable and
shall be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants
and persons seeking occupancy.
3-6.08 Penalties and interest.
(a) Original delinquencies. Any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by the provisions of this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the tax in addition to the
amount of the tax.
(b) Continued delinquencies. Any operator who shall fail to remit any delinquent remittance on or before
a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall
pay a second delinquency penalty in the amount of ten (10) percent of the tax in addition to the
amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed.
(c) Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the non payment of any remittance due pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this chapter, a
penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed any operator who shall fail to remit any tax imposed by
the provisions of this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction
thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
(e) Penalties and interest merged with tax. Every penalty imposed, and such interest as accrues,
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by the
provisions of this chapter.

Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 23
3-6.09 Due datesReturnsPayments.
(a) Due dates. The tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall become due and payable from the
occupant at the time of occupancy. All amounts of such taxes collectible or collected by any operator
shall be due and payable to the Tax Administrator quarterly on the first day of the months of April,
July, October, and January next succeeding each respective quarterly period and shall be delinquent
after the last day of such months.
(b) Returns: Filing. On or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period of three (3)
months, a return for the preceding quarterly period shall be filed with the Tax Administrator. The
return shall be filed, in such form as the Tax Administrator may prescribe, by every operator and
every person liable to the payment of the tax during such quarterly period who has not paid such tax
and who has not made a return in regard to the related occupancy which is the subject of tax.
(c) Returns: Form. The returns shall show the amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related
period and such other information as is required by the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
may require the returns to show the total rentals upon which the tax was collected or otherwise due,
the gross receipts of a registered returnee for such period, and an explanation in detail of any
discrepancy between such amounts.
(d) Returns: Delivery. The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the
remittance of the amount of the tax due, to the Tax Administrator at his office.
(e) Extensions of time. For good cause the Tax Administrator may extend for not to exceed one month
the time for making any return of payment of the tax. No further extension shall be granted, except
by the Transient Occupancy Tax Review Committee. Any person to whom an extension is granted,
who makes a return and pays the tax within the period of such extension, shall pay, in addition to the
tax, interest on the amount thereof at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the
unpaid balance for the period of such extension to the time of the return and payment, which interest
shall become a part of the tax.
(f) Other than quarterly periods. The Tax Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure
payment or facilitate collection by the City of the amount of taxes in any individual case, may require
the returns and the payment of the amount of the taxes for other than quarterly periods.
3-6.10 Deficiency determinations.
(a) If the Tax Administrator is not satisfied with the returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to
be paid to the City by any person, the Tax Administrator may compute and determine the amount
required to be paid upon the basis of the facts contained in the returns or upon the basis of any
information within the possession of the Tax Administrator or that may come into his possession.
One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more than one
period.
(b) In making a determination the Tax Administrator may off set overpayments, if any, which may have
been previously made for a period or periods, together with interest on the overpayments, against
any underpayment for a subsequent period or periods, or against penalties and interest on the
underpayments. The interest on underpayments and overpayments shall be computed in the manner
set forth in Section 3-6.08 of this chapter.
(c) The Tax Administrator shall give to the operator or occupant written notice of his determination. The
notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, the notice shall be enclosed in a sealed
envelope, postage prepaid, and be addressed to the operator at his address as it appears in the
records of the Tax Administrator. In cases of service by mail or any notice required by the provisions
of this chapter, the service shall be complete at the time of deposit in the United States Post Office.
(d) Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade the provisions of this chapter or authorized rules and
regulations, or failure to make a timely return, every deficiency determination shall be made and
notice thereof mailed within three (3) years after the last day of the month following the close of the
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 24
quarterly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three (3) years after
the return is filed, whichever period expires the later.
(e) If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax or to make, within the time provided in this
chapter, any report and remittance of such tax, or any portion thereof, required by the provisions of
this chapter, or makes a fraudulent return or otherwise wilfully attempts to evade the provisions of
this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain the
facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator
shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment
of any such tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and payable by any operator who has
failed or refused to collect the tax and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Administrator
shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties
provided for by this chapter. In the event such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall
give notice of the amount so assessed. Such determination and notice shall be made and mailed
within three (3) years after discovery by the Tax Administrator of any fraud, intent to evade, or failure
to file a return. Any determination shall become final within thirty (30) days after giving notice thereof
as provided in this subsection.
(f) If the Tax Administrator believes that the collection of any tax or any amount of tax required to be
collected and paid to the City will be jeopardized by delay, or if any determination will be jeopardized
by delay, he shall thereupon make a determination of the tax or amount of the tax required to be
collected, noting that fact upon the determination. The amount determined shall be immediately due
and payable. If the amount specified in the determination is not paid within ten (10) days after the
service of the notice thereof upon the person against who the determination is made, the amount
shall become final at the expiration of such ten (10) days, and the delinquency penalty and the
interest provided for in Section 3-6.08 of this chapter shall attach to the amount of the tax or the
amount of the tax required to be collected.
3-6.11 Redeterminations.
(a) Any person against who a determination is made pursuant to the provisions of Section 3-6.10 of this
chapter, or any person directly interested, may petition for a redetermination within fifteen (15) days
after the service upon the person of the notice thereof. If a petition for redetermination is not filed
within the thirty (30) day period, the determination shall become final at the expiration of the period;
provided, however, a petition for redetermination pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of
Section 3-6.10 of this chapter shall be filed within ten (10) days after notice.
(b) If a petition for redetermination is filed within the allowable time, the Tax Administrator shall
reconsider the determination and, if the person has so requested in his petition, shall grant the
person an oral hearing and shall give him ten (10) days notice of the time and place of the hearing.
The Tax Administrator may continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary.
(c) The Tax Administrator may decrease or increase the amount of the determination before it becomes
final, but the amount may be increased only if a claim for the increase is asserted by the Tax
Administrator at or before the hearing.
(d) The order or decision of the Tax Administrator upon a petition for redetermination shall become final
fifteen (15) days after the service upon the petitioner of the notice thereof, unless an appeal of such
order or decision is filed with the Transient Occupancy Tax Review Committee within fifteen (15)
days after the service of such notice.
(e) No petition for redetermination or an appeal therefrom shall be effective for any purpose unless at or
before the filing thereof the amount due in the original determination is paid or a bond or other
security satisfactory to the Tax Administrator is filed with him guaranteeing the payment of any
amount finally determined to be due.
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 25
3-6.12 Collection security.
(a) The Tax Administrator, whenever he deems it necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of
this chapter, may require any person subject to the provisions of this chapter to deposit with him
such security in the form of cash, a bond, or other security as the Tax Administrator may determine.
The amount of the security shall be fixed by the Tax Administrator but shall not be greater than twice
the person's estimated average liability for the period for which he files returns, determined in such
manner as the Tax Administrator deems proper, or ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), whichever
amount is the lesser. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the Tax
Administrator, subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter.
(b) If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid by him, or in the event a
determination has been made against him which remains unpaid, the Tax Administrator may, not
later than three (3) years after the payment became delinquent, give notice thereof by registered mail
to all persons in the County having in their possession or under their control any credits or other
personal property belonging to the delinquent or owning any debts to the delinquent. After receiving
such notice, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the
credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they
receive the notice until the Tax Administrator consents to a transfer or disposition or until twenty (20)
days elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall, within five (5) days after the
receipt of the notice, advise the Tax Administrator of all such credits, other personal property, or
debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by them.
(c) At any time within three (3) years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected
becomes due and payable, or at any time within three (3) years after any determination becomes
final, the Tax Administrator may bring an action in the courts of the State, or any other state, or of the
United States, in the name of the City to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and
interest.
(d) If any operator liable for any amount pursuant to the provisions of this chapter sells his business or
quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover
such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that he
has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the purchaser of a business fails to
withhold the tax from the purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the
payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in
money. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate,
the Tax Administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail a notice to the purchaser at his address
as it appears on the records of the Tax Administrator of the amount that shall be paid as a condition
of issuing the certificate. Failure of the Tax Administrator to mail the notice will release the purchaser
from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as provided in this subsection.
The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the
operator sells his business or at the time the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever
event occurs the later.
3-6.13 Refunds.
Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been overpaid, paid more than once, or
has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, such amount may be refunded provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the
specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years
after the date of payment. The claim is approved by the Tax Administrator, the excess amount collected
or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from
whom such amount was collected or by whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person, his
administrators, or executors.

come into being.
(c) Examinations of records: Investigations. The Tax Administrator, or any person authorized in writing
by him, may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any person liable for the tax and

return made or, if no return is made by the person, to ascertain and determine the amount required
to be paid.
(d) Authority to require reports: Contents. In the administration of the tax, the Tax Administrator may
require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in his or their possession or
custody information relating to rentals of guest rooms which are subject to the tax. The reports shall

tax, or amounts of tax required to be collected, interest, and penalties, provided, however, the

claim asserted against him by the City for business taxes, or when acting upon any othermatter;
and
(7) The disclosure of general statistics regarding taxes collected or business done in the city.
Neither the Tax Administrator nor any person having an administrative duty pursuant to the

This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Development Impact Fee Ordinance of the
City of Avenal, California.
(Ord. No. 2006-02, 7-13-2006)
3-11.02 Findings.
The City Council of the City of Avenal hereby finds and declares as follows:
(a) The State of California, through the enactment of Government Code Sections 66001 through
66009 has, among other things, determined the nexus that must be established in the
enactment of development impact fees.
(b) The imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that
development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public facilities and service
improvements necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done in order to
promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare.
(c) This chapter recognizes that all new development within the City will result in additional growth
and that such growth will place additional burdens on various City facilities, infrastructure and
services. This chapter further recognizes the types of land development that will generate
Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 50
impacts necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and expansion
of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them.
(d) All land uses within the City should bear a proportionate financial burden in the construction and
improvement of public facilities and services necessary to serve them.
(e) The cost of providing public facilities and service improvements occasioned by development
projects within the City of Avenal exceeds the revenue generated by fees exacted from the
development projects.
(f) The development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs which are
generated through the need for new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required,
incremental, by new development within the City of Avenal.
(g) The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public
facilities occasioned by development projects within the City of Avenal.
(h) The fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the reasonable cost of providing public
facilities occasioned by development projects within the City of Avenal, which public facilities
are consistent with the General Plan and the various Elements of the General Plan of the City of
Avenal.
(i) The public facilities and anticipated future development herein referenced are based upon an
analysis of existing land use and zoning.
(j) The fees established by this chapter are consistent with the goals and objectives of the City's
General Plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts caused by new development throughout
the City. Development impact fees are necessary in order to finance the required public facilities
and service improvements and to pay for new development's fair share of their construction
costs.
(k) Imposition of fees to finance public facilities and service improvements is necessary in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare.

(1) A determination is made that such action will promote and stimulate economic
development within the City. The City Council shall make specific findings setting forth how
the subject project accomplishes this goal.
(2) Establish a specific timetable for payment in full of the deferred fees. The Council may also
require a percentage to be paid with the issuance of a building permit. In no event shall
deferral of payment in full be permitted for more than five (5) years.
(3) Interest on the unpaid portion of deferred impact fees shall accrue at a rate equal to the
Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) interest rate in effect at the time the resolution is
adopted and shall be articulated in said resolution. Interest shall be due and payable, infull,

developing the project.
(4) A written guarantee of payment in full of said impact fees, in the form of a surety bond or
some other form of surety instrument as may be acceptable to the City Engineer and the
City Attorney, shall be executed and delivered to the City prior to the issuance of a building
permit for the project. Interest in real property may be deemed an appropriate form of
surety.
(5) A determination is made that such deferral of the fees shall not materially affect the
financial ability of the City to satisfy its then current five (5) year capital improvement
program.
(c) Development impact fees shall be paid at the time of application for a building permit.
(d) The fees created pursuant to this chapter shall be calculated on the basis of gross acreage, or

development projects containing a fraction of a net acre, the fee shall be calculated on the
fraction of the acre involved in the development project. All fees collected shall be promptly
deposited in the appropriate fund referenced in Section 3-11.08 of this chapter. All fees paid
pursuant to this chapter shall be the fees in effect at the time of collection; provided that fees
collected pursuant to subsection (b) hereinabove shall be those in effect at the time the Council
adopts the required resolution.

3-11.11 Fee adjustments.
(a) A developer of any project subject to the fees described herein may apply to the City Council for a
reduction, adjustment, or waiver of any one or more of the fees, based upon the absence of any
reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of
the fee(s) charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and
filed with the City Clerk not later than: 1) ten (10) days prior to the public hearing on the development
permit application for the project; or 2) if no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of
the request for a building permit.

Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 55
(c) The City Council shall consider the application at the public hearing on the permit application or at a
separate public hearing held within sixty (60) days after the filing of the fee adjustment application,
whichever is later. The hearing shall be noticed and conducted in the same fashion and manner as
prescribed by the laws of the City for hearing on development permits. The decision of the City
Council shall be final.
(d) If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use within the project shall invalidate
the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee if such change in use would render the same
inappropriate.
(e) The City Council may, from time to time, and as the need may arise, set forth, by Council resolution,
specific limitations which will apply to reductions, adjustments or waivers of development impact fees
which may be made pursuant to this section. In this regard, this chapter shall be considered enabling

have constructed public facilities described in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3-11.05 of
this chapter, where those facilities were beyond that needed to mitigate the impact of the developer's
project or projects.
(b) In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of public

service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the
type to which the fees involved relate.
(c) At least once each fiscal period, the City Manager of the City of Avenal (herein "City Manager"), or
his/her duly authorized designee, shall present to the City Council a proposed five (5) year capital
improvement program for the various public facilities referenced in the resolution adopted pursuant

Title 3 FINANCE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 56
calendar days of the expiration of the permit. Failure to timely submit the required application for
refund shall constitute a waiver of any right to the refund.

fund established pursuant to Section 3-11.08 five (5) or more years after deposit of the fee, the City

demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged.
(c) The unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which

improvements that relate to the fees, as demonstrated by the applicant and reviewed and approved
by the City Engineer, all consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) above. Subject to
the applicable provisions of subsection (b) of this section, if the cost of the facilities or improvements

the applicant the excess amount.
(4) An amount of in-lieu credit that is greater than the specific fee(s) required under this chapter may be
reserved and credited toward the fee of any subsequent phases of the same development, if

improvements or facilities, or dedication of land or rights-of-way, shall submit such documentation,

criteria and construction cost estimates if he determines that such estimates submitted by the
developer are either unreliable or inaccurate. The City Engineer shall determine whether facilities or
improvements are eligible for credit or reimbursement.

4-4.1001 FindingsPurpose of provisionsAbandoned vehicle as nuisance.
In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State
under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned vehicles or parts thereof as public
nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property,
not including highways, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an
attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents
and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of
abandoned vehicle or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, except as
expressly hereinafter permitted, is a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the
provision of this chapter.

Not less than a ten-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public

authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. However, the notice of
intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof which is inoperable due to the absence of
a motor, transmission or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than two hundred dollars
($200.00) by a person specified in Vehicle Code Section 22855, and is determined by the local agency to
be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety, provided that the property
owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof.

evidence of registration was recovered pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 22661, subdivision (a), the local
agency shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of intent to dispose of the vehicle or part,

4-4.1010 Vehicle removalRequest for hearingTime limits.
(a) Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or owner of the land received by the City Council within ten
(10) days after the mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, or at the time of signing a
release pursuant to Section 4-4.1009, a public hearing shall be held by the City Council or any other
board, commission, or official of the City, County or City and County as designated by the City
Council. Such hearing shall address the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle or parts
thereof as an abandoned vehicle and the assessment of the administrative costs and cost of removal
of the vehicle or parts thereof against the property on which it is located.
(b) If the owner of the land submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of
the vehicle on the land within such period, the statement shall be construed as a request for a
hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. Notice of the
hearing shall be mailed, by registered or certified mail, at least ten (10) days before the hearing to
the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that
identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not
received within ten (10) days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove the City
shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance without
holding a public hearing.

all facts and testimony it deems pertinent on the condition of the vehicle or parts thereof and the
circumstances concerning its location on the private or public property. The City Council or its
designee shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the
vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written statement in time for
consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with
the reasons for such denial.
(b) The City Council or its designee may impose such conditions and take such other action as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time
for removal of the vehicle or parts thereof if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the
conclusion of the public hearing, the City Council or its designee may find that a vehicle or part
thereof has been abandoned on private or public property, and order the same removed from the
property as a public nuisance as provided in Section 4-4.1012. The order may determine the
administrative cost and costs of removal to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on
which the vehicle or part thereof is located. The order requiring removal shall include a description of
the vehicle or part thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if
available at the site.
(c) If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the
landowner and that the landowner has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the City Council
or its designee shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property
upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from the landowner.
(Ord. 89-09 § 10, 1989)
4-4.1012 Disposal of removed vehicle.

or other final disposition consistent with subsection (e) of Section 22661 of the Vehicle Code. After a
vehicle has been removed it shall not thereafter be reconstructed or made operable unless it is a vehicle

which qualifies for either horseless carriage license plates or historical vehicle license plates pursuant to
Section 5004 of the Vehicle Code, in which case the vehicles may be reconstructed or made operable.
(Ord. 89-09 § 11, 1989)
4-4.1013 Notification of removed vehicles to Department of Motor Vehicles.
Within five (5) days after the date of removal of the vehicle or parts thereof, notice shall be given to
the Department of Motor Vehicles identifying the vehicle or part thereof removed. At the same time, there
shall be transmitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles any evidence of registration available, including,
but not limited to, the registration card, certificates of ownership or license plates.
(Ord. 89-09 § 12, 1989)
4-4.1014 Removal costs assessed against land.
If the administrative costs and the costs of removal which are charged against the owner of the
parcel of land pursuant to Section 4-4.1010 are not paid within thirty (30) days of the date of the date of
order, such costs shall be assessed against the parcel of land pursuant to Section 38773.5 of the

regulated as set forth in this chapter.
5-6.02 PermitsRequiredApplicationsIssuanceConditions.
(a) Required. No person, firm, or corporation, whether as a principal, agent, or otherwise, shall drill,
bore, or otherwise sink, operate, or maintain any oil or gas well without a valid, current, and
subsistent permit from the Council so to do first being had and obtained.
(b) Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to the Council in writing. Such applications
shall state the name of the applicant, the definite location of the proposed well and appurtenant
structures, the purpose for which the well is to be drilled, bored, or otherwise sunk or dug, and a

5-6.04 PermitsLicense fees.
No fee shall be charged for any permit required by the provisions of this chapter, but each permittee
shall pay, for each derrick, well, and/or operation referred to in, or authorized by, any such permit, an
annual license fee or operating charge of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such fee shall be payable
annually in advance on the basis of a calendar year. Only the first annual charge shall be prorated. No
such license fee or operating charge, or any part thereof, shall be refunded. Such license fee or operating
charge shall continue to be paid for each well:
(a) While drilling, mining, pumping, or other operations in or about the well continue, including the
production therefrom of oil, gas or other hydrocarbon substances from a flowing well;
(b) While the derrick remains standing;

in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Division of Oil and Gas of the Department of
Natural Resources of the State and the rules and regulations of the City relating to the
abandonment of such wells; and

reasonably possible to the same condition as that in which they existed at the time of the
granting of such permit.
The license fee or operating charge established for all wells shall become due and be payable on the
date of the granting of such permits by the Council. The annual fees shall become due and payable on
the first day of each and every calendar year. If any license fee or operating charge is not paid within
fifteen (15) days after the license fee or operating charge becomes due and payable, a penalty shall
accrue upon such license fee or operating charge in the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00). Unless such license
fee and such penalty thereon is paid within fifteen (15) days after the date upon which such license fee
and penalty become delinquent, the Council may declare any such permit forfeited, and all rights of the
permittee thereunder shall cease and terminate.
5-6.05 PermitsBonds.
Every permittee shall, either before or at the time of securing the permit required by the provisions of
this chapter, deliver to the City Clerk a bond, approved by the City Attorney as to form and by the Mayor

the City against any loss which may be suffered by the City or to any public property therein located or to
any public street, avenue, alleyway, or place within the City by reason of the drilling, redrilling, existence,
operation, abandonment, or conduct of the well referred to in such permit, or the violation of the terms
Title 5 PUBLIC WELFARE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 15

appurtenances, or any act, whether of commission or omission, on the part of the permittee or any agent
or contractor employed in connection with the well referred to in the permit or any agent or contractor
acting under direction of the permittee.
A good and sufficient bond, as required by the provisions of this section, shall at all times be kept in
full force and effect by the permittee upon any well for which such permittee has been granted a permit
until the permittee has been released from such obligation by completion of the terms of the permit issued

in full force and effect, as set forth in this section, the Council may declare any such permit forfeited, and
all rights of the permittee thereunder shall cease and terminate.

public use prior to the commencement of drilling such well, and intersecting or lying within any

property will not permit such spacing, but in no event less than one hundred (100) feet from
such public street, sidewalk, or highway;

ignition; and
(d) Within two hundred fifty (250) feet of any school building or other place of public assemblage,
such as a church or public library. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when any
such property has been officially closed to public use and proof of such fact has been
established to the satisfaction of the Council.
No permit shall be granted for the drilling, maintaining, or constructing of any oil or gas well in any
areas of the City except those areas which have been or shall be designated as unrestricted districts, as
distinguished from those areas which have been or may be designated as residential or business districts.
5-6.07 Restricted locationsModificationsStandards of limitations.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures
on both public and private property and to provide regulations designed to prevent and control the further
spread of graffiti in the City of Avenal. The increase of graffiti on both public and private buildings,
structures and places is creating a condition of blight within the City which results in a deterioration of
property and business values for adjacent and surrounding properties all to the detriment of the City. The
City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance which should be abated
so as to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti on the City and to prevent the further spread of
graffiti.
(Ord. 91-11 (part), 1992)
5-14.02 Graffiti defined.
For the purposes of this chapter "graffiti" shall mean the unauthorized spraying of paint or marking of
ink, chalk, dye or similar substances on public or private buildings, structures and places.

dye to anyone under the age of eighteen (18) years and no person under the age of eighteen
(18) years shall purchase any pressurized can containing paint or dye.
(b) No person shall have in his or her possession any pressurized can containing any substance
commonly known as paint or dye while in any public park, playground, swimming pool or

5-14.05 Removal of graffiti.
Graffiti may be removed by application of any of the following methods:
(a) Any person applying graffiti within the City shall have the duty to remove the same within
twenty-four (24) hours after notice by the City or the public or private owner of the property
involved. Failure of any person to so remove graffiti shall constitute an additional violation of this
chapter. Where the graffiti is applied by juveniles, the parent or parents shall be responsible for
such removal or for the payment therefor.
(b) Whenever the City Manager or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti is so
located on public or privately owned structures on public or privately owned real property with
this City so as to be capable of being viewed by person utilizing any public right-of-way in this
City, the Police Chief, or his/her designated representative, is authorized, upon City Council
approval, to provide for the removal of the graffiti solely at the City's expense, without
reimbursement from the property owner upon whose property the graffiti has been applied,
upon the following conditions:
(1) In removing the graffiti the painting or repair of a more extensive area shall not be
authorized.
(2) Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than this City, the removal of the graffiti
may be authorized only after securing the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction
over the structure.
(3) Where a structure is privately owned, the removal of the graffiti by City forces or by a

5-17.03 Display of adult material prohibited.
5-17.04 ViolationPenalty.
5-17.05 Public nuisance.
5-17.01 Legislative finding and authorization.
The City Council does find that there exists and has existed an increasing trend towards display of
adult materials at grocery stores, convenient stores, drug stores, video stores and other retail outlets
within the City. This Council recognizes that businesses which sell sexually orientated materials possess
serious objectional operational characteristics which when concentrated can have a deleterious affect
upon adjacent areas. It is recognized that many persons are offended by the public display of certain
sexual material. Further, such adult material is often displayed within the open view of children of tender
years and is easily accessible to them. The City Council finds that this material is adverse to the public
peace, morals and good order of young children. The Council further finds that it is in the best interest of
the public safety, welfare and convenience of the City to prohibit the display of adult material and to adopt
the following regulations so that adverse impacts upon young children are kept to a minimum.
(Ord. 96-01 (part), 1996)
5-17.02 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the following meaning:
"Adult material" means all material that is defined as "harmful matter" in Section 313(a) of the
California Penal Code. Adult material shall include, but not be limited to any magazine, newspaper,
publication, poster, display, video recording or advertisement (including advertising appearing on the
cover or wrapper of merchandise offered for sale or rent to the public) which contains on the outside any
photograph, picture, drawing or depiction of any of the following:
(1) The complete exposure of the entire nipple area or the entire areola area of any female breast;
and
(2) The complete exposure of the entire genitalia or buttocks of either males or females.
(3) This definition of "adult material" does not include any art or photograph publication which
devotes at least twenty-five (25) percent of the lineage of each edition to articles and
advertisements dealing with the subjects of art or photography. Nor does this definition apply to
any news periodical which reports or describes current events and which, from time to time,
publish photographs or depictions of nude or seminude persons when describing cultures in
which nudity or seminudity is indigenous to the population. The City Council finds that medical
publications or bona fide educational publications do not usually publish on their covers any
photograph or depiction which is included in the definition of adult material and that, therefore, it
is not necessary to define this type of publication.
Title 5 PUBLIC WELFARE
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 49
"Display" means exhibiting or exposing adult materials so that it is within open view of patrons,
invitees and visitors to the premises where such material is located, or are visible from any public street,
thoroughfare, sidewalk or pedestrian way or other residential or business premises except in a public
place where minors are excluded and except where devices commonly known as blinder racks are placed
in front of such material so that the lower two-thirds (2/3) of the material is not exposed to view. "Display"
includes the exhibiting of adult material from newsracks or newspaper vending stands.
"Person" means any individual partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other legal entity.
(Ord. 96-01 (part), 1996)
5-17.03 Display of adult material prohibited.
No person shall display adult material or permit or allow the display of adult material.
(Ord. 96-01 (part), 1996)

Any person, whether as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, violating or causing the violation of
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as prescribed in Section
17 of California Penal Code which states that every misdemeanor, except in cases when a different
punishment is prescribed by any law of this State, is punishable by imprisonment in the County Jail not
exceeding six (6) months or by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or both. A violation
may also be punishable as an infraction subject to the procedures set forth in Penal Code Section 19.6

6-1.06 Animals to be impounded.
Every animal kept or found in violation of the provisions of this chapter may be taken up and
impounded by the Chief of Animal Control. Such animal may be redeemed by the owner or person
entitled to its possession within seventy-two (72) hours thereafter on the payment of such fees and
Title 6 SANITATION AND HEALTH
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 5
charges as provided by resolution, but, if not so redeemed, such animal may be destroyed by the Chief of
Animal Control. If no person appears and redeems said dog within seventy-two (72) hours from the giving
of the notice as herein provided, the person in charge of the impound facility may cause and direct the
dog to be sold or may cause and direct the dog to be placed with a home by such person to be suitable.
The receipt for the sale thereof, shall be a valid title to the purchaser, subject, however, to the right of
redemption as set forth in this chapter.
In order to reduce the likelihood that dogs allowed to be at large shall breed unwanted animals, any
dog impounded for being at large which previously has been redeemed from the Animal Control Shelter
after impoundment for being at large shall be spayed or neutered at the redeeming owner's expense prior
to a second or subsequent redemption. The Chief of Animal Control may waive this requirement when
there are extenuating circumstances that justify waiver.
To ensure the sterilization of a redeemed animal, the owner shall be required to pay a seventy-five
dollar ($75.00) deposit to the City of Avenal prior to redeeming his/her dog for spaying or neutering. This
amount may be increased or decreased as the law changes and/or is modified. If the animal is not
sterilized within fourteen (14) business days from the date of redemption/payment of deposit, the deposit
shall be forfeited to the City. Once the animal has been sterilized, as evidenced by a written statement
signed by a licensed veterinarian, the entire deposit will be refunded to the owner within thirty (30) days of
the owner providing such evidence to the City. The forfeited funds may be expended only for programs to
spay/neuter dogs and cats.
In the event the Chief of Animal Control determines that a dog shall be spayed or neutered at the
redeeming owner's expense prior to redemption, the Chief of Animal Control shall notify the owner of this
requirement in writing and inform the owner of the owner's right to appeal as provided in this section.
The owner of the animal may, prior to the date specified by the Chief of Animal Control in the written
notice, appeal the determination of the Chief of Animal Control by filing a notice of such appeal with the
Chief of Animal Control. The City Manager shall appoint a hearing officer, who may be an employee of
the City.
The hearing shall be informal. The hearing officer shall determine, based on evidence presented,
whether the Chief of Animal Control correctly determined that the requirement to spay or neuter applies,
and if so, whether there are any extenuating circumstances which justify waiver of the requirement to
spay or neuter, or waiver of the requirement that the owner pay for the procedure. The decision of the
hearing officer shall be final.
(Ord. No. 2011-03, § 1, 3-24-2011)
6-1.07 Diseased or vicious animals.
Whenever the Chief of Animal Control shall have reasonable cause to believe that any animal, either
licensed or unlicensed, is diseased or vicious or dangerous to any person or other animal, the Chief of
Animal Control is hereby directed to take custody of such animal and impound the animal in a safe place
for such period of time as is required in order to observe, examine, and determine whether or not such
animal is diseased or vicious or dangerous or constitutes a menace to the public health or safety. It shall
be the duty of the Chief of Animal Control to observe and examine any such animal and determine
whether the animal is diseased or vicious or dangerous or does constitute a menace to the public health
or safety. If it is so determined, it shall be unlawful for any person to continue to maintain such animal;
otherwise, such animal shall be returned to the owner or person entitled to its possession.
6-1.08 Notices to owners of animals impounded.
Within twenty-four (24) hours after the impoundment of any animal, the Chief of Animal Control shall
notify the owner or possessor of the animal, if known, that the animal has been impounded and the date
of impounding. If the owner or possessor of such animal is not known to the Chief of Animal Control, the
Title 6 SANITATION AND HEALTH

Chief shall maintain records of such impoundment for at least thirty (30) days after the date of the
impoundment.
6-1.09 Hearings following impoundment.
Any owner or possessor of any animal impounded pursuant to this chapter that is (a) found to be
without proper and adequate food, water, shelter, care, and attention; or (b) found to be diseased or
vicious or dangerous to any person or other animal or has bitten any person or other animal shall be
entitled to a hearing conducted by the City Manager, Health Officer, or designee into such seizure within
ten (10) days following such impoundment provided such owner or possessor files a written request with
the Chief of Animal Control within three (3) days following the notice of such impoundment. In any case,
such owner or possessor shall be liable for all costs related to such seizure.
6-1.10 Redemption.
The owner or person entitled to the control or custody of any animal impounded, at any time before
the sale or other disposition thereof, may redeem the animal by paying all the proper fees and charges
thereon made by virtue of any of the provisions of this chapter. Whenever such animal is redeemed, the
person redeeming shall receive from the Chief of Animal Control duplicate receipts for the same. The
Chief of Animal Control shall give to any person redeeming such animal a receipt for the redemption
money.

of an effective cross-connection control program and for enforcement of the provisions of this article.
(b) "Approved" means accepted by the Director as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in
this article, or as suitable for the proposal use.
(c) "Auxiliary water supply" means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the City's
approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another public
potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or
"used water" or "industrial fluids." These waters may be polluted or contaminated or they may be
objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the City does not have
sanitary control.
(d) "Backflow" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the
distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source or sources other than its
intended source.
(e) "Back-siphonage" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the
distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended sources
caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system.
(f) "Backflow preventer" means a device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-siphonage.
(g) "Air-gap" means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest
opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the
flood level rim of said vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply
pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel; and, in no case less than one inch.
When an air-gap is used at the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the
City's potable water system, an emergency by-pass shall be installed around the air-gap system and
an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the by-pass system.
(h) "Reduced pressure principle device" means an assembly of two (2) independently operating
approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valves between the two (2)

and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and City-approved testing agency for
Title 6 SANITATION AND HEALTH
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 32
backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone
between the two (2) check valves at a level less than the pressure on the City water supply side of
the device. At cessation of normal flow the pressure between the check valves shall be less than the
supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to
maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2)
pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved these
devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location
where no part of the device will be submerged.

(p) "Pollution" means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic or biological) in water
which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of
the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does
adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use.
(q) WaterPotable. "Potable water" means any water which, according to recognized standards is safe
for human consumption.
(r) WaterNonpotable. "Nonpotable water" means water which is not safe for human consumption or
which is of questionable potability.
(s) WaterService connections. "Service connections water" means the terminal end of a service
connection from the City's potable water system; i.e., where the City loses jurisdiction and sanitary
control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at
the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the
meter. There should be not unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or
backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service
connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or
emergency water service connections from the public potable water system.

additional water, is necessary to insure that the public health, safety and welfare would not be
jeopardized.

approved so long as the amount of water does not increase and the project site and proponent do
not change.
(b) Payment of the surcharge shall entitle the project proponent to its water estimate for a specific
project and cannot be transferred to another project, property, or person, except that a transfer to a
new person may be allowed under the following circumstances, subject to City Council approval:

project.
(e) A personal hardship may only be approved by the Council, after review by the Planning Commission.
(f) Application for transfer of the water estimate as part of a hardship shall be made in writing by the
project proponent and that following information shall be provided:

transferred to a new person after final occupancy has been approved by the City. The project which
has been approved by the City for phased development may be transferred with the project to a new
person after a phase has been approved for final occupancy.

decay, or termites;
(3) Is so unsanitary or filthy that it would constitute a hazard to the health of the persons who will
occupy said building after relocation or, if not intended for occupancy by human beings, would
make it unsuitable for its intended use;
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 4
(4) Is in such condition or is of a type, character, size, or value and is so inharmonious with other
buildings in the neighborhood of the relocation site, that placing the building at the proposed
relocation site would substantially diminish the value of other property or improvements within a
radius of five hundred (500) feet from the proposed relocation site;
(5) If the proposed use of the building is prohibited at the proposed relocation site under any zoning
ordinance or other land use ordinance of the City;

(c) Correction of defects before issuance; hearing.
(1) If the building or structure to be moved fails to meet any of the standards set forth in subsection

the permit shall be issued only on condition that all deficiencies be corrected.
(2) In order to determine any matter regarding relocation of a building or structure, the Building
Official may cause any investigation to be made which he believes necessary.
(d) Terms and conditions to issuance. In granting a relocation permit, there may be imposed such terms
and conditions as are reasonable including but not limited to, changes, alterations, additions or

moved. The terms and conditions upon which each permit is granted shall be in writing upon
application and permit or appended thereto.

(2) An application for extension of the six (6) months time limitation set forth in subsection (a) of this
section may be submitted to the Board of Appeals within six (6) months from the date of
issuance of the permit. The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing upon such application
for extension of time. No such application shall be approved by the Board of Appeals except
where it appears that the failure of applicant to comply with the terms and conditions of the
permit was due to fire, legal acts of the public authorities, acts of God, or any other delay
unavoidable or beyond the reasonable control of the applicant. An application for extension of
time shall be denied by the Board of Appeals if the applicant fails to appear in person at the time
and place set for the public hearing on such application, unless there is presented at such
hearing a certificate of a licensed physician that such applicant is physically unable to appear at
such hearing due to illness or other physical incapacity, or the applicant is represented at such
hearing by an attorney.

months from date of the expiration of the original permit.
(4) A second extension of time shall not be issued to any applicant by the Board of Appeals. The
Board of Appeals may, in its discretion, accept an application for extension of time from a
person who has succeeded to the ownership of property which was the subject of an extension
of time granted to a former owner-applicant.

therefor shall first post with the Building Official a bond executed by the owner of the premises where
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 5
the building or structure is to be located, as principal, and by a surety company authorized to do
business in the state, as surety, or makes a deposit of cash or cashier's check or money order

equal to the cost plus ten (10) percent of such work.
(i) Condition. Every bond posted and every deposit made pursuant to this article shall be conditioned as
follows:
(1) That each and all of the terms and conditions of the moving permit shall be complied with to the
satisfaction of the Building Official;
(2) That all of the work required to be done pursuant to the conditions of the moving permit shall be

the principal and to the surety on the bond.

done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by him to be reasonably necessary
for the completion of such work.
(l) When work to be done by City. If after written notice the required work is not performed within the
time specified in such notice, then the City at its option may, through its authorized officers or agents,
cause such work to be done, or cause such building or structure to be demolished and the premises
cleared, and the surety shall pay over to the county or to the Building Official the actual cost of such
work or demolition, plus an additional sum of ten (10) percent; provided, however, that in no case
shall the liability of the surety exceed the amount of the surety bond; or the City may, at its option,
through its Building Official or other authorized agent, require the surety to cause the required work
to be performed or require the surety to demolish the structure or building or clear, clean and restore
the site; provided, that in neither case shall the liability of the surety exceed the amount of the surety
bond.
(m) Use of cash deposit. If a cash bond has been posted the Building Official shall give notice of default,
as provided above to the principal, and if compliance is not had within the time specified the Building
Official shall proceed without delay and without further notice or proceeding whatever, to use the
cash deposit or any portion of such deposit to cause the required work to be done by contract or
otherwise in his discretion. The balance, if any, of such cash deposit, upon the completion of the
work, shall be returned to the depositor or to his successors or assigns after deducting the cost of
the work plus ten (10) percent thereof.
(n) Return of deposit. When a cash bond has been posted, the Building Official shall return the cash to
the depositor or to his successors or assigns upon the termination of the bond, except any portion
thereof that may have been used or deducted as elsewhere in this article provided.

(p) Interference with work. In the event of any default in the performance of any term or condition of the
relocation permit, the surety or any person employed or engaged on its behalf, or the Building
Official, or any person employed or engaged on his behalf, may go upon the premises to complete
the required work or to remove or demolish the building or structure. The owner, his representative,
successor or assign, or any other person who interferes with or obstructs the ingress or egress to or
from any such premises, or any authorized representative or agent of any surety or of the City
engaged in the work of completing, demolishing or removing any building or structure for which a
relocation permit has been issued, after a default has occurred in the performance of the terms or
conditions thereof, is guilty of an infraction.

Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 11

promptly inspected by the Public Works Director, and if the work complies in all respects with the
provisions of this chapter and with the permit, a certificate of approval shall be given by the Public Works
Director to the permittee. In the event the work does not comply in all respects with the provisions of this
chapter and with the permit, a certificate of approval shall be withheld until and unless a subsequent
inspection discloses compliance. In the further event the antenna, as erected, does not comply with the
provisions of this chapter or in other respects does not appear to be erected, supported, and guyed in a
reasonably safe manner, the Public Works Director shall instruct the person who erected such antenna to
either make corrections so the antenna, as erected, will comply with the provisions of this chapter and
reasonable safety, or to remove the antenna.

Section 8-2.03 of this chapter.
Except for test purposes, and except for cases not requiring the issuance of a permit, no television or
radio antenna shall be placed in use until a certificate of approval is obtained.
8-2.09 Maintenance inspectionsNotices of dangerous conditions.

8-5.101 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has, pursuant to Government Code sections 65302, 65560,
and 65800, conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Avenal
hereby adopts the following floodplain management regulations and hereby repeals Ordinance No. 95-07.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1.1, 3-12-2009)
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 14
8-5.102 Findings of fact.
(a) The flood hazard areas of City of Avenal are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected
from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which
increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1.2, 3-12-2009)
8-5.103 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within
flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
(a) Protect human life and health;
(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric,
telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of
special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
(h) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1.3, 3-12-2009)
8-5.104 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1.4, 3-12-2009)

8-5.201 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application.
"A zone." See "Special flood hazard area."
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either:
(1) Solely for the parking of no more than two (2) cars; or

"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision
for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of Ordinance No. 95-07
(adopted on May 25, 1995).
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of

(2) The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.
"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazards and the floodway.
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency

hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration
that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the
water surface elevation of the base flood.
"Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from
any source. See "Flooding."
"Floodplain Administrator" is the local official designated by the City of Avenal to administer and
enforce the floodplain management regulations.
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in
the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion
control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved realproperty,

not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of Avenal will
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 17
consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a
part of the community for fifty (50) to one-hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be
constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage
from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future
owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be
insured only at very high flood insurance rates.
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities
that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt
and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.
"Hardship" as related to Article 6 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Avenal requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or
the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of
these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative
is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use
than originally intended.
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
"Historic structure" means any structure that is:
(1) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the

the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the
historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;
(3) Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation
programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or
(4) Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation
programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the
Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to
provide protection from temporary flooding.
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in
accord with sound engineering practices.
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see
"Basement" definition).
(1) An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered
a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
a. The flood openings standard in Section 8-5.501(c)(3);
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 18
b. The anchoring standards in Section 8-5.501(a);
c. The construction materials and methods standards in Section 8-5.501(b); and
d. The standards for utilities in Section 8-5.502.
(2) For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to
be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and
storage areas.
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the
required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into
two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
"Market value" is defined in the City of Avenal Substantial Damage/Improvement Procedures. See
Section 8-5.402(b)(1).
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other
datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
"New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of Ordinance No. 95-07 (adopted on May 25,
1995), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of Ordinance No. 95-
07 (adopted on May 25, 1995).
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock,
gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water,
or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood
of being carried downstream.
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood."
"Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or
administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management
regulations.
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Article 6 of this chapter, means that the granting of a
variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or
neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in
the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
(1) Built on a single chassis;
(2) Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
(3) Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
(4) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 19
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation more than one foot.
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State
or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its
noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or
otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to
the structure or other development.
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook,
etc.
"Sheet flow area." See "Area of shallow flooding."
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1A30,
AE, A99, or, AH.
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and
means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas
or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure
before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
(1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(2) Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in
a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this
chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 20
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic
feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated

(1) Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of
substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;
(2) All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
(3) The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
(4) The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where
base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This
means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Avenal; and
(5) All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional
letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed
flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction"
definition.
(b) Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.
(1) Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged
Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for
substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value."
(2) Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by
City of Avenal staff.
(c) Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has
not been provided in accordance with Section 8-5.302, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain,
review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article 5.
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA
publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA
Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995.
(d) Notification of Other Agencies.
(1) Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior
to alteration or relocation;
b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
and
c. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse is maintained.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 23
(2) Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations:
a. Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion,
whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the
permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map
revision (LOMR).
b. All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building
permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map
revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood
control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction"definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes
affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management
requirements are based on current data.
(3) Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate
boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map
of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
(e) Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make
available as needed the following:
(1) Certification required by Section 8-5.501(c)(1) and Section 8-5.504 (lowest floor
elevations);
(2) Certification required by Section 8-5.501(c)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential
structures);
(3) Certification required by Section 8-5.501(c)(3) (wet floodproofing standard);
(4) Certification of elevation required by Section 8-5.503(a)(3) (subdivisions and other
proposed development standards);
(5) Certification required by Section 8-5.506(b) (floodway encroachments); and
(6) Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(f) Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section 8-5.404.
(g) Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 8-
5.303.
(h) Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA.
(i) Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives
herein.

8-5.506 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(a) Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A130 and AE, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one (1) foot at any point within the City of Avenal.
(b) Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Avenal shall prohibit encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless
certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed

Article 6. Variance Procedure
8-5.601 Nature of variances.
8-5.602 Conditions for variances.
8-5.603 Appeal Board.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 29
8-5.601 Nature of variances.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates
are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of
zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be
granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the
requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding
property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the
property owners.
It is the duty of the City of Avenal to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling
and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances
form the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term
goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited.
Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple
provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to
screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 6.1, 3-12-2009)
8-5.602 Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that
the procedures of Articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Article 2
of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary"
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a
minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City of Avenal need not grant permission for the applicant
to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation
which the City of Avenal believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local
ordinance.
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 30
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is
recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the
Office of the Recorder of the County of Kings and shall be recorded in a manner so that it
appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(f) The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for
their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(g) Variances shall only be issued upon a:
(1) Showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the
applicant; and
(3) Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety
and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(h) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new
development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions
of Sections 8-5.602(a) through (d) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in
additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(i) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 8-5.602(a) and the purposes of this chapter, the City
Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 6.2, 3-12-2009)
8-5.603 Appeal Board.
(a) In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2) Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
(4) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6) Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or
erosion damage;
(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
(9) Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters
expected at the site; and
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 31
(11) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
system, and streets and bridges.

hearing in the manner following:
(1) Such notice shall be given by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation, published
in the City and circulated in the school district, or if there is none, then in a newspaper ofgeneral
circulation published and circulated in the City;

(1) That the powers authorized by this chapter will be exercised in such area; or
(2) That there are specific overriding fiscal, economic, social, or environmental factors which, in the
judgment of the Council, would benefit the City, thereby justifying the approval of a residential
development otherwise subject to this chapter.

8-6.07 Determinations of applicability.
If the Council concurs with the school district's findings, and if the Council determines that there are
no overriding factors which excuse the exercise of this chapter, the Council shall adopt a resolution
designating the area to which this chapter shall apply. Within such areas, this chapter shall apply to any
residential development which results in one or more dwelling units, including a residential subdivision of
one or more lots, multiple residential projects of one or more units, and mobile home parks with one or
more spaces. This chapter shall not apply to the conversion of existing residential units to another form of
ownership or operation, nor to a development which limits residency to persons fifty (50) years of age or
older. If such a development subsequently allows residence by younger persons, this chapter shall be
applicable at that time.
(85-09 (part), 1985; Ord. 86-01 (part), 1986)
8-6.08 Dedication of land or payment of feesProcedures.
Upon the adoption of the resolution referred to in Section 8-6.07 of this chapter, developments
subject to this chapter shall dedicate land, pay fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, for classroom
and related facilities for elementary or high schools as a condition of the approval of such residential
developments provided that:
(a) The land or fees, or both, transferred to the school district shall be used only for the purpose of
providing interim elementary or high school classrooms and related facilities; and
(b) The location and amount of land to be dedicated or the amount of fees to be paid, or both, shall
bear a reasonable relationship and will be limited to the needs of the community for interim
elementary or high school facilities and shall be reasonably related and limited to the need for
schools caused by the development; provided, however, the fees shall not exceed the amount
necessary to pay five (5) annual lease payments for the interim facilities. In lieu of the fees, the
builder of a residential development, at his or her option and at his or her expense, may provide
interim facilities, owned or controlled by such builder, at the place designated by the school
district, and, at the conclusion of the fifth school year, the builder, at the builder's expense, shall
remove the interim facilities from such place; and
(c) A finding is made by the Council that the facilities to be constructed from such fees or the land
to be dedicated, or both, is consistent with the General Plan.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.09 Collection of fees.
The fees required by this chapter shall be imposed at the time the building permit is issued,
irrespective of whether a tentative map has been approved prior to the adopting of this chapter. In cases
where a building permit is not required, the payment or dedication of land shall be a condition precedent
to the provision of water to the project by the City. Such fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing trust
account, to be used for no other purpose. The City Manager and Superintendent of Schools shall
administratively adopt procedures for the transfer of the funds from the City to the school district. Such
fees shall not be considered City "proceeds of taxes" under Article XIIIB of the Constitution of the State.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.10 In-lieu fees.
No fees shall be imposed on a development covered by this chapter where at the time of the
issuance of a building permit, the Building Official of the City shall have on file a letter from the
superintendent of the Reef-Sunset School District, stating that an agreement or arrangement between the
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 35
developer and the school district has been reached offsetting any impacts from that specific development.
(Ord. 86-01, 1986)
8-6.11 Dedication of land.
If the school district requests dedication rather than the payment of the fee, the value of the land
dedicated shall be substantially identical to the amount of fees which would have been collected. Such
value shall be based on the market value of the land at the time of filing the tentative map. The school
district may not require dedication rather than the payment of fees if the subdivision consists of fifty (50)
parcels or less.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.12 Amendment of fee schedule.
The Council, by resolution, may amend the fee schedule adopted by this chapter upon its own
initiative or upon a request by the school district to do so.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.13 Use of feesAccount keeping.
The school district receiving funds pursuant to this chapter shall maintain a separate account for the
fees paid and shall file a report with the Council on the balance in the account at the end of the previous
fiscal year and the facilities leased, purchased, or constructed during the previous fiscal year. In addition,
the report shall specify which attendance areas will continue to be overcrowded when the fall term begins
and where conditions of overcrowding will no longer exist. Such report shall be filed by August 1 of each
year and shall be filed more frequently at the request of the Council.
If overcrowding conditions no longer exist, the City shall cease levying any fee or requiring the
dedication of any land pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.14 Further levying of fees or dedications restricted.
One year after the receipt of an apportionment pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene State School
Building Lease-Purchase Law of 1976 (Chapter 22, commencing with Section 17700 of Part 10 of the
Education Code of the State) for the construction of a school, the City shall not be permitted thereafter to
levy any fee or to require the dedication of any land within the attendance area of the district. However,
any time after the receipt of the apportionment there may be a determination of overcrowding if there is
the further finding:
(a) That during the period of construction additional overcrowding would occur from continued
residential development; and
(b) That any fee levied and any required dedication of land levied after the receipt of the
construction apportionment can be used to avoid the additional overcrowding prior to the school
being available for use by the school district.
Any amount of fees collected or land dedicated after the receipt of the construction apportionment
and not used to avoid overcrowding shall be returned to the person who paid the fee or made the land
dedication.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)

8-6.15 Failure to complete developmentEffect.
(a) If a final subdivision map, parcel map, conditional use permit, development plan, or building permit is
cancelled, voided, or lapses, and if the City still retains the land and/or fees collected for it, and if the
applicant so requests, the Council shall order that such land and/or fees be returned to the applicant.
(b) If a final subdivision map, parcel map, conditional use permit, development plan, or building permit is
cancelled or voided, and if the school district still retains the land or fees transferred to it by the City,
and if the applicant so requests, the school district shall return to the applicant such land and/or fees.
(Ord. 85-09 (part), 1985)
8-6.16 Termination of requirements.
(a) If overcrowding conditions cease to exist in any attendance area of a school district as to which fee
or land dedication requirements have been imposed pursuant to this chapter, the governing board of
the district shall promptly adopt a resolution so finding and send a certified copy of it to the City
Council.
(b) When it is determined by the City Council that conditions of overcrowding no longer exist in an
attendance area, whether or not such determination follows a resolution by the governing board as
provided in subsection (a) of this section, the requirements of this chapter shall cease to apply
therein.

8-7.07 Paved parking lot requirements.
(a) General.
(1) Fifty (50) percent of paved parking lot's surface shall be shaded by tree canopies within fifteen
(15) years of planting.
(2) Trees planted to satisfy the requirements of these guidelines are landscaping as defined by this
Code and are subject to established landscaping requirements.
(b) Site plan required. A landscaping plan which details the degree of compliance with the Landscape
Ordinance is required. The plan shall show:
(1) All landscaped areas.
(2) Tree canopies drawn to scale representing the estimated canopy at a fifteen-year growth period.
(3) The total area in square feet of the paved parking lot, driveways, and maneuver areas; and the
area shaded by tree canopies. A schedule listing total parking area, shaded area, and the
percentage of parking area shaded should be included.
(4) A schedule of the specific names of proposed trees and their sizes.
(5) Such plan shall be approved by the Building Department prior to issuance of building permits.
However, the plan is encouraged to be submitted at the time of site plan review.
(c) Methodology.
(1) To simplify the process of determining compliance, the true angle of deflection of natural
sunlight shall not be considered. Shaded areas shall be assumed to be only those portions of a
paved parking lot directly beneath the shading canopy or drip line.
(2) Shading shall be provided by tree canopies except that any portion of a paved parking lot
directly beneath and shaded by a man-made structure (overhangs and covered parking for
instance) shall be deleted from the requirements of these performance standards and shall be
subtracted from the area of the parking lot to be shaded.
(3) Credit shall be given only for surface area shaded. Multiple canopies shading the same surface
area will not be counted as multiple credit.
(4) Landscape planters beneath the canopy may be considered as shaded paved parking areas for
the purpose of determining compliance.
(5) Where more than five (5) trees are to be planted in the entire parking area, tree species shall be
mixed.
(6) Trees planted along the perimeter of a lot may be counted as providing shade for the full area of
their canopy.
(7) If the degree of overlap between trees is less than fifteen (15) percent all trees may be counted
as shading one hundred (100) percent of their canopy. If the degree of overlap is fifteen (15)
percent or greater then it will be necessary to perform individual calculation to determine the
area of shading.
(8) A community service area, free from tree planting, may be allowed if a facility first demonstrates
that it has met the minimum shading requirements on the overall site.
(9) A ten (10) percent minor deviation of the shading standard may be approved by the Building
Official in accordance with established procedures in this Code if it is found that the normal
standards would impose an undue hardship.
(d) Minimum tree requirements.
(1) Provide one fifteen-gallon tree for every two (2) required parking spaces.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 40
(2) Disperse trees over the parking lot area to provide fifty (50) percent shading of the parking area
surface within fifteen (15) years. Trees shall also be planted in the required landscaped areas
along the periphery of the development in order to shade and enhance adjacent property and
public rights-of-way.
(3) Trees shall be maintained in good health. Trees shall not be topped to reduce the natural height
or headed to reduce the overall crown of the tree. Thinning cuts are preferred to remove dead,
diseased or dying growth and to establish well spaced and strong scaffold structure for public
safety and shade value.
(e) Minimum sight triangle.
(1) Ten (10) feet in traffic areas.
(2) Thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) feet at street intersections.
(3) One hundred (100) feet at major street intersections.
(4) Trees within triangle shall be trimmed up to eight (8) feet minimum above the surface of the
parking lot.
(5) Other landscaping (groundcover and shrubs) shall not exceed two and one-half (2½) feet above
the parking surface.

8-7.09 Public nuisance.
Any work in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any land use contrary to the provisions of
this chapter shall be and is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The City Manager shall
initiate all necessary legal proceedings for the abatement, removal and enjoinment necessary to
accomplish these ends, and may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to grant such relief as will
abate the use and restrain and enjoin the person, firm or corporation or organization from maintaining or
using the site contrary to the provisions of this chapter. The remedies prescribed by this section are
cumulative and not exclusive.

(b) Waste Management Plan: Prior to starting the project, every applicant shall submit a properly
completed "Waste Management Plan" (WMP) as required under Section 8-9.06 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.04 Diversion requirement.
Unless otherwise exempted, each covered project must divert from disposal at least fifty (50) percent
of waste material, consisting of any combined proportion of construction and demolition debris and inert
debris, generated from said project.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.05 Diversion requirement exemption.
(a) Application: If an applicant for a covered project experiences circumstances that the applicant
believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for a
diversion exemption at the time the applicant submits a Waste Management Plan required under
Section 8-9.07 of this chapter.
(b) Meeting with WMP Compliance Official: The WMP Compliance Official shall review the information
supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss feasible ways of satisfying the
diversion requirement. Upon request by the applicant, the WMP Compliance Official may requestthat
City staff attend this meeting or may require the applicant to request a separate meeting with the City
staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant, City staff (if applicable), and the WMP
Compliance Official shall determine whether it is feasible for the applicant to satisfy the diversion
requirement.
(c) Granting of Exemption: If the WMP Compliance Official determines that it is infeasible for the
applicant to meet the diversion requirements, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible
diversion rate for waste generated by the covered project and shall indicate the new diversion
requirement the applicant shall be required to meet, and will inform the applicant in writing of the new
requirement. The applicant shall then have fourteen (14) days to resubmit another WMP, which is in
compliance with the new diversion requirement. If the applicant fails to resubmit, or if the resubmitted
WMP does not comply with Section 8-9.07, the WMP Compliance Official shall disapprove the WMP
in accordance with Section 8-9.07.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.06 Exempt covered projects.
(a) A diversion deposit and a Waste Management Plan shall not be required for the following:
(1) Work for which a building or demolition permit is not required.
(2) Residential and non-residential alterations of less than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) in value.
(3) Roofing projects that do not include tear-off of existing roof.
(4) Work for which only a plumbing, only an electrical, or only a mechanical permit is required.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 45
(5) Seismic tie-down projects.
(6) Emergency demolition required to protect the public health and safety.
(b) While not required, it shall be encouraged, that at least twenty-five (25) percent of all existing
construction and demolition waste from exempt projects be diverted.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.07 Waste management plan.
(a) Prior to starting the project, every applicant must submit a properly completed "Waste Management
Plan" (WMP) to the WMP Compliance Official, in a form prescribed by that official, as a portion of the
building or demolition permit process. The completed WMP must contain all of the following:
(1) The estimated volume or weight of project waste to be generated by material type;
(2) A determination of whether or not materials will be sorted on-site or mixed;
(3) The maximum volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse,
recycling or salvage for future use or sale by material type;
(4) The vendor(s) that the applicant proposes to use to haul the materials;
(5) Facility(s) the materials will be hauled to, and their expected diversion rates (by volume or
weight) for each material type; and
(6) Estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition waste that will be disposed.
(b) Because actual material weights are not available in this stage, estimates are used. In estimating the
volume or weight of materials as identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the standardized
conversion rates approved by the City for this purpose. Approval of the WMP as complete and
accurate shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any building or demolition permit. If the
applicant calculates the projected feasible diversion rate as described above, and concludes that the
projected diversion rate does not satisfy the applicable diversion requirement, the applicant must
then submit information supporting the lower diversion rate. If this documentation is not included, the
WMP shall be deemed incomplete.
(c) Approval: No building or demolition permit shall be issued for any covered project unless and until
the WMP Compliance Official has approved the WMP. Approval shall not be required, however,
where emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety. The WMP Compliance
Official shall only approve a WMP if he or she determines that all of the following conditions are
satisfied:
(1) The WMP provides all of the information set forth in this section.
(2) The WMP indicates that at least fifty (50) percent of all construction and demolition waste
generated by the project (or the new diversion goal set in accordance with the applicant's
approved diversion exemption request) shall be diverted from disposal; and
(3) The applicant has submitted all required fees, deposits and/or bonds for the project.
(d) Non-Approval: If the WMP Compliance Official determines that the WMP is incomplete or fails to
indicate that at least fifty (50) percent, or the new diversion goal set in accordance with the
applicant's approved diversion exemption request (if applicable) of all construction and demolition
waste generated by the project will be diverted from disposal, he or she shall either:
(1) Return the WMP to the applicant marked "Disapproved", including a statement of reasons, and
will notify the building department, which shall then immediately stop processing the building or
demolition permit application; or
(2) Return the WMP to the applicant marked "Further Explanation Required."
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 46
8-9.08 Deposit required.
(a) As a condition precedent to the issuance of any permit for construction or demolition for a covered
project, the applicant shall post a deposit (cash, letter of credit, performance or surety bond, money
order) in an amount to be determined by the Public Works Director and approved by the City
Manager.
(b) The deposit shall be returned, without interest, in total or pro-rated, upon proof of satisfaction by the
WMP Compliance Official that no less than the required percentage of construction and demolition
waste tonnage generated by the covered project was diverted from disposal and has been recycled
or reused or stored for later reuse or recycling. If a lesser percentage of construction and demolition
waste tonnage than required is diverted, a proportionate share of the deposit shall be returned. The
deposit shall be forfeited entirely or to the pro-rated extent that there was a failure to comply with the
requirements of this chapter. The City may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required
deposit.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.09 On-site practices.
(a) During the term of the covered project, the applicant shall recycle and reuse the required percentage
of waste, and keep records of the tonnage or other measurements approved by the City that can be
converted to tonnage amounts. The WMP Compliance Official will evaluate and may monitor each
covered project to determine the percentage of waste salvaged and recycled or reused from the
covered project.
(b) For covered projects including both construction and demolition, diversion of materials shall be
tracked and measured separately.
(c) To the maximum extent feasible, project waste shall be separated on-site if this practice increases
diversion. For construction and/or demolition projects, on-site separation shall include salvageable
materials (e.g., appliances, fixtures, plumbing, metals, etc.,) and dimensional lumber, wallboard,
concrete and corrugated cardboard.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.10 Reporting.
(a) Within fourteen (14) days after completion of the demolition phase of a covered project, and again
within fourteen (14) days following the completion of the construction phase of a covered project, the
applicant/permitee shall, as a condition precedent to final inspection and to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy or final approval of project, submit documentation to the WMP Compliance
Official that proves compliance with the requirements of Section 8-9.07 (Waste Management Plan)
and Section 8-9.04 (diversion requirement). The documentation shall consist of a final completed
WMP showing actual waste tonnage data, supported by original or certified photocopies of receipts
and weight tags or other records of measurement from recycling companies, deconstruction
contractors, and/or landfill and disposal companies. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify
whether waste generated from the covered project has been or are to be recycled, reused, salvaged
or disposed. The applicant/permitee shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all designated
recyclable and reusable waste salvaged or disposed are measured and recorded using the most
accurate method of measurement available.
(b) To the extent practical, all construction and demolition waste shall be weighed in compliance with all
regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition waste for
which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement
shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the
standardized conversion rates approved by the City for this purpose.
Title 8 BUILDING REGULATIONS
Avenal, California, Code of Ordinances Page 47
(c) If a covered project involves both demolition and construction, the report and documentation for the
demolition project must be submitted and approved by the WMP Compliance Official before issuance
of a building permit for the construction phase of a covered project. Alternatively, the applicant may
submit a letter stating that no waste or recyclable materials were generated from the covered project,
in which case this statement shall be subject to verification by the WMP Compliance Official. Any
deposit posted pursuant to Section 8-9.08 (deposit required) shall be forfeited if the applicant does
not meet the timely reporting requirements of this section.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.11 Violations; fines/penalties.
Any permitee, applicant, contractor and owner whose covered project violates any provision of this
chapter shall be subject to the penalty provisions of Title 1, Chapter 2 of the Avenal Municipal Code.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.12 Appeals.
(a) Any person aggrieved by the decision or determination of the WMP Compliance Officer may appeal
the same pursuant to Title 1, Chapter 4 of the Avenal Municipal Code.
(b) Decisions and determinations subject to appeal under this section include decisions and
determinations pertaining to the requirements under this chapter, including but not necessarily be
limited to:
(1) The granting or denial of an exemption;
(2) Rejection of a Waste Management Plan;
(3) The amount or type of deposit required or released; and
(4) Whether the applicant has acted in good faith.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)
8-9.13 Option to revise.
(a) Beginning on July 1, 2012, the City will evaluate the requirements of this Chapter to determine its
effectiveness in reducing the amount of construction and demolition waste disposed. In this
determination, the City will consider issues such as the amount of construction and demolition waste
disposed, volume of construction and demolition activity, markets for construction and demolition
waste, and other barriers encountered by applicants.
(b) If the City determines the construction and demolition waste disposed had the potential for diversion,
then the City may amend these provisions and implement the necessary measures to divert more
construction and demolition waste.
(Ord. No. 2011-04, § 2, 4-14-2011)

Housing Act.
9.16.02 Application. (a) Any person who requests reasonable
accommodation, because of a disability, in the application of a zoning
or building law, policy or procedure, which may act as a barrier to fair
housing opportunities, may do so by filing a completed application
with the director of community development ("director"). The director
shall promulgate application forms for this purpose.
(b) If the project for which the request is being made also requires
some other approval, permit or entitlement, the applicant shall file the
request together with the application for such approval, permit or
entitlement.

information:
9.16-1

(e) The basis for the claim that the applicant is considered disabled
under the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 or the
California Fair Employment Housing Act; and
(f) A detailed explanation of why the accommodation is reasonable
and why the accommodation is necessary to afford the applicant an
equal opportunity to use and enjoy a specific dwelling in the city.
9.16.04 Notice of request for accommodation. Written notice of a request for
reasonable accommodation shall be given as follows:
(a) In the event that there is no approval sought other than the
request for reasonable accommodation, the notice shall be mailed to
the owners of record of all properties which are immediately adjacent
to the property which is the subject of the request.
(b) In the event that the request is being made in conjunction with
some other approval, permit or entitlement, the notice shall be
transmitted along with the notice of the other proceeding.
9.16.05 Procedure. (a) The director shall review each application for
reasonable accommodation and, within five days of receipt thereof,
determine whether the application is complete. If the application is
determined to be incomplete, the director shall promptly give the
applicant written notice of the additional information necessary to
complete the application.
(b) Within 30 days of receipt of an application that has been
determined to be complete, the director shall complete a review of
the application and, pursuant to the standards provided in section 9.
16.06, either approve, approve subject to conditions or deny the
request. However, in the event that the applicant also seeks an
approval, permit or other entitlement that is reviewed by the Planning
Commission, then the Planning Commission shall review the
application for reasonable accommodation.
9.16-2

make a request for a director's hearing of the decision.
(e) If no request for hearing is received, the decision shall become
final.
9.16.06 Grounds for accommodation. In making a determination about the
reasonableness of a requested accommodation, the following factors
shall be considered:
(a) Whether the accommodation is reasonable considering the
nature of the applicant's disability, the surrounding land uses, and the
rule, standard, policy, or practice from which relief is sought;
(b) Whether the accommodation is necessary to afford the applicant
equal opportunity to enjoy and use a specific dwelling in the city;
(c) Whether the accommodation will have only incidental economic
or monetary benefits to the applicant, and whether the primary
purpose of the accommodation is to assist with real estate
speculation or excess profit making;
(d) Whether the accommodation will create a substantial adverse
impact on surrounding land uses, or a public nuisance, that cannot
be reasonably mitigated;
(e) Whether the accommodation is reasonably feasible considering
the physical attributes of the property and structures;
(f) Whether there are alternative accommodations which may
provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant, while
minimizing adverse impacts on surrounding land uses and lessening
the financial and/or administrative burden on the city;
(g) Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the city; and

granted for an individual with a disability shall be a personal
accommodation for the individual applicant and shall not run with the
land, unless the director determines that it would be impractical to
require the property to be returned to its previous condition once the
disabled person no longer occupies the property. Prior to the
issuance of a building permit or any other applicable permit for such
modification, the permittee shall execute a notarized statement that
permits the city to inspect the affected property at least annually to
verify compliance with this chapter and with any applicable conditions
of approval. Prior to any transfer of interest in the property, the
permittee shall notify the transferee of the existence of the
accommodation, the personal status of the accommodation and the
requirements that the tranferee must apply for a new accommodation
as necessary. Except as otherwise provided by the director, as set
forth herein, once such transfer takes effect the accommodation shall
have no further validity.
9.16.10 Appeal. The decision of the director or the planning and
transportation commission shall be subject to appeal pursuant to the
procedures set forth in chapter 9.75.02.B of the Ordinance.

written request, the Community Development Director may reduce the number of
spaces required in such cases by up to fifty (50) percent if it can be determined
based on substantial evidence that the combination of uses in the same or adjacent
buildings or premises will, at periods of peak weekly hour use, necessitate provision
of a lower number of parking spaces than if the uses were developed independently.
Parking facilities may be shared if multiple uses cooperatively establish and operate
the facilities and if these uses generate parking demands primarily during hours
when the remaining uses are not in operation. The applicant shall have the burden of
proof for a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces, and
documentation shall be submitted substantiating their reasons for the requested
parking reduction. Public rights of way and/or on street parking shall not be used or

9.64.08 WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE WORKSHEET.
A. A project applicant shall complete the following Water Efficient Landscape
Worksheets as identified in Appendix B:
1. A hydrozone information table (see Appendix B, Section A) for the
landscape project; and
2. A water budget calculation (see Appendix B, Section B) for the landscape
project.
B. Water budget calculations shall adhere to the following requirements:
1. Plant types shall be grouped so as to have zoned landscape areas that utilize a
similar water requirement. The cumulative effect of this zoning shall be to
create a moderate water consuming landscape. The zone types shall be
designated low, moderate or high water use with reference to water
consumptiveness. The plant factor value used shall be taken from WUCOLS
(a copy of this can be obtained form the City Public Works Department). The
plant factor ranges from 0 to 0.3 for low water use plants, from 0/4 to 0/6 for
moderate water use plants and from 0.7 to 1.0 for high water use plants.
2. All water use features shall be included in the high water use hydrozone, and
temporarily irrigated areas shall be included in the low water use hydrozone.
3. All special landscape areas shall be identified and their water use calculated as
described below.
4. The ETAF for special landscape areas shall not excess 1.0.
C. The Maximum Applied Water Allowance (MAWA) shall be calculated using the
following equation: MAWA = (ETo)(0.62)[(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)] (ETo for
Kettleman is 60.18 inches per year (per www.cimis.water.ca.gov ETo zone map
dated 1999)).
The following calculations below are hypothetical to demonstrate proper use of the
equations and do not represent an existing and/or planned landscape project:
1. Example MAWA calculation: A hypothetical landscape project in Avenal with an
irrigated landscape area of 50,000 square feet without any Special Landscape Area
(SLA = 0, no edible plants, recreation areas or use or recycled water). To calculate
MAWA, the annual evapotranspiration (ETo) value for Kettleman is 60.18 inches
(per www.cimis.water.ca.gov ETo zone map dated 1999).
MAWA = (ETo)(0.62)[(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]
MAWA = Maximum Applied Water Allowance (gallons per year)
9.64-12
ETo = Annual Evapotranspiration (inches per year)
0.62 = Conversion Factor (to gallons)
0.7 = ET Adjusted Factor (ETAF)
LA = Landscape Area including SLA (square feet)
0.3 = Additional Water Allowance for SLA
SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet)
MAWA = (62.5 inches)(0.62)[(0.7 x 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 x 0)] = 1,356,250
gallons per year
To convert from gallons per year to hundred-cubic-feet per year:
= 1,356,250/748 = 1,813 hundred-cubic-feet per year (100 cubic feet = 748 gallons)
2. In this next hypothetical example, the landscape project in Avenal has the same ETo
of 62.5 inches per year (per www.cimiswaterca.gov ETo zone map dated 1999).and a
total landscape area of 50,000 square feet. Within the 50,000 square foot project,
there is now a 2,000 square foot area planted with edible plants. This 2,000 square
foot is considered to be a Special Landscape Area (SLA).
MAWA = (ETo)(0.62)[(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)]
MAWA = (62.5 inches) (0.62) [(0.7 x 50,000 square feet) + (0.3 x 2,000 square feet)]
= 38.75 x [35,000 + 600] gallons per year = 38.75 x 35,600 gallons per year = 1,
379,500 gallons per year or 1,844 hundred-cubic-feet per year
D. Estimated Total Water Use shall be calculated using the equation below. The sum
of the estimated total water use calculated for all hydrozones shall not exceed
MAWA.
ETWU = (ETo)(0.62) PFxHA + SLA
IE
Where:
ETWU= Estimated Total Water Use per year (gallons)
ETo = Annual Evapotranspiration (inches)
PF = Plant Factor from WUCOLS
HA = Hydrozone Area [high, medium and low water use areas] (square
feet)
SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet)
0.62 = Conversion Factor
IE = Irrigation Efficiency (minimum 0.71)
1. Example ETWU calculation: Landscape area is 50,000 square feet; plant water use
type, plant factor and hydrozone area are shown in the table below. The ETo value is
62.5 inches per year. There are no special landscape areas (recreational area, area
permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants, and area irrigated with recycled
water in this example.

Compare ETWU with MAWA: For this example, MAWA = (62.5)(0.62) [(0.7 x
50,000) + (0.3 x 0)] = 1,356,250 gallons per year. The ETWU (1,348,035 gallons per
year) is less than MAWA (1,356,250 gallons per year). In this example, the water
budget complies with the MAWA.
2. Example EETWU calculation: Total landscape area is 50,000 square feet, 2,000 square
feet of which is planted with edible plants. The edible plant area is considered a
Special Landscape Area (SLA). The evapotranspiration value is 62.5 inches per year.

Compare ETWU with MAWA: For this example, MAWA = (62.5)(0.62) [(0.7 x
50,000) + (0.3 x 2,000)] = 38.75 x [35,000 + 600] = 38.75 x 35,600 = 1,379,500 gallons
per year. The ETWU (1,360,047 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,379,500
gallons per year). For this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA.
9.64.09 SOIL MANAGEMENT REPORT. In order to reduce runoff and encourage healthy
plant growth, a soil management report shall be completed, after determination by the
Community Development Director, the Public Works Director or their designated
representative, that conditions warrant such testing.
A. Conditions which warrant the preparation of soil tests include, without limitation:

layers for new landscaping:
2. Suspected pervious land use conditions which could retard or complicate
desirable plant growth conditions.
Samples of the onsite soil shall be taken after completion of rough grading work and
all ancillary work that may cause compaction of the planting areas. The samples shall
be submitted to a certified soil testing laboratory for analysis. The soil samples shall

9.70.01 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish
procedures and general standards for the review and approval of Conditional

is listed in any Section of this Ordinance as a use permitted subject to securing a
CUP, it shall be approved only if it is consistent with the General Plan and meets
all requirements of this Ordinance and subject to any conditions deemed
appropriate by the decision making authority.
Conditional Use Permits are unique and their effect on the surrounding
environment can not be determined in advance of the use being proposed for a
particular location. At the time of application, a review of the location, design,
configuration, and potential impact of the proposed use shall be conducted by
comparing the use of the established development standards and design
guidelines. This review shall determine whether the proposed use should be
permitted by weighing the public need for and the benefit to be derived from the
use against the impact which it may cause.
9.70.02 APPLICATION CONTENTS. An application for a CUP shall include the
following:
A. Name and address of applicant.
B. Name(s) and address(es) of the property owner(s).

information:
9.70-2
1. Location of all existing buildings, structures, and improvements on the
property.
2. Location, size, height, and proposed use of all proposed buildings,
structures, and improvements on the property.
3. Existing and proposed streets and highways bordering and within the
boundaries of the property.
4. Location (and dimensions) of existing and proposed parking areas,
lighting, signs, walls or fences.
5. Proposed landscaping.
6. North arrow.
E. Elevations of proposed buildings or structures related to the CUP.

of this Ordinance under which the CUP is requested.
3. Reasons applicant feels justified in the granting of the CUP.
G. Application processing fees as adopted by the City Council.
9.70.03 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES. Verification: the Community
Development Director City Manager shall verify the accuracy and completeness

NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, USES, LOTS, AND SIGNS
Sections:
9.74.01 PURPOSE & APPLICATION
9.74.02 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
9.74.03 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES
9.74.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
9.74.05 NONCONFORMING LOTS
9.74.06 DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS
9.74.07 EXISTING CONDITIONAL USES
9.74.01 PURPOSE & APPLICATION. This section is intended to limit the number and
extent of nonconforming uses by prohibiting their enlargement, reestablishment
after abandonment, and restoration and destruction. Within the zoning districts
established by this Ordinance, or as subsequently amended, there exist structures,
uses, lots, and signs which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or
amended but which would be prohibited or restricted under the conditions of this
Ordinance or future amendments. The City Council of Avenal declares that
nonconforming structures, uses, lots, and signs are incompatible with permitted uses
in the zoning districts involved and such nonconforming uses, lots, and signs shall
not be enlarged, expanded, or extended. Such nonconforming structures, uses, lots
and signs shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
by this Ordinance.
9.74.02 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
A. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged in area, space, or volume that
will result in an increase in the degree of nonconformity.
9.74.03 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
A. Any nonconforming use may be maintained and continued provided there is no
increase or enlargement of the area, space, volume occupied, use or trips
generated by the facility to such nonconforming use, except as otherwise
provided in this Ordinance. Keeping of household pets/animals may not be
maintained and continued contrary to the provisions of this ordinance.
B. Any part of a permanent building, structure, or land occupied by a
nonconforming use that is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the
provisions of this Ordinance shall not thereafter be used or occupied by a
nonconforming use.
9.74-2
C. Any part of a building, structure, or land occupied by a nonconforming use that
has been abandoned for a period of one (1) year or more shall not again be used
or occupied for a nonconforming use.
D. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be
changed to a similar or less intense nonconforming use.
E. Whenever a nonconforming non-residential use or structure shall be destroyed
by fire or other calamity, by an act of God, or by the public enemy to the extent
of less than sixty (60) percent, the structure may be restored and the
nonconforming use may be resumed, provided that restoration is started within
six (6) months and diligently pursued to completion. The use must also have a
pre-inspection before utilities can be turned out. Whenever a nonconforming
use or structure is so destroyed or damaged to the extent of sixty (60) percent, or
more, or is razed, either voluntarily or as required by law, the structure shall not
be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the district in
which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. However,
this does not apply to residential structures which can be rebuilt in all zones if
they burn more than sixty percent (60%). The extent of damage to any structure
or use shall be as determined by the building official.
9.74.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
A. A nonconforming use of land shall not be expanded or extended in any way.
B. A nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to or replaced by any other
use except a use that complies with the regulations of the zoning district in
which the subject property lies.
C. Any nonconforming use of land that has been abandoned for a period of one (1)
year or more shall not be reestablished.
D. Any nonconforming uses of land where no main building has been established
or a nonconforming use occupying a structure having an assessed valuation of
less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00); or a nonconforming sign or
outdoor advertising structure; or a nonconforming sign intruding into the public
right-of-way shall be completely removed upon the effective date of the
ordinance certified in this Section and shall be discontinued within three (3)
years of the effective date of this Section.
1. Other nonconforming uses and structures shall be completely removed or
altered and converted to a conforming status in accordance with the following
schedule:
Type of Construction (Uniform Building Code, 1961 Edition): Type I and II;
time period, forty (40) years;
9.74-3

IV; time period, thirty (30) years;
Type of Construction (Uniform Building Code, 1961 Edition): Type V; time
period, twenty-five (25) years;
Fences, hedges and walls: time period, six (6) months.
2. When such nonconforming use is removed, at or before the end of the
specified time period, every future use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this title. Repairs necessary to maintain a nonconforming use,
and minor alterations not exceeding an assessed valuation of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) shall not be construed as lengthening the allowed time
period for compliance.
3. The time period shall begin on the date the use first became nonconforming
on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
Whenever a use or structure becomes nonconforming because of a change of
zoning district boundaries or a change of regulations for the district in which
the site is located, the period of time prescribed shall be computed from the
effective date of the change of district or regulations.
4. Records and Notification of Nonconforming Uses and Structures. Within six
(6) months after the effective date of said ordinance and amendments thereto,
the responsible official shall compile a list and description of all structures or
uses which shall have become nonconforming by the adoption of said
ordinance or amendments. This list shall be recorded in the office of the
Kings County recorder.
5. Within one (1) year after the effective date of said ordinance or amendments
thereto, the Community Development Director shall notify in writing the
owners of all nonconforming structures or uses of the nonconforming status of
their property and the date when such structure or use shall be removed or
made conforming by said owners, if such removal for conformance is required
by the provisions of this title.
6. Continuing Nonconforming Uses or Structures. Nothing in this title shall be
construed to exempt a use or structure which became nonconforming under
the provisions of a previous ordinance and which continues to be
nonconforming under the provisions of this title. Such continuing
nonconforming uses or structures shall be discontinued or eliminated within
the schedule and under the provisions of the ordinance in force when they first
became nonconforming or within the schedule and under the provisions of this
title from the date of its enactment, whichever is more restrictive.
9.74-4
7. Nonconforming Yards. Existing structures which are nonconforming solely
because of the lack of required yards but which are within sixty (60) percent
of conformance shall be exempted from this section and shall be exempted
from making alterations to improve the existing structure, but shall otherwise
be subject to the provisions governing nonconforming structures.
E. The exploration for or development or production of oil, gas, or other
hydrocarbon substances shall not be considered nonconforming uses of land.
9.74.05 NONCONFORMING LOTS. Any lot which was legally recorded prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance may be used in conformance with the uses
permitted by the zoning district in which it is located, provided that all other Zoning
Ordinance and General Plan requirements are met.
9.74.06 DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS. Where there is doubt
regarding the legal nonconforming status of structures, uses of structures, uses of
land, parcel size, or signs, documentation shall be submitted to the Community
Development Director to establish legal nonconforming status.
9.74.07 EXISTING CONDITIONAL USES. Any existing structure or use which is a
conditional use in the district in which it is located shall be considered as a
permitted use for the purposes of this title; provided, however, that any expansion,
alteration or change of such use or structure shall be subject to approval of the
Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions prescribed in Chapter 9.70.
