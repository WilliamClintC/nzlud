PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Huntsville, Alabama. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, which embraced ordinances adopted through February 12, 1981 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 2-151. - Investment policy. 
(a)  Generally. It is the policy of the city to invest city funds in a manner which will ensure maximum security with sufficient liquidity to meet daily cash flow demands while providing the highest investment return on municipal funds. The investment of all city funds is the responsibility of the finance department. The director of finance and employees whom he may designate are authorized to invest city funds consistent with this policy. The city clerk-treasurer, in fulfilling the duties of his office, shall participate in the implementation of this section and in the obtaining of the objectives listed in this section. 
(b)  Scope. 
(1)  Pursuant to Code of Ala. 1975, Sec. 11-81-1911-81-21, this section applies to all municipal funds of the city. 
(2)  This section applies to all transactions involving the financial assets and related activities of all municipal funds of the city. 
(c)  Objectives. 
(1)  Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment policy of the city. Investment transactions shall seek to avoid capital losses, whether they be from security defaults or erosion of market value. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, the city shall diversify its portfolio to avoid incurring unreasonable risks inherent in overinvesting in specific instruments, individual financial institutions or investments with similar maturities. 
(2)  Another objective is that the city's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. An additional objective is to attain a maximum investment yield on available funds taking into account the city's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 
(d)  Authority, prudence and ethics. 
(1)  Management responsibility for the investment program is delegated to the director of finance, who, along with the city clerk-treasurer, shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for transactions. No person shall engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this section and the procedures established under this section. The director of finance shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate investment activities of officials with responsibilities under this section. 
(2)  Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for any change in an individual security's credit risk or market price, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
(3)  Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Full disclosure shall be made by officers and employees who may have material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the city, and they shall further disclose any large personal investments or financial activities that could be related to the performance of the city's portfolio. 
(e)  Internal controls and reporting requirements. The director of finance shall establish a system of internal control designated to prevent losses of public funds arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets, or imprudent actions by employees and officers of the city. Annually, the director of finance and the city clerk-treasurer shall publish a comprehensive report on the investment program and investment activity. The annual report shall include a comparison of investment returns and may recommend policies and improvements that might be made in the investment program. 
(f)  Instruments, maturities and risks. 
(1)  The city may invest municipal funds in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, Title 11. 
(2)  It is the policy of the city to diversify its investment portfolio to minimize the risk of loss resulting from over-investing funds in a specific maturity, a specific financial institution or a specific class of security instruments. With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities, no more than 50 percent of the city's investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type or with a single financial institution. Investments of the city shall be made in instruments whose maturities do not exceed five years. In order to ensure adequate liquidity without market risk, investments shall have maturity dates at or prior to the time cash is prudently projected to be required to meet disbursement needs. 
(g)  Collateralization, safekeeping and custody. 
(1)  It is the city's policy that any bank or financial institution in the State of Alabama that invest city municipal funds shall be a Qualified Public Depository certified by the Alabama State Treasurer according to the Security for Alabama Funds Enhancement Act (SAFE Act), Section 41-14A-1, et seq., Code of Alabama 1975, as amended from time to time. 
(2)  All amounts of deposit made and certificate of deposits (CDs) issued in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC and FSLIC shall be collateralized with securities of the United States government, federal agencies which represent the full faith and credit of the United States, or otherwise authorized by state law. The collateral for each deposit or certificate of deposit shall have a market value equal to at least 100 percent of the excess of amounts insured by the FDIC and FSLIC. 
(3)  It is the policy of the city to require from each authorized financial institution holding city funds a listing of securities pledged as collateral to protect the city's investment. This listing of collateral shall be provided to the city by each institution for deposits held on June 30 and December 31 of each year. All investment securities purchased by the city and all collateral on deposits of the city shall be held in a custodian account maintained by a trust department of a bank insured by the FDIC, in the Federal Reserve Bank or by the city. The trust department shall issue a safekeeping receipt to the city listing the specific instrument, rate of return, maturity date and other pertinent information. 
(h)  Authorized financial institutions. 
(1)  The city clerk-treasurer shall maintain the list of approved banks or financial institutions for investment purposes that have offices located in the city. 
(2)  Before accepting funds or engaging in investment transactions with the city, the supervising officer at each institution shall submit a certification that the officer has reviewed this section and agrees to disclose potential conflicts or risks to public funds that might arise out of business transactions between the institution and the city. All financial institutions shall agree to undertake reasonable efforts to preclude imprudent transactions involving city funds.

(b)  No real property owned by the city and administered by a general fund department of the city shall be advertised or offered for sale on behalf of the city, and no negotiations concerning the disposition of any such property shall occur by any officer or agent of the city until such property has been declared surplus by appropriate ordinance or resolution duly adopted by the city council. 
(c)  Upon any declaration by the city council that any real property owned by the city and described in subsection (b) of this section is surplus to the needs of the city, the council shall first proceed to make certain findings as follows: 
(1)  The council shall first determine that the property is not needed by some other department or division of the city. If the property is not needed by any general fund department of the city and not needed by any other board or division of the city, the council shall determine if an accurate survey and description is available with respect to the property. If an accurate survey and description of the property is not available, the director of finance shall be authorized to have a survey and description prepared by an engineer or land surveyor. 
(2)  If the property is suitable for subdivision or development, the director of finance shall be authorized to determine whether or not the property should be subdivided and public improvements installed prior to being offered for sale. If the council elects to subdivide and install improvements prior to sale, the mayor and director of finance shall be authorized to employ an engineer to develop a plan for the subdivision of the property and for the installation of improvements upon the property. No plan for subdivision of the property will be authorized by the council except upon approval of the plan by the planning commission of the city and subject to filing of the plat in the office of the judge of probate of the county. Division of any property owned by the city into two or more parts or parcels for the purpose of sale or development shall be considered a subdivision. 
(3)  If the property is not suitable for development, but would only be useful to an adjoining owner to use in conjunction with adjacent and adjoining property, all adjoining owners shall be requested in writing to acknowledge in writing whether or not they have an interest in purchasing the property for such use. If the owners of adjacent property are interested in purchase, the director of finance shall invite bids from all such interested persons to be opened by the director and presented to the council. 
(4)  If the property is suitable for development, the property shall be advertised as provided in this section. 
(5)  No property shall be sold by the council until an appraisal has been received by the council, either from an independent appraiser employed by the mayor or from a staff appraiser of the city, as the council may elect; however, no such appraisal shall be made public until after bids have been received by the director of finance. 
(6)  Property suitable for subdivision or development shall be sold only after a suitable notice with respect to the proposed sale has been placed by the director of finance in a newspaper having general circulation within the city, the advertisement to appear at least ten days prior to the time announced for the receipt of bids. The council may determine, prior to any advertisement, that the property will not be sold for less than an established price, in which case such minimum price shall be referred to in the advertisement. Prior to the publication of any notice to advertise any such property for sale, the director of finance shall consult with appropriate city departments to determine the need for the reservation of any rights-of-way or easements with respect to the property. Sale may be by public bid or by public auction. The council shall not be obligated to accept any bid, either at an advertised sale or auction, unless such fact is referred to in the notice. 
(d)  The director of the public works services department shall, upon completion of any street improvement project, report any remnants or surplus property to the council for disposition. 
(e)  Upon approval by the council for sale of any property declared surplus as provided in this section, the mayor shall proceed to deliver a deed to the property in accordance with the authorization by the council; and the proceeds shall be delivered to the city clerk-treasurer. 
(f)  This section shall not apply to the disposition of industrial or research park property or to the disposition of any property for which a disposition procedure has been or is otherwise determined by the council.

Sec. 2-158. - Payment by credit card. 
(a)  Any office, department, agency, board or commission of the city is authorized to accept payment by credit card, charge card and debit card issued by any bank, foreign lender, domestic lender or credit card bank as defined in the Alabama Credit Card Act, sections 5-20-2 through 5-20-16, Code of Ala. 1975.

(c)  With the approval of the city council, the mayor is authorized to enter into appropriate agreements with one or more credit card issuers or other appropriate parties as needed to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payment.

(d)  No person making payment by credit card shall be relieved of liability for the face amount of the payment except to the extent that the city realizes full and final payment of the underlying obligation in cash or its equivalent. If full and final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation shall survive and the city shall retain all remedies for enforcement which would have applied if the credit card transaction had not occurred. 
(e)  A city employee who accepts a credit card payment in accordance with this section and any applicable policy, rule or regulation of the city shall not thereby incur any personal liability for the final collection of such payments. 
(f)  The clerk-treasurer is authorized to establish policies, rules and regulations governing the acceptance of payment for municipal services by credit card and to disseminate them to all employees. 
( Ord. No. 13-844, 11-7-2013 )  
Sec. 2-159. - [Debt management policy.] 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The city recognizes the foundation of any well-managed debt program is a comprehensive debt management policy. A debt management policy sets forth the parameters for issuing debt and managing the outstanding debt portfolio of the city, and provides guidance to decision makers regarding the purposes for which debt may be issued, types and amounts of permissible debt, timing and method of sale that may be used, and structural features that may be incorporated. Adherence to a debt management policy helps to ensure that government maintains a sound debt position and that credit quality is protected. 
(2)  This debt management policy will help: 
a.  Promote high quality debt management decisions; 
b.  Maintain order and discipline throughout the debt issuance process; 
c.  Promote consistency and continuity in the decision making process; 
d.  Demonstrate a commitment to long-term financial planning objectives; and 
e.  Ensure that debt management decisions are viewed positively by rating agencies and the investment community and by citizens of the city. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Build America Bonds or BABs means the same as the term "Build America Bonds" as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and shall include Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds issued under Section 1400U-2 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
City clerk-treasurer means the person holding the title of city clerk-treasurer of the city or, if the city shall determine to vest primary responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of this policy charged to the city clerk-treasurer in another officer of the city, then from such date the terms shall be interpreted to mean such other officer of the city. 
Finance director means the person holding the title of director of finance of the city or, if the city shall determine to vest primary responsibility for the enforcement of this policy in another officer of the city, then from such date the terms shall be interpreted to mean such other officer of the city. 
Internal Revenue Code means of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
IRS means the United States Internal Revenue Service. 
Policy means the debt management policy prescribed by this section. 
Ten-year capital improvement plan means the long-range plan for expanding and maintaining the city's capital infrastructure as adopted by city council resolution from time to time. 
(c)  Implementation. The policy shall be implemented by the mayor and finance director as authorized by the city council. Comprehensive debt management guidelines shall provide for the following: 
(1)  Full and timely payment of principal and interest on all outstanding debt. 
(2)  Debt shall be incurred only for those purposes as provided by applicable state law. 
(3)  Capital improvements should be planned, approved and financed in accordance with city ordinances and (with the exception of unanticipated extraordinary capital improvements) the ten-year capital improvement plan development process and/or other long-term capital planning models of the city. 
(4)  The payment of debt shall be secured by the full faith and credit of the city, in the case of general obligation bonds or warrants, and by the pledge of specified, limited revenues in the case of revenue bonds and warrants. The city shall not pledge any city revenues to debt issued by conduit entities formed within the city. The city shall have no moral obligation to repay the holders of debt issued by conduit issuers or other public entities within the city. 
(5)  Principal and interest retirement schedules shall be structured to: 
a.  Achieve a low borrowing cost for the city; 
b.  Accommodate the debt service payments of existing debt; and 
c.  Respond to perceptions of market demand. 
Shorter maturities shall always be encouraged to demonstrate to rating agencies that debt is being retired at a sufficient pace. 
(6)  Debt issued shall generally be limited to obligations with serial and term maturities but may be sold in the form of capital appreciation obligations or other structures if circumstances warrant. 
(7)  The average life of the debt incurred should be no greater than the projected average life of the assets being financed. 
(8)  The city shall select a method of debt sale that shall maximize the financial benefit to the city. Such sales can be competitive or negotiated, depending upon the project and market conditions. All methods of sale shall be subject to council approval. 
(9)  The city shall maintain good communications with credit rating agencies to ensure complete and clear understanding of the creditworthiness of the city. 
(10)  Every financial report, official statement/offering circular, and annual information statement shall follow a policy of accurate disclosure of financial conditions and operating results. All financial reports and annual information statements shall conform to guidelines issued by the Government Finance Officers Association, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB"), and the Securities and Exchange Commission to meet the disclosure needs of rating agencies, underwriters, investors and citizens. 
(d)  Debt limitations. 
(1)  Legal limitations. All debt issuances will be accomplished in compliance with applicable federal regulations, the Alabama Constitution, applicable state statutes, city ordinances, and all other applicable legal constraints. 
(2)  Public policy limitations. 
a.  The city shall assess all financial alternatives for funding capital improvements prior to issuing debt. Pay-as-you-go financing should be considered before issuing any debt. Pay-as-you-go financing may include: intergovernmental grants from federal, state, and other sources; current revenues and financial balances; public/private partnerships; and lease payments. Once the city has determined that "pay-as-you-go" is not a feasible financing option, the city may use short-term or long-term debt to finance capital projects. 
b.  All capital improvements and financings for capital improvements (with the exception of unanticipated extraordinary capital improvement requirements) will be made in accordance with an adopted ten-year capital improvement plan and/or other long-term capital planning models of the city. 
c.  General obligation warrants will be used to finance only those capital projects or improvements that have been determined to be essential to the maintenance or development of the city. Debt may be issued to finance long-term capital improvements, economic development initiatives, other property and equipment used in the furtherance of the mission of the city and for public improvements related to the quality of life of the citizens of the city. The city will not issue debt for the purpose of funding short-term assets with useful lives of less than three years. 
d.  Capital projects financed through the issuance of debt shall be financed over a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the project financed. 
e.  Long-term debt will only be used for capital projects that feasibly cannot be financed from current revenue sources, in conjunction with the ten-year capital improvement plan and/or other long-term capital planning models of the city. 
f.  Current operations will not be funded from the proceeds of borrowed funds. 
g.  In general, the city will limit the term of its tax-supported debt to 20 years, arranging for the repayment of long-term debt on a level-payment basis, unless special circumstances dictate otherwise, in which case the special circumstances will be disclosed in the associated financing plans, and as otherwise specified herein. 
(3)  Financial limitations. 
a.  The city will strive to maintain the highest debt service coverage ratios practicable consistent with its long-term financial objectives. 
b.  The city will closely monitor the absolute amounts and year-to-year trends of key financial ratios. The city recognizes that specific ratios, in and of themselves, may or may not depict an accurate assessment of the financial health of the city and may be affected temporarily by national or local economic conditions. It also recognizes, however, that negative trends for an extended period over multiple years are signals that must not be overlooked and will become a part of the annual reporting process of the finance department to the mayor and city council. Ratios to be monitored consist of the following: 
1.  General obligation debt as a percent of actual market value of property; 
2.  Debt per capita; 
3.  Debt service as a percent of general governmental expenditures; 
4.  Percent of total debt to be retired after ten years; and 
5.  Unreserved and undesignated general fund balance as a percent of general fund revenue. 
c.  Revenue debt levels will be monitored periodically and evaluated in terms of other debt service coverage ratios, trends in those ratios, and against covenants contained within the applicable financing documents. 
d.  The city recognizes the potential contingent impact that poorly conceived or structured debt sold by conduit issuers incorporated within the city can have on the reputation of the city and the marketability of its debt. When entertaining a petition to authorize the formation of any conduit issuer the city shall undertake to impose certain minimum standards respecting debt issued by such entity including, without limitation, minimal credit ratings and/or levels of collateral securing the debt and limitations, the purposes for which such debt may be issued and requirements on the types of purchasers to which the debt may be marketed. With respect to hospital/medical authorities and boards, entities formed under Code of Ala. 1975, tit. 11, ch. 99A or ch. 99B, and certain other special purpose public entities, the name of the city shall not be used in the title of such issuer unless required by state law and no information respecting the city may be used in any debt offering materials circulated by such entity absent an express disclaimer in such materials that the information is being provided for information purposes only about the city and that the city has no obligation, legal, moral or otherwise, for the repayment of such debt. 
e.  The authorizing proceedings for any short-term obligations issued by the city shall describe the purpose of the proposed debt, the circumstances under which it is being issued, and the term and size limitations thereof. 
(e)  Use of derivatives. 
(1)  The city recognizes that, while generally not utilized by the city, in certain circumstances interest rate swaps and other derivatives can be appropriate interest rate management tools and when properly utilized can increase the city's financial flexibility and provide opportunities for interest rate savings or reduced risks. Derivatives should be addressed in the city's overall debt and investment management policies. 
(2)  Swaps and other derivatives will not be used for speculation. For purposes of this policy, speculation means taking additional risks, unrelated to the city's business, in an effort to increase returns. The city will follow rules and processes similar to those the city would follow when evaluating the suitability of any significant investment. 
(3)  Swaps and other derivatives may be used when they achieve a specific objective consistent with the city's overall debt and investment management policies. Swaps and other derivatives may be used, for example, to lock-in a current market fixed rate or, alternatively, to create advantages through creating exposure to variable rates of interest. Swaps and other derivatives may be used to produce interest rate savings, alter the pattern of debt service payments, and cap, limit, or hedge variable rate payments. The city will only enter into swaps and other derivatives in accordance with the requirements of applicable state law. 
(4)  Reasons to use interest rate swaps, swaptions and other derivatives include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Reducing interest expense; 
b.  Hedging and actively managing interest rate, basis, and other risks; 
c.  Optimizing capital structure (e.g., to achieve targeted debt allocation); and 
d.  Achieving appropriate asset/liability match. 
(5)  The city will evaluate this use of derivatives subsection at least annually based on current market practices and credit concerns. 
(f)  Debt structuring practices. 
(1)  In general, the city will limit the term of its tax-supported debt to 20 years, arranging for the repayment of long-term debt on a level-payment basis, unless special circumstances dictate otherwise, in which case the special circumstances will be disclosed in the associated financing plans, and as otherwise specified herein. 
(2)  Revenue debt, or supporting debt, likewise will not exceed the useful life of the assets being financed but may be structured for a longer term than the city's tax-supported debt. 
(3)  The city will structure repayments of debt so as to recapture as rapidly as possible the credit capacity of the city for future needs. 
(4)  The city may choose to structure debt repayment so as to wrap-around existing obligations or to achieve other financial policy goals. 
(5)  Redemption features of city debt - mandatory, special and optional - shall be incorporated into debt issued by the city based on the specific needs of the city and then-current market conditions. 
(6)  In general, the city will issue fixed-rate debt and will not utilize variable rate debt or derivatives such as swaps or swaptions as financing vehicles. Provided, however, the city may use variable rate debt for short-term financings (i.e., financings for a period of less than three years) and specific projects that would benefit from a variable rate structure or that may require optional redemption provisions that are not available through a traditional fixed rate financing. 
(7)  Other structuring practices. 
a.  Capitalized interest will not be utilized for general obligation debt. Capitalized interest may be used on a limited basis with revenue/self-supported debt during the construction process and for that period of time when revenues for the financed project are developing consistent with federal tax laws. 
b.  Principal deferrals may be utilized on a limited basis during the construction of the project for a revenue/self-supported project or during an initial period of time during which revenues, such as from the establishment of a tax increment finance district, are realized. Otherwise, other than in connection with creating a "wrap-around" debt structure, principal deferrals will be discouraged. 
c.  The city shall use such other practices as it deems necessary and appropriate to obtain the lowest overall financing costs for the city over the term of the financing. For example, credit enhancement vehicles may be utilized, such as bond insurance or letters of credit from suitably rated banks, may be used provided that a present value benefit is produced when compared to issuing the debt without such credit enhancement. In the event credit enhancement is not cost effective, the city may still utilize credit enhancement subject to a finding by the finance director that determines that such enhancement meets the city's financing goals and objectives. 
(g)  Debt issuance practices. 
(1)  Method of sale. The city may elect to sell debt through a negotiated or competitive sale, or by a process that utilizes requests for proposals from financial institutions to purchase the debt. The method selected by the city for the sale of its obligations will depend on various factors including, but not limited to, the size and complexity of the transaction, current market conditions and other factors applicable to the city at the time of sale. The determination of which method of sale to follow will be made on either an issue by issue basis, for a series of issues or for a part of a specific financing program. 
(2)  Refunding criteria. 
a.  The city may advance refund outstanding obligations when advantageous, legally permissible, and when net present value savings equal or exceed the greater of $200,000.00 or four percent. Exceptions may be made only upon the recommendation of the finance director and the approval of the mayor and city council. 
b.  The city may currently refund outstanding obligations when advantageous, legally permissible, and when net present value savings equal or exceed the greater of $200,000.00 or three percent. Exceptions may be made only upon the recommendation of the finance director and the approval of the mayor and city council. 
c.  The provisions of the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. notwithstanding, the city may choose to refund debt, on either an advance or current basis, without regard to the net present value test, when the existing financial structure or bond covenants impinge on prudent and sound financial management. In such a case, the restructuring is subject to a finding by the finance director that the restructuring is in the overall best interests of the city. 
d.  The principal maturity schedule of refinancing debt will be structured as to generally conform to the schedule of the refinanced debt, unless special circumstances dictate otherwise, in which case the special circumstances will be disclosed in the associated refinancing plan. Savings the city may realize in such refinancing may be realized in the form of an up-front payment or through a reduction in debt service payments, or a combination of both, based on the city's best interest and requirements. 
(3)  Selection and use of financial providers. The city's finance director shall be responsible for the selection process for securing professional services that are required to develop, monitor, and implement the city's debt management program. Consultants providing advice or counsel to the city shall be independent. The financial advisor, bond counsel, and underwriter for any issuance of debt shall be separate entities having no relationship with one another. 
a.  The finance director will request the recommendation of the city attorney in selecting bond counsel which will also be approved by the mayor and city council. Bond counsel will be from a nationally recognized firm with significant experience in tax matters and legal requirements associated with the sale of governmental debt. 
b.  The financial advisor will be selected based upon the recommendation of the finance director to the mayor and city council. The financial advisor will be from a regionally or nationally recognized firm with experience in the capital planning, structuring and sale of governmental debt. Any financial advisor utilized by the city also capable of providing underwriting services shall be prohibited from participating in the underwriting of any debt for the city for a period of one year from the date of termination of its contract for financial advisory services. 
c.  Underwriters will be selected based upon the recommendation of the finance director to the mayor and city council. The underwriters shall be regionally or nationally recognized with demonstrated experience in the underwriting of governmental debt. 
d.  Other services providers, such as paying agents, escrow agents, verification agents, and trustees will also be selected based upon the recommendation of the finance director to the mayor and city council. 
(h)  Debt management practices. 
(1)  Arbitrage rebate monitoring and filing. The city shall minimize the cost of arbitrage rebate and yield restriction while strictly complying with federal and state law. 
a.  The city shall maintain investment allocations by source of funds and record pro rata interest income of the commingled bond funds monthly. 
b.  Project cash flows shall be carefully planned to insure the applicability of rebate exceptions, if feasible. 
c.  Rebate computations should be performed annually, but no less often than every five years until the obligations mature. 
d.  It is the city's policy to segregate current arbitrage earnings for future payment or credit, and to enter the amount as a liability on the books. 
e.  The city shall report to the IRS as required and shall make rebate payments as required by federal law. 
f.  The city shall structure its financings in such a way as to reduce or eliminate future arbitrage rebate liability, wherever feasible. 
(2)  Federal and state loan compliance practicesContinuing disclosure. The finance director will be responsible for providing ongoing disclosure information through Electronic Municipal Markets Access System ("EMMA") (or any such other system subsequently authorized by the MSRB or the SEC) and for maintaining compliance with disclosure standards promulgated by state and national regulatory bodies. The finance director will consult with the city's financial advisors and bond counsel in meeting the city's continuing disclosure and other compliance obligations. The city will conduct an annual review of all of the continuing disclosure requirements outlined in each financing and provide certifications and additional information as appropriate. 
(3)  Market and investor relations efforts. The finance director, in conjunction with the city's financial advisor, will maintain on-going contact with and supply information to the rating agencies and through its continuing disclosure obligations. The city will provide full and prompt disclosure of all material events through the national reporting system and will respond to inquiries and questions from the underwriting and investor communities as appropriate. 
(4)  Investment of proceeds of city debt. 
a.  The investment of all public funds is subject to certain state restrictions in addition to any restrictions contained within the warrant ordinance or other financing documents. 
b.  The city clerk-treasurer will be responsible for the investment of proceeds of all tax-exempt obligations and obligations issued as BABs. 
c.  The city clerk-treasurer will consult with the finance director, when appropriate, the city's financial advisor and other deputies of the city, to determine projected spend-down schedules in order to determine the optimum investment for the city of debt proceeds consistent with the Internal Revenue Code. 
(i)  Compliance procedure and policy for tax-exempt governmental obligations and Build America Bonds. 
(1)  Purpose and need for policy. To help ensure that the city takes all actions reasonably necessary to ensure the continuing tax-exempt status of its governmental obligations (and the continuing eligibility for the receipt of direct payments from the federal government respecting obligations issued as Build America Bonds), the city council has adopted this subsection to address conformance to applicable IRS post-issuance compliance requirements for tax-exempt governmental obligations, and obligations intended to be treated as Build America Bonds, issued by the city. 
This policy documents existing practices and describes various procedures and systems designed to identify on a timely basis facts relevant to demonstrating compliance with the requirements that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of tax-exempt governmental obligations in order that the interest on such obligations be, or continue to be, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and obligations issued as BABs in order that such obligations be, and continue to be, treated as "Build America Bonds" for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(2)  Policy. As a present or intended issuer of tax-exempt governmental obligations and BABs, the city is required by the terms of Sections 103 and 141-150 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), to take certain actions subsequent to the issuance of such obligations to ensure the continuing tax-exempt status of such obligations and to take actions to ensure continued eligibility for interest subsidy payments in connection with BABs. Additionally, Section 6001 of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 1.6001-1(a) of the Treasury Regulations impose record retention requirements on the city with respect to its tax-exempt governmental obligations and BABs. This subsection "Compliance Procedure and Policy for Tax-Exempt Governmental Obligations and Build America Bonds" is to help facilitate the efforts of the city in complying with the city's compliance obligations under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations. 
a.  Responsible parties. The city clerk-treasurer shall be the party primarily responsible for implementing and monitoring the city's compliance requirements under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations as they pertain to the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt obligations and BABs issued by the city. The finance director shall be the party primarily responsible for monitoring the city's compliance requirements with respect to all other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations. Each of the city clerk-treasurer and finance directors will be assisted by the staff of said officer and by other city staff and officials when appropriate. Such officers will also be assisted in carrying out post-issuance compliance requirements by the following: 
1.  Bond counsel (the law firm primarily responsible for providing bond counsel services for the city); 
2.  Financial advisor (the entity primarily responsible for providing financial advisor services to the city); 
3.  Paying agent (the person(s), entity (entities), or city officer(s) primarily responsible for providing paying agent services for the city); and 
4.  Rebate analyst (the entity (entities) primarily responsible for providing rebate analyst services for the city). 
With respect to the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt obligations and BABs, the city clerk-treasurer shall be responsible for assigning compliance responsibilities to members of such officer's staff, other staff of the city, the financial advisor, bond counsel, the paying agent, and the rebate analyst as the city clerk-treasurer deems appropriate. For all other purposes of this policy the finance director shall be responsible for assigning compliance responsibilities to members of such officer's staff, other staff of the city, the financial advisor, bond counsel, the paying agent, and the rebate analyst as the finance director deems appropriate. Each of the city clerk-treasurer and finance directors shall utilize such other professional service organizations as are necessary to ensure compliance by the city with this policy. 
b.  Special pre-issuance and post-issuance policies respecting BABs. In connection with the issuance and sale of each series of BABs by the city, the finance director shall: 
1.  Consult with the Financial Advisor on methods to help ensure that no maturities of any direct pay BABs are issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue premium including, without limitation, (i) negotiating terms in the purchase contract or such other commitment or agreements between the city and the underwriter(s) or purchaser(s) that expressly prohibit any maturities from having beyond a de minimis amount of original issue premium; (ii) negotiating with the underwriter(s) or purchaser(s) of such obligations to minimize to the extent feasible and practicable the number of days between the sale date and the date such obligations are issued and delivered; (iii) obtaining from the underwriter(s) or purchaser(s) of such obligations a certificate representing the issue price thereof; and (iv) negotiating such other provisions as the financial advisor may advise in order to minimize or prevent any such original issue premium.

3.  For each issue of BABs, the finance director shall file with the IRS, no earlier than 90 days nor later than 45 days before each interest payment date, Form 8038-CP to ensure payment of the BABs direct federal payment (the finance director may contract, on behalf of the city, with the paying agent or such other consultant as identified by the finance director to make such filings);

f.  Reissuance. The following policies relate to compliance with rules and regulations regarding the reissuance of obligations for federal law purposes. The finance director will: 
1.  Identify and consult with bond counsel regarding any post-issuance change to any terms of an issue of tax-exempt obligations or BABs which could potentially be treated as a reissuance for federal tax purposes; and 
2.  Confirm with bond counsel whether any "remedial action" in connection with a "change in use" (as such terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations) would be treated as a reissuance for tax purposes and, if so, confirm the filing of any new IRS Form 8038-G. 
g.  Other post-issuance actions. If, in consultation with the mayor, the city council, the financial advisor, bond counsel, the paying agent, the rebate analyst, the city clerk, the city attorney, or any other city officials or relevant advisors the finance director determines that any additional action not identified in this policy must be taken to continue the tax-exempt status of any issue of governmental obligations of the city (or the status of obligations issued as BABs), the finance director shall take such action if the finance director has the authority to do so. If, after consultation with the mayor, the city council, the financial advisor, bond counsel, the paying agent, the rebate analyst, the city clerk, the city attorney, or any other city officials or relevant advisors the finance director determines that this policy must be amended or supplemented to continue the tax-exempt status of any issue of governmental obligations of the city (or the status of obligations issued as BABs), the finance director shall recommend to the city council that this policy be so amended or supplemented. 
(3)  Responsibility. Enforcement of this subsection with respect to the investment of proceeds of tax-exempt obligations and BABs shall be the primary responsibility of the city clerk-treasurer and, with respect to all other matters, shall be the primary responsibility of the finance director, although each of the city clerk-treasurer and finance director may delegate, as such officer deems reasonable or necessary, and or all such functions to staff within the office of the finance director, or to the financial advisor, bond counsel, the paying agent or rebate analyst.

(1)  Public notice. Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time prior to the date set forth for the opening of the bids.

Any bid determined to be nonresponsive to the requirements will be rejected. 
(5)  Correction or withdrawal of bids; cancellation of awards. Corrections or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received by procurement services prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition shall be permitted except as authorized by Code of Ala. 1975, tits. 39 and 41 (Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 39-1-1 et seq., 41-1-1 et seq.). 
(6)  Resident responsible bidder.

For the purposes of this section, the term "resident bidder" shall be defined in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 41-16-50. 
(7)  Determination of nonresponsibility. If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by procurement services.

(8)  Award. Upon the approval of the city council, contracts shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.

(c)  Specifications. All specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the city's needs, and shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy as set forth in this section applies to all specifications and empowers procurement services to approve or disapprove all specifications, including but not limited to those prepared for the city by architects, engineers, designers and draftsmen. 
(1)  Brand name or equal specification. Brand name or equal specifications may be used when procurement services determines in writing that: 
a.  No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available; 
b.  Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not including a brand name specification; 
c.  The nature of the product or the nature of the city's requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement; or 
d.  Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the city's best interests. 
(2)  Required characteristics. Unless procurement services determines in writing that the essential characteristics of the brand names included in the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade, brand name or equal specifications shall include a description of the particular design, functional or performance characteristics which are required. 
(3)  Nonrestrictive use of brand name or equal. Where a brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition. 
(4)  Brand name specification. Since use of a brand name specification is restrictive of product competition, it may be used only when the director of finance or his written designee is provided with a written determination from the requesting department head that only the identified brand name item will satisfy the city's needs. The director of finance shall seek to identify sources from which the designated brand name item can be obtained and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is practicable. If only one source can supply the requirement, the procurement shall be made under the provisions of section 2-184(f). 
(d)  Small purchases. 
(1)  Generally. Any contract not exceeding the amount required for competitive bidding as outlined in state competitive bid laws may be made in accordance with the small purchase procedures authorized in this subsection. Contract requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this subsection. Procurement services shall adopt operational procedures to facilitate small purchases. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply or service being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the proper accounting for the funds expended and facilitate an audit of the small purchase made. 
(2)  Small purchases of $1,000.00 up to the bid limit. Insofar as it is practical, as determined by procurement services, for small purchases of $1,000.00 up to the amount required for competitive bids, written competitive prices will be solicited from at least three businesses. Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible business offering the lowest quoted price. Such written quotes shall be maintained as a public record. 
(3)  Small purchases under $1,000.00. Procurement services shall adopt operational procedures for making small purchases of $1,000.00 or less. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply or service being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the proper accounting for the funds expended, and facilitate an audit of the small purchase made. 
(e)  Professional services. For the purpose of procuring professional services as defined by the competitive bid laws of the state, any department requiring such services may procure them on its own behalf or with the assistance of procurement services. Any such contract, with a value greater than required for competitive bidding, will require the approval of the city council in the form of a professional services contract. 
(f)  Sole-source procurement. A contract may be awarded without competition when the director of finance or his designee receives in writing a valid justification from the requesting department head/division manager that there is only one source for the required supply or service item or, by the nature of an item, the bid cannot be awarded by competition. Such written justification shall include specific facts which support the conclusion that there is only one source. Procurement services shall conduct a good-faith review of available sources and conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to price, qualifications, delivery and terms. Sole-source justifications must receive the approval of the director of finance and the mayor. 
(g)  Emergency procurements. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, the director of finance may make or authorize others to make emergency procurements of commodities or services, when there exists an emergency affecting public health, safety or convenience; provided that such emergency procurements shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor as approved by the director of finance shall be included in the contract file. As soon as practical, a record of each emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the amount of the contract, and a listing of the items procured under the contract. Such emergency actions and the reason shall be acknowledged by resolution and made public by the city council as soon as possible.

Any actual or prospective bidder, offeror, or contractor who is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract may protest to the city attorney, or designated representative.

g.  Entitlement of costs. In addition to any other relief, when a protest is sustained and the protesting bidder or offeror should have been awarded the contract under the solicitation but is not, then the protesting bidder or offeror shall be entitled to the reasonable costs incurred in connection with the solicitation, including bid preparation costs other than attorney's fees.

iii.  Has not reviewed the protest when presented an opportunity to do so. 
b.  Violations of federal law or regulations.

FTA will refer violations of federal law for which it does not have primary jurisdiction to the federal authority having proper jurisdiction. 
c.  Violations of state or local law or regulations. FTA will refer violations of state or local law to the state or local authority having proper jurisdiction. 
(4)  Prequalification system. The City of Huntsville does not prequalify vendors. The city may, however at some point, prequalify bidders, offeror's and products for procurement purposes. The decision of whether to require prequalification for eligibility to participate in procurement shall be made separately for every procurement and shall be approved by the procurement supervisor, in coordination with public transit. 
The city may prequalify bidders, offeror's and products for procurement purposes if: 
a.  The city ensures that all prequalification lists it uses are current; 
b.  The city ensures that all prequalification lists it uses include enough qualified sources to provide maximum full and open competition; and 
c.  The city permits potential bidders or offeror's to qualify during the solicitation period (from the issuance of the solicitation to its closing date). The city is not required to hold a particular solicitation open to accommodate a potential supplier that submits products for approval before or during that solicitation nor must the city expedite or shorten prequalification evaluations of bidders, offeror's, or products presented for review during the solicitation period. 
(5)  System for ensuring most efficient and economic purchase . The City of Huntsville, Alabama will ensure the most efficient and economic purchases are made by determining the following: 
a.  Consider whether to consolidate or break out the procurement to obtain the most economical purchase. Absent efforts to foster greater opportunities for Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs), the city shall not split a larger procurement merely to gain the advantage of micro-purchases or small purchase procedures. 
b.  Options . The city shall justify as needed all option quantities included in every solicitation and contract. 
c.  Lease versus purchase . It is usually less economical to lease equipment than to purchase it; however, there are some instances where this is not true. If a decision is made to lease equipment, a "Lease vs. Purchase" analysis should be undertaken. 
d.  In certain situations, the city equipment requirements may be more economically filled by rental than by purchase. The decision to rent rather than purchase must be made on an individual basis. Rental/lease should be used where it is in the best interest of the city and the purchasing policy will apply. 
e.  Available state and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services are utilized whenever possible, as applicable. When obtaining goods or services in this manner, all federal requirements, required clauses, and local procurement policies will be complied with. 
(6)  Procurement policies and procedures. The policies and procedures as outlined in this ordinance are carried out and overseen by the positions below to ensure effective and efficient contracts and compliance with all federal, state, and local, laws and regulations:

e.  Facilities Construction Projects EstimatorDepartment of General Services Facilities Project Office performs construction estimating, supervises and coordinates costing for construction projects from conceptual development through final completion. 
(7)  Independent cost estimate. According to the Common Grant Rule, the City of Huntsville, Alabama will perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action above the simplified acquisition threshold to establish an independent cost estimate before receiving bids or proposals. 
(8)  A&E geographic preference. The City of Huntsville, Alabama does not have a policy allowing geographical preference for A&E providers. The City of Huntsville, Alabama may identify a geographical preference for A&E providers on occasion, depending on the type and complexity of the project involved. 
(9)  Unreasonable qualification requirements. The City of Huntsville, Alabama will not have solicitation requirements which unduly restrict competition. 
(10)  Unnecessary experience and excessive bonding. The City of Huntsville, Alabama will not require unnecessary experience or excessive bonding. 
(11)  Organizational conflict of interest. The City of Huntsville, Alabama will analyze each planned acquisition in order to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the acquisition process as possible, and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate potential conflicts before contract award. An organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities, relationships, or contracts, a contractor is unable or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance or advice to the grantee; a contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired; or a contractor has an unfair competitive advantage. 
An organizational conflict of interest occurs when any of the following circumstances arise: 
a.  Lack of impartiality or impaired objectivity . When the contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial and objective assistance or advice to the recipient due to other activities, relationships, contracts, or circumstances. 
b.  Unequal access to information . The contractor has an unfair competitive advantage through obtaining access to nonpublic information during the performance of an earlier contract. 
c.  Biased ground rules . During the conduct of an earlier procurement, the contractor has established the ground rules for a future procurement by developing specifications, evaluation factors, or similar documents. 
(12)  Arbitrary action. Taking any arbitrary action in the procurement process, such as awarding to other than the most favorable contractor, will not be taken by the City of Huntsville, Alabama. 
(13)  Brand name restrictions. All specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the city's needs, and shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy as set forth in this section applies to all specifications and empowers procurement services to approve or disapprove all specifications, including, but not limited to, those prepared for the city by architects, engineers, designers and draftsmen. 
a.  Brand name or equal specification. Brand name or equal specifications may be used when procurement services determines in writing that: 
i.  No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available; 
ii.  Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not including a brand name specification; 
iii.  The nature of the product or the nature of the city's requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement; or 
iv.  Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the city's best interests. 
b.  Required characteristics. Unless procurement services determines in writing that the essential characteristics of the brand names included in the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade, brand name or equal specifications shall include a description of the particular design, functional or performance characteristics which are required. 
c.  Nonrestrictive use of brand name or equal. Where a brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition. 
d.  Brand name specification. Since use of a brand name specification is restrictive of product competition, it may be used only when the director of finance or his written designee is provided with a written determination from the requesting department head that only the identified brand name item will satisfy the city's needs. The director of finance shall seek to identify sources from which the designated brand name item can be obtained and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is practicable. If only one source can supply the requirement, the procurement shall be made under the provisions of subsection (b)(38) herein. 
(14)  Geographic preferences. The City of Huntsville, Alabama will not utilize any geographic preferences with procurements using FTA funding, unless allowable A&E services. 
(15)  Contract period of performance limitation . The period of performance generally should not exceed the time necessary to accomplish the purpose of the contract. The City of Huntsville, Alabama will not enter into any contract for rolling stock or replacement parts with a period of performance exceeding five years inclusive of options. All other types of contracts (supply, service, leases of real property, revenue and construction, etc.) will be based on sound business judgment. Additional factors to be considered include competition, pricing, fairness and public perception. Once a contract has been awarded, an extension of the contract term length that amounts to an out of scope change will require a sole source justification. 
(16)  Written procurement selection procedures. The city selection procedures and the solicitation(s) identify all requirements that offerors must fulfill and identify all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. The process is outlined in forms (9) Procurement Summary Form; and, (10) Procurement Decision Matrix in subsection (c)(9) and (10) herein. 
(17)  Solicitation prequalification criteria. The City of Huntsville, Alabama does not use prequalification requirements in solicitations as it is defined by FTA. The City of Huntsville, Alabama does use technical prequalification's that are termed prequalification in the city's procurement policy language. These technical qualifications are essential in two-step procurements and qualifications-based procurements, such as construction contracts. If at some future point the city determines to prequalify for eligibility that determination will be made separately for every procurement and follow the requirements below. 
The city may prequalify bidders, offeror's and products for procurement purposes if: 
a.  The city ensures that all prequalification lists it uses are current; 
b.  The city ensures that all prequalification lists it uses include enough qualified sources to provide maximum full and open competition; and 
c.  The city permits potential bidders or offeror's to qualify during the solicitation period (from the issuance of the solicitation to its closing date). The city is not required to hold a particular solicitation open to accommodate a potential supplier that submits products for approval before or during that solicitation nor must the city expedite or shorten prequalification evaluations of bidders, offerors, or products presented for review during the solicitation period. 
(18)  Award to responsible contractors. Upon the approval of the city council, contracts shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. 
(19)  Sound and complete agreement. All city contracts for commodities or services shall include provisions necessary to define the responsibilities and rights of the parties to the contract. The director of finance or his designee, after consultation with the city attorney, may issue clauses appropriate for supply or service contracts, addressing among others the following subjects: 
a.  The unilateral right of the city to order in writing changes in the work within the scope of the contract; 
b.  The unilateral right of the city to order in writing temporary stopping of the work or delaying performance that does not alter the scope of the contract; 
c.  Variations occurring between estimated quantities of work in contract and actual quantities; 
d.  Defective pricing; 
e.  Liquidated damages; 
f.  Specified excuses for delay, nonperformance, or non-delivery; 
g.  Termination of the contract for default; 
h.  Termination of the contract in whole or in part for the convenience of the city; or 
i.  Indemnity of the city by the vendor. 
(20)  No splitting (micro-purchase). The City of Huntsville, Alabama shall define small purchases in three ways and states in (1) that contract requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this subsection: 
a.  Generally . Any contract not exceeding the amount required for competitive bidding as outlined in state competitive bid laws may be made in accordance with the small purchase procedures authorized in this subsection. Contract requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this subsection. Procurement services shall adopt operational procedures to facilitate small purchases. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply or service being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the proper accounting for the funds expended and facilitate an audit of the small purchase made. 
b.  Small purchases of $2,000.00 up to the bid limit . Insofar as it is practical, as determined by procurement services, for small purchases of $2,000.00 up to the amount required for competitive bids, written competitive prices will be solicited from at least three businesses. Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible business offering the lowest quoted price. Such written quotes shall be maintained as a public record. 
c.  Small purchases under $2,000.00. Procurement services shall adopt operational procedures for making small purchases of $2,000.00 or less. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply or service being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the proper accounting for the funds expended, and facilitate an audit of the small purchase made. 
In addition to abiding by the city's definitions of small purchases, FTA grantees will recognize the FTA definition of micro-purchases of procurements of $10,000.00 and less and comply to FTA regulations accordingly. FTA grantees will not split a larger procurement merely to gain the advantage of micro-purchases or small purchase procedures. 
(21)  Fair and reasonable price determination [micro-purchase]. The city will obtain fair and reasonable pricing for all micro-purchases. Micro-procurement awards will be distributed equitably among qualified bidders. The determinations will be made and acknowledged with the following statement stamped on all appropriate invoices:

Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible business offering the lowest quoted price. Such written quotes shall be maintained. 
(24)  Clear, accurate, and complete specification. The city will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. All solicitations shall: 
a.  Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features that unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product, or service to be procured and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. 
The use of brand name product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. "Brand name or equal" purchase descriptions may only be used when an adequate specification cannot otherwise be provided. When using a "brand name or equal" purchase description, the salient physical and functional characteristics of the brand name product must be clearly set forth in the specification. 
b.  Identify all requirements that offeror's must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. 
(25)  Adequate competitionTwo or more competitors . The City of Huntsville, Alabama will utilize the sealed bid method of procurement according to the threshold requirement, when there are two or more bidders that are willing and able to compete effectively for the business. 
(26)  Firm fixed price (sealed bid). Firm fixed price contracts arising out of sealed bids that have been publicly solicited may include an economic price adjustment provision, incentive, or both, but will remained fixed irrespective of the contractor's cost experience in performance of contract.

(31)  Sufficient bid time (sealed bid). The City of Huntsville's Request for Bid Procedure is a solicitation of a bid opening for 15 days to allow sufficient time to prepare bids before the date of bid opening. All departments can request a longer bid solicitation time to accommodate sufficient time to prepare bids on specifications of a more complex or extensive nature. 
(32)  Bid opening (sealed bid). Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.

If the choice is made to include options, the following requirements apply: 
a.  Evaluation of options. Option quantities or periods contained in the contractor's bid or offer must be evaluated in order to determine contract award. When options have not been evaluated as part of the award, the exercise of such options will be considered a sole source procurement.

Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror's responsibility. 
Both FTA and the Common Grant Rules generally require each bidder to provide a bid guarantee equivalent to five percent of its bid price. The "bid guarantee" must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid to ensure that the bidder will honor its bid upon acceptance. 
(54)  Performance security (construction over $100,000.00). Bid bonds, performance bonds, and labor and material bonds or other security may be requested for supply contracts or service contracts as procurement services deems advisable to protect the city's interests, and in conformance with the Code of Ala. 1975, tits. 39 and 41 (Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 39-1-1 et seq., 41-1-1 et seq.). Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror's responsibility.

The revenue files will document economic analysis demonstrating that revenue contracts allowing use of federally funded assets will not interfere with transit operations and use. The type and extent of revenue contracts will be reviewed and determined on a case by case basis and in accordance with federal regulations. Determinations will be derived from the following: 
a.  Limited contract opportunities. If there are several potential competitors for a limited opportunity (such as advertising space on the side of a bus), the City of Huntsville, Alabama will use a competitive process to permit interested parties an equal chance to obtain that limited opportunity. 
b.  Open contract opportunities. If one party seeks access to a public transportation asset (such as a utility that might seek cable access in a subway system), and the City of Huntsville, Alabama is willing and able to provide contracts or licenses to other parties similarly situated (since there is room for a substantial number of such cables without interfering with transit operations), then competition would not be necessary because the opportunity to obtain contracts or licenses is open to all similar parties.

Sec. 2-222. - Cell phone policy. 
This section establishes the city's policy concerning the use of city cell phones that are provided to employees and officials for their official use, and establish the means by which the city will reimburse its employees and officials who use their personal cell phone for city business. In this section, the term "cell phone" means a mobile communication device having telephone capabilities, and the term "cell phone allowance" means the amount paid to employees to reimburse them for use of their personal cell phone for city business. The term "city phone" means a cell phone owned by the city and any related equipment used with it. 
(1)  Eligibility . 
a.  Elected officials. The city will not provide an elected official a city phone but will provide a cell phone allowance at the request of the official. 
b.  Employees . An employee may be furnished a city phone or receive a cell phone allowance only in the following situations: 
1.  Job responsibilities of the employee are such that it is in the city's best interest that the employee be able to communicate by cell phone for work-related reasons on a regular basis, and the use of other communications equipment, including a pager, is impractical; 
2.  The employee can significantly enhance work-related personal safety with a cell phone; or 
3.  The mayor or his/her designee requires the employee to be available by cell phone whenever possible. 
The city will furnish a city phone to an employee only when it is practical to share it with other employees, or as directed by the mayor or his/her designee. All other employees will receive a cell phone allowance when they qualify according to this policy. 
(2)  City phones . 
a.  Approval . The city will provide a city phone to an employee who qualifies under this policy at the discretion of the employee's department head. 
b.  Authorized uses. The use of a city phone shall be for official use, except in the case of emergencies. City phones cannot be used at any time in violation of local, state or federal laws, nor for the purpose of personal financial gain, nor in violation of any departmental work rules. 
c.  Authorized city cell phone vendors . Only vendors authorized by the city, in accordance with state law, will provide service related to city phones. 
(3)  Cell phone allowance. 
a.  Approval . Department head will submit a written or email request to the finance director for an employee to receive a cell phone allowance, to include employee's name, employee number, job title, basis for request, and monthly amount requested. 
The finance department will ensure the request is complete as required by this policy, obtain employee acknowledgement of this policy's requirements, and obtain approval of the request from the mayor or his/her designee when required. 
b.  Payment . An employee or official authorized to receive a cell phone allowance will receive a monthly payment, which will be included in his city payroll check. The payment will begin the first full month after approval, or as is consistent with finance department payroll policy. 
c.  Taxability . The cell phone allowance paid to an employee or official may be subject to or exempt from federal and state income taxes based on the regulations in effect from time to time. 
d.  Maximum amount . The amount of reimbursement must be consistent with the cost the employee is reasonably expected to incur for using his/her personal cell phone for city business, and in the best interest of the city, all communication options considered. The maximum amount is $35.00 per month, except in special high-use cases approved by the mayor or his/her designee, for which the maximum amount is $70.00 per month. These maximum amounts may be modified in the annual budget ordinance, and the amounts paid to any employee may be increased or decreased at any time at the discretion of the city. 
(4)  Responsibilities . 
a.  Department heads will establish policies to help ensure compliance with the terms of this policy and the Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual by department employees. 
b.  Employees furnished a city phone will use the device in compliance with the Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual, including those that pertain to city-owned information technology equipment. The city reserves the right to review all electronic records on city issued phones and to obtain relevant information from the telephone company or carrier, if the city administration considers in its sole discretion that there is a legitimate business reason to do so. Thus, employees do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the use of city issued cell phones and by use of such devices, do consent to all city sponsored monitoring. While employees receiving cell phone allowances applicable to the business use of their personal cell phone may generally have an expectation of privacy on their personal cell phones, there may be times when the city will have the right or duty to obtain access for business purposes to the electronic records relevant to the employee's business use of that personal cell phone. Such occasions may arise with respect to the city's duty to preserve or produce evidence relevant to anticipated or ongoing litigation or otherwise obtain access for law enforcement purposes. 
c.  Employees using a city phone, or personal cell phone for city business purposes, will not use it in a manner that would jeopardize the safety of themselves or others. Specifically, employees shall comply with Alabama state law as set forth in Code of Alabama, § 32-5A-350 which prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle on a public road, street, or highway in Alabama while using a wireless telecommunication device (as defined within the statute) to write, send, or read a text-based communication (as defined therein) except in certain specific circumstances detailed within the state statute. 
d.  Employees who receive a cell phone allowance agree to provide their cell phone number to their supervisor, to accept and make city business calls on their phone when required by their supervisor, not represent the cell phone he/she uses as the property of the city. 
e.  An employee must sign an acknowledgement of the terms of the policy that pertain to the employee prior to being issued a city phone or receiving a cell phone allowance. 
(5)  Administration . The finance department will administer this policy as directed by the mayor or his/her designee, is authorized to periodically require an employee to submit evidence that the cost of using his personal cell phone for city business is commensurate with his cell phone allowance, and is authorized to evaluate compliance with this policy.

(1)  Fails to provide clean, fresh potable water and food which is adequate for the animal's size, age, and physical condition. The water shall be either free flowing or provided in a removable receptacle that is properly secured to prevent tipping and rendering it useless, and shall also be of an adequate amount given the size of the animal and the environment in which the animal is kept to prevent the animal from overheating or dehydrating. The food provided to the animal shall be suitable for the animal's physical condition and age and in sufficient quality and quantities to maintain an adequate level of nutrition for the animal. 
(2)  Overrides, overworks, overloads or overdrives any animal, causing physical pain or suffering;

Any animal that is habitually kept outside or repeatedly left outside unattended shall be provided with a structurally sound, moisture-proof and wind-proof shelter large enough to keep the animal reasonably clean and dry. A shelter which does not adequately protect the animal from temperature extremes or precipitation, or which does not provide adequate ventilation or drainage, shall not comply with this section.

Shelter for an animal is defined and interpreted as a structure having four sides in addition to a roof and floor with one side having an entrance or an igloo type structure specifically designed for outdoor housing of an animal. The animal shall be able to enter, stand, sit, lie down and turn around in the shelter in a normal manner. A barrel, keg, or drum shall not be considered shelter. Transport carriers designed to move an animal from one location to another and which do not have solid walls shall not be considered shelter.

e.  The shelter shall be placed in an area that provides protection from the elements, including wind and rain, and direct rays of the sun, when sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort. 
(10)  Transports or carries any animal in a motor vehicle unless the animal is safely enclosed within the vehicle or protected by a cab or container, cage, cross-tether, or other device to prevent the animal from falling out of or being thrown from the vehicle; 
(11)  Places or confines an animal or allows an animal to be placed or confined in a motor vehicle under such conditions or for such a period of time as to endanger the health or welfare of the animal because of temperature, lack of food or water, or such other conditions as may reasonably be expected to cause suffering, disability or death; 
(12)  Restrains an unattended animal with a leash or tether, or fixed point chaining or tethering the animal, to a stationary object, including but not limited to a house, tree, fence, post, garage, or shed. 
(13)  Maintains any reptile in a manner that is deleterious to its health and well-being. Poor husbandry, poor nutrition and/or lack of proper preventative care are all considered cruel and deleterious to the welfare of the reptile and are unlawful; or 
(14)  Sets loose any reptile that is not native to the climate of North Alabama. 
(b)  Any person who unlawfully or maliciously kills, disables, disfigures or injures any animal shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; but this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the dehorning of cattle. 
(c)  The violation of any provision of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall result in the removal of the animal when the director or an enforcement officer determines that such removal is necessary for the safety of the animal.

(a)  Dogs . It shall be the duty of every owner or person in charge of a dog to keep the animal under effective restraint, while the dog is within the city, whether or not the dog is upon or away from his premises. It shall be unlawful for the owner or person in charge of any dog to fail to keep the animal under effective restraint. Proof that a dog is not properly restrained, whether on or off the premises of the owner or person in charge, shall be prima facie evidence of a violation. Negligent failure to provide or maintain effective restraint shall not be a defense. Competent evidence that the failure was occasioned by an unforeseeable and independent act of a third person shall shift the burden on the city to prove otherwise. 
(1)  It shall be the duty of every person owning or having the custody or control of a dog to physically restrain the dog when such dog is left unattended outside. The dog must be restrained so as to prevent the dog from leaving the premises of its owner or from coming in contact with public right-of-way or the property of another. 
(2)  Dogs may be restrained by means of a trolley system, or a runner attached to a pulley on a cable run, if the following conditions are met: 
a.  Such restraint shall be fixed in such a manner to allow the dog free use of the restraint without it becoming tangled, wrapped around an object or shortened to prevent injury or strangulation. 
b.  The restraint shall also be an appropriate weight for the dog and shall be affixed to a proper fitting harness or collar with a swivel attachment. The collar shall be properly fitted to the dog, made of a suitable material other than metal that does not cause damage to the dog's skin, and affixes the dog to a pulley or runner. 
c.  Only one dog shall be tethered to each cable run. 
d.  The tether shall be attached to a properly fitting harness or collar worn by the dog. Choke collars, pinch collars and prong collars are prohibited for purposes of tethering a dog to a cable run. 
e.  There shall be a swivel on both ends of the tether to minimize tangling of the tether. 
f.  The tether and cable run shall be of adequate size and strength to effectively restrain the dog. The size and weight of the tether shall not be excessive, as determined by the HAS officer, considering the age, size and health of the dog. 
g.  The length of the tether from the cable run to the dog's harness should allow access to a reasonable available exercise area and should allow continuous access to water and shelter. The pulley system shall be of appropriate configuration to confine the dog to the owner's property, to prevent the tether from extending over an object or an edge that could result in injury to the dog, and to prevent the tether from becoming tangled with or impeded by other objects or dogs. 
h.  The dog is at least six months of age or older. 
(3)  Dogs may be restrained by confining within a fenced yard or enclosure so long as there is an adequate space for exercise based on a dimension of at least 200 square feet for the first dog, and an additional 100 square feet for each additional dog, up to three dogs, including a dry area for each animal to rest or stand. Provided further that said enclosure shall be made of chain link, or similar type materials, and shall be of sufficient height to prevent the dog from escaping. 
(4)  The use of underground electric fencing systems shall satisfy physical restraint so long as the owner assures: 
a.  The underground electric fence system is in working order; 
b.  The animal is trained in accordance with the fencing system; 
c.  The animal is wearing a functional fence collar; 
d.  The property is clearly and prominently marked indicating the existence of the underground electronic fencing system with a minimum of one sign on the property; 
e.  The underground electronic fencing system shall not allow the animal to progress closer than ten feet in proximity to any public sidewalk, public street or other public right-of-way; 
(5)  Underground electronic fencing is prohibited for dogs deemed to be dangerous as defined in section 5-1. 
(6)  A dog that can snap or bite a person through a fence shall not be considered enclosed by the fence or properly restrained. 
(7)  Multiple dogs that fight each other shall not be kept within the same enclosure. 
(b)  Cats. It shall be unlawful for the owner or any person having custody or control of any cat within the city to allow such cat to be a nuisance, cause destruction or damage to the property of another, or to run at large; however, no prosecution shall be commenced and no arrest made pursuant to this section except upon affidavit made before and warrant issued by a judge or magistrate of municipal court. This section is not applicable to community cats, or a community cat caregiver, as determined by the director.

Sec. 8-185. - Notice of hearing.

(1)  For each ambulance, such insurance policy shall provide insurance coverage in the amount of $1,000,000.00 for personal injury or death arising from any one accident and $50,000.00 for property damage liability and uninsured motorist's liability coverage in the sum of $20,000.00 per person for bodily injury liability and $40,000.00 per accident for bodily injury liability or $500,000.00 combined single limit liability with $1,000,000.00 excess liability coverage whether the operation of any such vehicle is by such person, his agent, servant or employee, or by any person in possession of such vehicle.

(3)  Every insurance policy required under this section shall contain a provision for a continuing liability under the policy to the full amount, notwithstanding any recovery, that the liability of the insurer shall not be affected by the insolvency or the bankruptcy of the insured, and that until the policy is canceled the insurance company will not be relieved from liability on account of nonpayment of premium, or any act or omission by the named assured. Such policy of insurance shall be further conditioned for the payment of any and all judgments, up to the limits of such policy, recovered against any person other than the owner, his agent or employee, who may operate the policy with the consent or acquiescence of the owner. 
(4)  In order to meet the policy filing requirements in this section, as an alternative, the insured may file a binder of liability and property damage insurance as required in this section and a letter from the insuring agent which shall state that the coverage is bound, the name of the company, the effective date of coverage, the limits of liability and a list of all vehicles covered and proof that the agent has the ability to bind the issuing company. The policy of insurance so bound shall be filed with the city clerk-treasurer within 60 days of the effective date of coverage.

Sec. 12-292. - Measurement procedure. 
(a)  Sound level meter operation. The sound level meter shall be operated in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's instructions and as follows: 
(1)  The microphone shall be located at a height of not less than two feet (0.6m) nor more than six feet (1.8m) above the plane of the roadway surface and not less than 3½ feet (1.1m) and not more than 4½ feet (1.4m) above the surface on which the microphone stands. 
(2)  a.  When the sound level measurement system is handheld or is otherwise monitored by a person located near its microphone, the holder must orient himself relative to the highway in a manner consistent with the recommendation of the manufacturer of the sound level measurement system. 
b.  In no case shall the holder or observer be closer than two feet (0.6m) from the system's microphone, nor shall he locate himself between the microphone and the vehicle being measured. 
(3)  The microphone shall be oriented toward the measurement area consistent with the recommendation of the sound level instrument's manufacturer. If the manufacturer does not recommend an orientation for its microphone, the microphone shall be pointed towards the vehicle being measured. 
(4)  The meter shall be set for the A-weighted network and fast response mode. 
(5)  An external calibration check and battery check shall be made before and after each period of use and at intervals not exceeding two hours when the instrument is used longer than a two-hour period. 
(6)  Measurements shall be made of the sound level generated by the motor vehicle regardless of the highway grade, load, acceleration or deceleration. 
(7)  The sound level generated by the motor vehicle is the highest reading observed on the sound level meter as the vehicle passes through the measurement area, corrected, when appropriate, in accordance with the rules in subsection (c) of this section. The sound level of the vehicle being measured must be observed to rise at least six dB(A) before the maximum sound level occurs and to fall at least six dB(A) after the maximum sound level occurs in order to be considered a valid sound level reading. 
(b)  Test site measurement area requirements. 
(1)  Standard test sites. 
a.  Measurements shall be made at a test site which is adjacent to and includes a portion of a traveled lane of a public highway. A microphone target point shall be established on the centerline of the traveled lane of the highway, and a microphone location point shall be established on the ground surface not less than 35 feet (10.7m) or more than 83 feet (25.3m) from the microphone target point and on a line that is perpendicular to the centerline of the traveled lane of the highway and that passes through the microphone target point. In the case of a standard test site, the microphone location point is 50 feet (15.2m) from the microphone target point. Within the test site is a triangular measurement area. A plan view diagram of a standard test site, having an open site within a 50-foot (15.2m) radius of both the microphone target point and the microphone location point, is shown in figure 1. Measurements may be made at a test site having smaller or greater dimensions in accordance with the rules in subsection (b)(2). 
  
Standard Test Site Highway Operations 
b.  The test site must be an open site, essentially free of large sound-reflecting objects. However, the following objects may be within the test site, including the triangular measurement area: 
1.  Small cylindrical objects such as fire hydrants or telephone or utility poles; 
2.  Mailboxes; 
3.  Traffic railings of any type of construction except solid concrete barriers (see subsection (c)(3)d. of this section); or 
4.  One or more curbs having a vertical height of one foot (0.3m) or less. 
c.  The following objects may be within the test site if they are outside of the triangular measurement area of the site: 
1.  Any vertical surface (such as a billboard), regardless of size, having a lower edge more than 15 feet (4.6m) higher than the surface of the traveled lane of the highway; 
2.  Any uniformly smooth sloping surface slanting away from the highway (such as a rise in grade alongside the highway) with a slope that is less than 45 degrees above the horizontal; 
3.  Any surface slanting away from the highway that is 45 degrees or more and not more than 90 degrees above the horizontal, if all points on the surface are more than 15 feet (4.6m) above the surface of the traveled lane of the highway. 
d.  The surface of the ground within the measurement area must be relatively flat. The test site shall be a soft test site. However, if the test site is determined to be hard, the correction factor specified in subsection (c)(2) of this section shall be applied to the measurement. 
e.  The traveled lane of the highway within the test site must be dry, paved with relatively smooth concrete or asphalt, and substantially free of the following: 
1.  Holes or other defects which would cause a motor vehicle to emit irregular tire, body or chassis impact noise; and 
2.  Loose material such as gravel or sand. 
f.  The traveled lane of the highway on which the microphone target point is situated must not pass through a tunnel or underpass located within 200 feet (16m) of that point. 
(2)  Nonstandard sites. 
a.  If the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point is other than 50 feet (15.2m), the test site must be an open site within a radius from both points which is equal to the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point. 
b.  Plan view diagrams on nonstandard test sites are shown in figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 illustrates a test site which is larger than a standard test site and is based upon a 60-foot (18.3m) distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point. Figure 3 illustrates a test site which is smaller than a standard test site and is based upon a 35-foot (10.7m) distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point. 
  
Nonstandard Test Site 60 feet 
  
Nonstandard Test Site 35 feet 
(c)  Correction factors. The rules in this subsection specify correction factors which are added to or subtracted from the reading of the sound level generated by a motor vehicle, as displayed on a sound level measurement system, during the measurement of the motor vehicle's sound level emissions at a test site which is not a standard site. The purpose of adding or subtracting a correction factor is to equate the sound level reading actually generated by the motor vehicle to the sound level reading it would have generated if the measurement had been made at a standard test site. 
(1)  Distance correction factors. If the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point is other than 50 feet (15.2m), the maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle shall be corrected as specified in the following table: 
_____
Distance Correction Factors 
Distance Between the Microphone Location Point and the Microphone Target Point Is: 	Value dB(A) To Be Applied to the Observed Sound Level Reading: 
35 feet (10.7m) or more but less than 39 feet (11.9m) 	-3 
39 feet (11.9m) or more but less than 43 feet (13.1m) 	-2 
43 feet (13.1m) or more but less than 48 feet (14.6m) 	-1 
48 feet (14.6m) or more but less than 58 feet (17.7m) 	 0 
58 feet (17.7m) or more but less than 70 feet (21.3m) 	+1 
70 feet (21.3m) or more but less than 83 feet (25.3m) 	+2 
 
_____ 
(2)  Ground surface correction factors. When measurements are made at a test site which is hard, a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be subtracted from the maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle. 
(3)  Sound-reflecting surface correction factors. The distances between the microphone line and its nearest sound-reflecting surface and between the centerline of the lane of travel and its nearest sound-reflecting surface shall be measured. These distances shall be located on the nomogram in figure 4 on their respective axis, and the two marks shall be connected by a straight line. The point on the central axis that is intersected by the straight line indicates the dB correction factor that shall be applied to the sound level reading obtained from such vehicle passing through the site. (The dotted line in figure 4 illustrates a -2 dB(A) correction for sound-reflecting surfaces at 52 feet from the center of the lane of travel and 25 feet from the microphone line.) 
a.  The correction factors determined by the nomogram in figure 4 shall be used only for sound-reflecting surfaces that are parallel to the lane of travel. 
b.  Basically parallel surfaces may have irregularities or projections of not more than two feet, measured perpendicular to the lane of travel, with the distance shown in figures 1, 2 and 3 measured from the nearest projecting surfaces. 
c.  Sound-reflecting surfaces not basically parallel to the lane of travel shall be a distance as specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. This restriction does not apply to surfaces that are perpendicular to the lane of travel and behind the parallel surface for which corrections are made, such as a fence, or the sidewalls of a building. 
d.  Distance measurements from smooth embankments covered with vegetation, concrete, asphalt, dirt, or other relatively smooth cover shall be made from the point where the slope begins to exceed 45 degrees above horizontal. Measurements from nonsmooth embankments shall be made from the point where the irregularity begins. 
(d)  Application of correction factors. If two correction factors apply to a measurement, they are applied cumulatively.

Sec. 12-297. - Sound amplification systems. 
(a)  No person shall operate or cause to be operated any sound amplification system, either in a motor vehicle or separate from a vehicle, on any public premises so as to produce an audible sound measured at least 25 feet from the system. Measurement of the audible sound shall be by the auditory senses, based on direct line of sight. 
(b)  No person shall operate or cause to be operated any sound amplification system, either in a motor vehicle or separate from a vehicle, on any premises of public access so as to produce an audible sound measured at least 25 feet from the system. Measurement of the audible sound shall be by the auditory senses, based on direct line of sight. If the person operating or causing to be operated the sound amplification system is the owner or lessee of the real property upon which the sound amplification system is being operated, then the provisions of section 12-265 of this article shall apply rather than the provisions of this subsection. Absent compelling circumstantial or documentary evidence that the person operating or causing to be operated a sound amplification system on any premises of public access has a possessory interest in the real property upon which the system is being operated, the presumption shall be that the person operating or causing to be operated a sound amplification system on any premises of public access is neither an owner nor a lessee of the real property upon which the system is being operated. In any proceeding instituted pursuant to the provisions of section 12-291 of this division for violation of this subsection, the person subject to such proceeding may assert holding a possessory interest in the real property upon which the sound amplification system was operated as an affirmative defense. 
(c)  This section shall make no distinction between stopped, standing, parked or moving motor vehicles. 
(d)  Possession by a person of the sound amplification system in subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be prima facie evidence that the person operated the system. 
(e)  Exemptions (1), (2), (3), (6) and (8) of section 12-262 shall apply to this section.

Floodway fringe means that portion of the floodplain lying outside the floodway. 
Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
Grading means any operation or occurrence by which the existing site elevations are changed; or where any ground cover, natural or manmade, is removed; or any watercourse or body of water, either natural or manmade, is relocated on any site, thereby creating an unprotected area. This includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling or any combination, and shall apply to the land in its cut or filled condition. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Impervious surface means any ground or structural surface that water cannot penetrate or through which water penetrates with great difficulty. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage and in an area other than the basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the requirements of this article or of the regulations and technical guidelines promulgated pursuant to this article. 
Retention means the prevention of storm runoff from direct discharge into receiving waters. Examples include systems which discharge through percolation, exfiltration, filtered bleed-down and evaporation processes. 
Sediment means solid material, both mineral and organic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved from its site of origin by air, water or gravity as a product of erosion.

Stripping means any activity that removes or significantly disturbs the vegetative surface cover, including clearing and grubbing operations. 
Structure means any combination of materials, including buildings constructed or erected, the use of which requires location on or in the ground or attachment to anything having location on the ground, including but not limited to buildings, towers, carports, signs, billboards and fences, but not including telephone poles and overhead wires, fences less than three feet high, retaining walls or terraces. 
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a structure, taking place during the life of a structure, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions. 
Watercourse means a channel, natural depression, slough, gulch, stream, creek, pond, reservoir or lake in which storm runoff and floodwater flows either regularly or infrequently. This includes major drainageways for carrying urban storm runoff.

Sec. 15-38. - Exemptions. 
(a)  In addition to any other exemptions required to be provided under applicable federal and state laws, or that are otherwise provided for in this article, the following shall be exempt from the business license requirements of this article: 
(1)  Farmer's exemption. 
a.  For purposes of this subsection (1), the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection a.: 
(i)  The term farmer means a farmer or other individual engaged in the production of farm products for sale or other disposition exclusively of articles produced by him. 
(ii)  The term farm product means all agricultural, horticultural, vegetable and fruit products of the soil, meats, marine food products, poultry, eggs, dairy products, wool, hides, feathers, nuts and honey, but shall not apply to seeds sold at retail, nor include timber products, tea, coffee or pelts of fur-bearing animals. 
b.  No business license shall be required of any farmer; provided, however, it shall be unlawful for any farmer to sell or offer for sale within the corporate limits of the city any farm product produced by him without first having obtained, without cost, an annual farmer's permit from the city clerk-treasurer. 
c.  In the event a farmer applying for a farmer's permit holds a grower's permit issued by the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, he shall include a copy of the grower's permit with his application. Any farmer selling with a grower's permit shall be allowed to sell or offer for sale only those farm products listed on the grower's permit at the location specified. Any farmer selling any other farm product not listed on the grower's permit shall forfeit the exemption allowed for under this article for the items not listed. 
(2)  Exemption for public school booster organizations. No license shall be required of any bona fide nonprofit school music, academic, or athletic group, group booster, or parents' group when raising money by selling "band" candy, ornaments, fruitcakes, fresh fruit or gift items, or washing cars, etc., where all of the profits from such sales will go to support the school band, math team, athletic team, cheerleaders, etc., by purchasing equipment, musical instruments, or uniforms, or to pay for transportation to and from games, tournaments, competitions, or exhibitions where such trips or activities, games, tournaments, competitions, or exhibitions are approved by the school board of the city schools. If a retail sale of these items is made, an academic sponsor or parents group would be responsible to see that any and all sales tax would be collected and paid to the city clerk-treasurer. 
(3)  Certain nonprofits. Any nonprofit corporation formed under the laws of Alabama which is operated to enable municipalities that become members of such nonprofit corporation to finance or refinance capital projects and related undertakings, on a cooperative basis, and whose board of directors or other governing body consists primarily of elected officials of municipalities. 
(b)  The person claiming an exemption from business licensing hereunder shall provide appropriate proof of eligibility as may be required by the city clerk or by applicable federal or state laws. 
(c)  Exemption from licensing under this section does not relieve any person from complying with other applicable city laws including the zoning ordinance and technical codes of the city. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-39. - License application process. 
(a)  Application. Each taxpayer who is required to purchase a business license shall make application to the city-clerk treasurer's office utilizing forms provided by the city clerk for that purpose. Such applications shall be sworn to by the taxpayer or its duly authorized agent. Although the city clerk-treasurer's office may assist the person in determining the proper classification for the license and shall have the authority to determine the proper license classification, the taxpayer shall be responsible for obtaining a business license for the proper classification. Where a taxpayer who is already licensed under this article or whose existing business license is under renewal is adding a new line of business which requires licensing under this article, the taxpayer shall be required to make application for the new line of business. 
(b)  Contact information. All taxpayers making application for a business license shall provide sufficient contact information to the city clerk for the purpose of receiving any notice or other documentation required to be sent to the taxpayer by the city under this chapter. 
(c)  Code compliance procedure. Applications shall be processed in accordance with the following section 15-40. 
(d)  Building contractors or subcontractors. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, where a business license is for contractors or subcontractors who are subject to the city's building, gas, plumbing, or electrical codes, the city clerk-treasurer may direct that applications and renewals for such business licensing be initiated with, processed through, or administered in whole or part by the city's inspection division. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-40. - Code compliance procedure. 
(a)  Definition. For the purposes of this section, the term "suitable for licensing" or "suitability for licensing" means that the application for business licensing includes the applicant, the proposed business to be licensed, its premises, and its operation: (1) is in compliance with all applicable laws, including the zoning laws, building and other technical codes, fire codes, health codes, and this chapter; (2) has met prerequisites required for licensing; and (3) is not found to have a condition to exist which would constitute a basis for action being taken under subsection 15-56(a). 
(b)  Code compliance procedure. Upon submission of a completed application for a business license and prior to the issuance of same, the city clerk-treasurer's office is authorized to investigate whether the application is suitable for licensing. Such investigation may include the recommendations of other city departments as to suitability for licensing. Such recommendations may include recommendations for approval, recommendations for disapproval stating the reasons therefor, or recommendations for approval subject to stated conditions being met which make the application suitable for licensing. Upon receipt of the recommendations of applicable departments, the city clerk-treasurer is authorized to determine suitability for licensing. The city clerk-treasurer shall not determine that an application is suitable for licensing where at least one department has recommended disapproval. 
(c)  Disapproval; conditional approval. If an application for licensing is not approved, the city clerk's office shall provide written notice to the applicant of the disapproval and the reason for disapproval. If the application is approved with conditions, the applicant shall accept the conditions in writing and, thereafter, the business license shall be issued subject to such conditions, which shall become part of the business license and a violation of such conditions shall constitute a violation of this article. If the applicant does not accept the conditions, the application shall be disapproved and written notice thereof provided to the applicant. 
(d)  Appeal of disapproval. A person who applied for a business license that has been disapproved may appeal as follows: 
(1)  Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of the disapproval the person must submit to the city clerk-treasurer's office a signed written notice that the disapproval is being appealed. 
(2)  The city clerk-treasurer's office shall set an informal administrative hearing before the city clerk-treasurer, or his delegate which shall be a city license inspector, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of the appeal. Reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be given by the city clerk-treasurer's office to the appellant in writing. The thirty-day period may be extended by the city clerk-treasurer for good cause shown, or by agreement between the city clerk-treasurer and the appellant. The city clerk-treasurer shall inform the other city department which recommended disapproval or conditional approval of the appeal, and such other department shall have a representative who is familiar with the reason therefor and who has the discretion to amend or remove the disapproval or conditional approval present at the administrative hearing. The administrative hearing shall be controlled and conducted by the city clerk-treasurer, or his delegate who must be a license inspector of the city. The participants shall discuss the circumstances giving rise to the action appealed from in good faith and ascertain whether an agreement can be reached to alter, amend, mitigate, or remove the action appealed from. The city clerk-treasurer, or his delegate who must be a license inspector of the city, shall have the final decision whether to alter, amend, mitigate, or remove the disapproval or approval with conditions and shall notify the appellant in writing of his decision within 14 days after the close of the hearing. 
(3)  If the appellant is aggrieved by the decision of the city clerk-treasurer, or his delegate, the appellant may appeal the decision to the city council by filing a written notice of the appeal with the city clerk's office within 15 days after receipt of the ruling from the city clerk-treasurer. The appeal shall be forwarded to the city council which shall set a hearing thereon. The appellant shall be given at least ten days' advance written notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing on the appeal, and the hearing on the appeal shall be conducted by the city council in the same manner as license revocation hearings under subsection 15-56(c)(2). In the event the appellant fails to appear at the hearing before the city council, provided due notice has been given thereof, the appellant shall have waived any right it has to contest the action taken. 
(4)  Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing the city council shall, by resolution, decide whether to alter, amend, mitigate, or remove the disapproval or approval with conditions. Thereafter, the appellant shall be notified of the council's decision by providing the appellant with a copy of the resolution. The city council's decision shall be final, subject to any applicable rights of judicial review provided by state law. 
(5)  Where the determination under an appeal under this subsection (d) is an approval with conditions, the applicant shall accept the conditions in writing and, thereafter, the business license shall be issued subject to such conditions, which shall become part of the business license. 
(e)  Alternative procedure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, in the event there is an existing appeals process in place for the department that recommended disapproval or approval with conditions, such process shall be followed in lieu of the one provided for in this section. Such appeals include but are not necessarily limited to appeals under the zoning laws and the technical codes of the city. 
(f)  Code compliance not a certification of lawfulness; no cause of action. The code compliance procedure is entirely regulatory in nature as an exercise of the police powers of the city, and for determining whether a license shall be issued. It shall not relieve the taxpayer from compliance with all such laws, codes, ordinances, rules, and regulations. Issuance of a business license shall not constitute a certification, endorsement, finding, representation, warranty, or guarantee by the city or the city clerk-treasurer that the taxpayer is conducting a lawful business or is otherwise in compliance with such laws, codes, ordinances, rules, and regulations; or that the taxpayer or its business does not and shall not negatively impact public health, safety, or welfare. The code compliance procedure and the issuance of a business license shall not give rise to any cause of action against the city for any activity by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's business, even if the city erroneously concludes that the taxpayer is in compliance. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-41. - Effect of state regulations. 
(a)  As a prerequisite to licensing, every person who applies for a license under this chapter to conduct any trade or business that is subject to state licensing board oversight shall submit proof satisfactory to the city clerk's office that such person has obtained all applicable permits, licenses, and certifications that are required by law to conduct the trade or business. Such proof includes a true and accurate copy of the taxpayer's card or certificate, issued by the particular state licensing board within 14 months of the date on which the taxpayer applies for a business license. 
(b)  Any establishments selling articles of food or drinks must have a permit from the county health department before the city shall issue a license. 
(c)  The city clerk-treasurer shall determine, upon receipt of an application to obtain or renew a business license, whether the applicant's business is identified as an industrial activity under the regulations adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR 122, "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System [NPDES] Permit Application Regulation for Storm Water Discharges; Final Rule." If the applicant's business is identified as an industrial activity, the applicant will be required to enter, on the license application form, the NPDES discharge permit number issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the permit's date of expiration. Failure to enter the valid NPDES permit number on the application shall result in the city clerk-treasurer's sending a copy of the applicant's license to ADEM. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-42. - Issuance of business license generally; issuance fee; payment by check. 
(a)  Issuance generally. Upon meeting all conditions for the issuance of a business license, the city clerk-treasurer shall issue an appropriate license, but the issuance and grant thereof is expressly conditioned upon the truth and accuracy of the application and sworn statements. The license shall be revocable as provided in this article if such information was untruthful, inaccurate, or if the amount paid by the licensee was insufficient. 
(b)  Issuance fee. In addition to the amount of each license fee due the city, a fee of ten dollars ($10.00), or the current amount set by the Alabama Department of Revenue, for issuing or renewing a license shall be charged and paid as a part of each license issued. Such issuance fee shall be paid at the time of issuing or renewing the license and shall not be prorated. 
(c)  Payment by check. Whenever a business license or business license receipt shall be issued in return for any check, the license shall not be valid or of any force or effect unless such check shall be duly paid upon presentation to the drawee. The city clerk-treasurer shall collect an administrative bad check charge as provided by section 2-154 of this Code on any and every check that is not honored, for whatever reason, upon presentation to the drawee. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-43. - Terms of licenses; transfers. 
(a)  Term. All licenses due the city shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year in which they are issued, except in cases where a daily, weekly, or monthly license is specifically provided. Every license shall automatically expire at the end of the period for which it is valid. For a flat rate business license that is taken out after July 1, only one-half of the license fee shall be charged and collected, except for those classifications for which daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or semiannual licenses are provided. 
(b)  Transfer of licenses. 
(1)  Subject to subsection (b)(2) of this section, no license shall be transferred to a different taxpayer, person, location, or otherwise; provided that a mere change in the name or ownership of a taxpayer that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other form of legal entity now or hereafter recognized by the laws of Alabama shall not constitute a transfer for purposes of this section, unless: 
a.  The change requires the taxpayer to obtain a new federal employer identification number or Department of Revenue taxpayer identification number; or 
b.  The subject license is one for the sale of alcoholic beverages, in which case a new business license application and approval shall be required as provided in chapter 3 of this Code. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (b)(1) of this section, upon application for a transfer and a surrender of the original license, the city clerk-treasurer may allow a business license, other than an alcoholic beverage license regulated by chapter 3 of this Code, to be transferred once during the license year to reflect a physical change in location; provided, however, the transfer application shall be subject to the same code compliance process as an original license as such compliance process relates to the suitability of the proposed premises for the business or its operation. It shall be unlawful for the taxpayer, its principals, servants, agents, or employees, to conduct or allow the conduct of business at the new location until the transfer has been approved and a license issued for the new location and each day a violation of this subsection occurs constitutes a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-44. - License required for each location and line of business; posting of license required. 
(a)  License specific to location. Every taxpayer required to purchase a business license under this article shall obtain a separate business license for each location at which it does business in the city; provided, however, a regularly licensed business selling at a temporary location in the city for no more than five days and no more than twice in a given license year shall not be required to pay an additional issuance fee in relation to the business license issued for the temporary location. 
(b)  More than one line of business. Any taxpayer engaged in multiple lines of business shall purchase a license for each separate line of business from which the taxpayer derived more than ten percent of its gross receipts during the preceding license year. For each business license, the gross receipts which are taxed with regard to such license shall be only those gross receipts which arise within the line of business which is the subject of the license, except as provided in subsection (c), other provisions of this article, or as otherwise provided by law. 
(c)  Gross receipts not meeting ten percent threshold. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the gross receipts derived from one or more additional lines of business of the taxpayer if those gross receipts do not exceed the required ten percent threshold for the purchase of a second or multiple business licenses. Instead, those gross receipts shall be included in the business license for the taxpayer's primary line of business. 
(d)  Posting of license. Each business license is required to be conspicuously posted or displayed at the location where such business is conducted except for that portion of the license that lists the taxpayer's business license tax or other financial information. Any transient or nonresident person doing business within the city who does not have a permanent business location in the city shall carry such license either upon his person or in any vehicle or other conveyance which is used in such business. A nontransient license must show the location of business and is valid only at the indicated location. The taxpayer shall, upon request, immediately show the license to any license inspector with the city clerk's office or any law enforcement officer of the city. 
(e)  Compliance with other city laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, where a taxpayer is not required to purchase a business license for a particular line of business because the ten percent threshold has not been met, the taxpayer shall nevertheless comply with and be subject to applicable city laws that govern the business including the zoning laws, fire codes, building codes, and other technical codes of the city. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-45. - Renewal dates. 
(a)  Annual renewal. Each annual business license shall be due on January 1 of each year and shall be renewed on or before January 31 of each year and shall be delinquent if renewed after January 31. If the due date for payment of any business license hereunder falls on a weekend or a holiday recognized by the city from time to time, the due date shall automatically be extended until the next business day. 
(b)  Insurance companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, insurance company licenses shall be renewed annually on or before March 1, in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-122, and the license tax due according to the license schedule shall be accompanied by the certified statement of the amount of gross premiums received during the preceding year. Failure to furnish such statement or to pay such sum shall subject the company and its agents to those penalties as prescribed for doing business without a license as provided for in this article. 
(c)  When received. A renewal is deemed received on the day payment is actually made in the city clerk-treasurer's office, or, if sent by the United States mail and received in the city clerk's office within a reasonable time, the day it is lawfully postmarked. For those business licenses which the city clerk has directed to be renewed through the inspection division, payment shall be made to the inspection division. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-46. - Renewal notices and taxpayer duty to report certain changes. 
The city clerk-treasurer's office shall mail or otherwise transmit a renewal reminder notice to each taxpayer that purchased a business license during the preceding license year, via regular U.S. mail addressed to the taxpayer's last known mailing address, on or before December 31 of the current license year. The failure of the city clerk-treasurer's office to comply with the preceding sentence shall not, however, preclude it from enforcing the business license tax laws against a taxpayer, but shall preclude the assessment of any fines or penalties otherwise due for late payment until ten days after a renewal reminder notice has been mailed to the taxpayer at its last known mailing address as indicated in the records of the city clerk-treasurer's office, or personally delivered to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer then fails or refuses to remit the business license tax due for such license year within the ten-day period. If the city clerk-treasurer's office mails a renewal reminder notice to the last known mailing address of the taxpayer, as indicated in the records of the city clerk-treasurer's office, there shall exist a presumption that the city clerk-treasurer's office has complied with the above provisions. The city clerk-treasurer's office shall not be precluded from assessing fines and penalties otherwise due for late payment if the taxpayer does not notify the city clerk-treasurer's office of a change in address within 90 days after changing such address. Taxpayers shall notify the city clerk-treasurer's office of a change of mailing address within 90 days of the address change. In like manner, taxpayers shall notify the city clerk-treasurer's office of a change in their federal employer identification number or Alabama Department of Revenue taxpayer identification number within a reasonable time after such number is changed.

Secs. 15-4715-55. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 3. - ENFORCEMENT 
 
Sec. 15-56. - Action taken against licensing. 
(a)  Basis for action. Any business license issued pursuant to this article may be revoked or suspended by the city council after notice and hearing for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  The taxpayer, its principal, agent, servant, or employee violates or has violated any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city, or any federal or state law, rule, or regulation, relating to the license, business, business premises, or business activity, to which the license or application pertains. 
(2)  The taxpayer, its principal, agent, servant, or employee, violates or aids or abets in violating or knowingly permits or suffers to be violated any criminal ordinance of the city or any criminal law of the state on the licensed premises, or under color of license. 
(3)  Any application, affidavit, return, statement, or other document filed by or on behalf of the taxpayer under this chapter contains false or misleading information or an omission of a material fact. 
(4)  The business or its operation is, or is reasonably likely to become if allowed to commence or continue, offensive, injurious, or dangerous to the public health, safety, or general welfare, to the extent of constituting a nuisance. 
(5)  The taxpayer fails or has failed to pay within the time prescribed by law any business license or tax liability for which a final assessment has been entered, if one is required to be entered under this chapter, and for which all direct appeals have been exhausted or the time to appeal has expired, or for which the taxpayer or license applicant is required to pay as the result of a conviction for which no further direct appeal is available, or any other liability due and owing to the city after any applicable process for judicial or administrative review has been concluded or has expired. 
(6)  The taxpayer fails to meet any qualification, criteria, or credentialing standard under federal, state, or municipal law required in order to engage in the kind of business to which the license relates. 
(7)  The taxpayer or its principal has been convicted of a felony within the past five years that is related to activity that tends to show that licensing of the business in question would place the health, safety, or welfare of the general public at risk. 
(8)  Any other reason provided or allowed by law or rule. 
(b)  Non-renewal. The conditions set forth hereinabove as grounds for suspension or revocation of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license by the city clerk-treasurer. In the case of non-renewal, the taxpayer may appeal the city clerk's decision to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city-clerk-treasurer's office within 15 days after receipt of the notice of non-renewal. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal the city clerk-treasurer shall petition the city council to set a hearing thereon in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Process. 
(1)  The city council, upon petition by the city-clerk treasurer, shall set a hearing on the matter of revoking, suspending, or refusing to renew a license. Notice of the hearing and grounds for the revocation, suspension, or non-renewal of the license shall be in writing and served on the taxpayer at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. 
(2)  At such hearing, the taxpayer shall have the right to present evidence, the right to introduce witnesses, and the right to be represented by an attorney. The public hearing shall be recorded or transcribed for the purpose of maintaining a reasonably accurate record of the proceedings. Provided, however, the city council shall not be required to follow rules of evidence or procedure unless specifically required by law or ordinance. 
(3)  The taxpayer may elect, at any time prior to the hearing, to waive in writing the taxpayer's right to a hearing and concede the basis for action being taken against the license; in which case the city council may proceed to take action against the license in accordance with this section. In the event the taxpayer fails to appear at the hearing, provided due notice has been given thereof, the taxpayer shall have waived any right it has to contest the basis for action being taken against the license. 
(d)  Action taken. Within 30 days following the close of the hearing contemplated by paragraph (c) of this section the city council may, by resolution, take any of the following actions against a business license (which may include each line of business of the taxpayer): 
(1)  Suspend the then-current business license for a period not to exceed 12 months, and if the then-current license is to expire before the end of the suspension period, the renewal of the license shall be held in abeyance until the expiration of the suspension period. The city council may also suspend a business license for any business in which all or any of the principals of the affected taxpayer is also a principal. At the end of the suspension period the then-current license shall be automatically reinstated; provided, however, if the license has expired during the suspension period and is up for renewal, the license may be processed for renewal in accordance with this article. 
(2)  Revoke the then-current business license for up to a 36-month period. The city council may also revoke a business license for any business in which all or any of the principals of the affected taxpayer is also a principal.

If the city tax administrator determines that the amount of any business license tax reported on or remitted with a business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the city tax administrator to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the city tax administrator may calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable. The city tax administrator may thereafter enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalty and interest. Nothing contained herein shall limit or restrict the city's right to seek injunctive relief under Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 11-51-150 et seq.

In the event any of the following occurs: (1) the amount of the license tax reported on a return is undisputed by the city tax administrator; (2) the taxpayer consents in writing to any deficiency; or (3) the taxpayer consents in writing to the amount of the preliminary assessment, then the city tax administrator may, immediately enter a final assessment for the amount of the tax due, plus any applicable penalty and interest.

c.  A preliminary assessment may be entered within five years from the due date of the license form, or five years from the date the form is filed, whichever is later, if the taxpayer or its authorized agent fails or refuses to execute and return to the city clerk a written extension of the statute of limitations on issuing preliminary assessments for up to eight months, as requested by the city clerk, within 30 days after receipt of the request for extension by the taxpayer or its authorized agent. 
(3)  The preliminary assessment entered by the city tax administrator, or a copy thereof, shall promptly upon entry be mailed by the city tax administrator to the taxpayer's last known mailing address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, but at the option of the city tax administrator, the preliminary assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(d)  Petition for review of preliminary assessment; entry of final assessment. 
(1)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the city tax administrator, the taxpayer may file a petition for review with the city tax administrator, within 30 days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment.

(2)  If a petition for review: 
a.  Is not timely filed; or 
b.  Is timely filed, and upon further review the city tax administrator determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the city tax administrator may make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the city tax administrator, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. The city tax administrator shall, whenever practicable, complete his review of the taxpayer's petition for review and applicable law within 90 days following the later of the date of filing of the petition or the conference, if any. 
(3)  The final assessment entered by the city tax administrator , or a copy thereof, shall promptly upon entry be mailed to the taxpayer's last known mailing address:

If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the city tax administrator, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment has been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the petition for refund. 
(2)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the city tax administrator within a) three years from the date that the business license form was filed, or b) two years from the date of payment of the business license tax which is the subject of the petition, whichever is later, or if no form was timely filed, two years from the date of payment of the business license tax.

Secs. 15-7715-81. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 5. - COMPUTATION OF TAX; CLASSIFICATIONS; SCHEDULES 
 
Sec. 15-82. - Computation of license fee based on gross receipts. 
(a)  Computation. In the case of business licenses computed on the basis of gross receipts, the method for computing the license fee shall be as follows: 
(1)  For the initial business license, taxpayer shall make a good-faith estimate of the total amount of gross receipts it expects for the remainder of the calendar year, which shall be referred to as the "short year." The initial business license payment shall be based on this estimated amount. When the taxpayer next renews the business license, the estimated amount for the initial business license shall be compared to the taxpayer's actual gross receipts in the short year, and the amount for the initial license shall be adjusted accordingly, with the taxpayer owing at the time of such renewal any deficient amounts, or alternatively obtaining a credit for any overpayment. The basis for the license tax in the short year shall be the actual gross receipts for the short year. 
(2)  For the first renewal of the business license, the amount paid for the taxpayer's business license initially shall be based on an estimated full year's gross receipts, to be determined and adjusted utilizing the following procedure. The taxpayer shall project the first full year's gross receipts by annualizing the short year's gross receipts. This shall be done by dividing the number of full months the taxpayer was in business in the municipality or police jurisdiction into the short year's gross receipts and multiplying that amount by 12; provided that each taxpayer shall be deemed to have been in business in the municipality for a minimum of one month for purposes of this calculation. The initial amount levied on the taxpayer for this first renewal shall be based on this annualized projected amount, but the final levy shall be based on the actual gross receipts for that year. 
(3)  When the business license is renewed the following year after a full year of doing business, the amount paid in the previous year shall be adjusted to accord with the taxpayer's actual annual gross receipts, with the taxpayer owing at the time of such renewal any deficient amounts, or alternatively obtaining a credit for any overpayment for the previous year. 
(4)  In all subsequent years that the business license is renewed, the amount of business license owed shall be based on the gross receipts for the license year next preceding the current license year. 
(b)  Effect of applicable law. Where a business license tax is to be calculated based on gross receipts and applicable federal or state law requires that certain gross receipts be excluded from the calculation or where applicable federal or state law otherwise dictates how gross receipts are to be determined, for purposes of taxation under this article, it shall be the taxpayer's responsibility to properly make such exclusions or determinations based on applicable federal or state law. 
(c)  Payment protection. Any first time licensee or transient merchant may be required by the city to pay the business license fee and the issuance fee in cash or by certified check before a business license is issued. Any licensee who has paid the business license fee or issuance fee in prior years with financial instruments that were returned unpaid to the city by the financial institution on which drawn may be required by the city to pay the license fee and issuance fee in cash or by certified check before a business license is issued. 
(d)  Sworn statements required. Taxpayers shall be required to file with each renewal of a business license a sworn statement in accordance with section 15-73; provided, however, for licenses in the phase-in period that are based on estimated gross receipts, the taxpayer shall only be required to make an unsworn good faith effort to reasonably estimate the gross receipts. 
(Ord. No. 12-365, § 2, 5-24-2012)  
Sec. 15-83. - Branch office rules. 
A taxpayer required by this article to purchase a business license that is engaged in business in more than one municipality shall be permitted to account for its gross receipts so that the part of its gross receipts attributable to one or more branch offices will not be subject to the business license tax imposed on the principal business office required to obtain a business license. Branch office gross receipts are those receipts that are the result of business conducted at or from a qualifying branch office. In order to establish the existence of a qualifying branch office, the taxpayer shall meet all the following criteria: 
(1)  Demonstrate the continuing existence of an actual physical facility located outside the police jurisdiction of the municipality in which its principal business office is located, such as a retail store, outlet, business office, showroom, or warehouse, to which employees or independent contractors, or both, are assigned or located during regular normal working hours. 
(2)  Maintain books and records which reasonably indicate a segregation or allocation of the taxpayer's gross receipts to the particular facility or facilities. 
(3)  Provide reasonable proof that separate telephone listings, signs, or other indications of separate activity are in existence. 
(4)  Billing or collection activities, or both, relating to the business conducted at the branch office or offices are performed by an employee or other representative of the taxpayer who has such responsibility for the branch office, whether or not the representative is physically located at the branch office. 
(5)  All business claimed by a branch office or offices must be conducted by and through the office or offices. 
(6)  Supply proof that all applicable business licenses, as that term is defined by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-90.1, with respect to the branch office or offices have been issued.

Sec. 15-84. - Delivery license. 
(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for $100.00 plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the city if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the city; 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the city other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite set-up and installation of said merchandise; 
(3)  Such delivery and set-up and installation is performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in the city, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the taxpayer; 
(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed $75,000.00 during the license year; 
(5)  Any set-up or installation shall relate only to that required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state or local law, and the merchandise so delivered; 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above stated criteria, then within the ten days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase all appropriate business licenses from the city for the entire license year and without regard to this section. 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the city to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the city using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(e)  The purchase of a delivery license shall not, in and of itself, establish a nexus between the taxpayer and the city for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of Code of Ala. 1975, Title 40 or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that a nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the city.

State Law reference Citations, Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-45-9.1.  
Sec. 17-6. - Graffiti. 
(a)  Intent. Graffiti on private or public property is a blighting factor which deteriorates property and depreciates the value of the property and of adjacent and surrounding properties. The city council finds that graffiti or related inscribed material is a public nuisance and recognizes that it is done without the permission of the property owner and constitutes an act of vandalism, and is criminal activity under state law. It is the city council's further intent to provide for the prohibition of the placement of graffiti on public or private property as set forth in this section. Graffiti is inconsistent with the city's aesthetic standards and is injurious to the comfort, welfare and safety of the community. The existence of graffiti tends to breed community discontent and further criminal activity. The prompt removal of graffiti is necessary to prevent its proliferation, and failure to promptly remove or obscure graffiti increases the likelihood and probability that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby property. While a property and its owner or possessor are usually victims of the graffiti, it is always the duty of the owner or possessor of the property to remove graffiti immediately. To assist in preventing and controlling the spread of graffiti, the city council authorizes the use of city funds to remove graffiti on public and private property as set forth in this section. The council does not intend for this section to conflict with any existing state law. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Code officer means an officer or employee of the code enforcement section of the community development division of the city.

Graffiti nuisance means any graffiti that has not been immediately removed or otherwise abated by the owner or responsible party of the property. 
Manager means the manager of the community development division of the city or his designee or representative.

It shall be unlawful for an owner or responsible party to allow graffiti to remain on his property or to fail, neglect or refuse to immediately remove or abate any graffiti from his property.

Upon notification by an owner or responsible party, community development shall notify the gang task force, or other appropriate contact, within the criminal investigation division of the police department, which shall record all reports of graffiti for investigation and reference purposes. If the owner or responsible party notifies community development as provided in this subsection, such owner or responsible party shall be allowed 14 days from the date of such notification to abate the graffiti nuisance, using whatever resources may be available for graffiti abatement through community development. Should the owner or responsible party fail, neglect or refuse to remove or abate the graffiti from the property within the 14 days provided in this subsection, the owner or responsible party shall be issued a notice from community development to abate the graffiti as provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section.

This notice shall contain the street address or location of the property, a statement that the property is a graffiti nuisance, a concise description of the conditions that render the property a graffiti nuisance, and a statement that the graffiti nuisance must be abated by removal within a time as specified in the notice. The notice shall advise the owner or responsible party that if the graffiti nuisance is not abated within the allowed time, the city may enter the property and abate the graffiti nuisance and assess the costs of abatement to the property owner or responsible party and cause a citation to the municipal court to be issued for a violation of this section. The notice shall also advise that the owner or responsible party may request an appeal hearing as set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section, and shall name the date, time and place for the hearing. 
(3)  Appeal hearing. An owner or responsible party receiving a notice may request an administrative hearing before the community development manager, or other hearing officer as designated by the community development manager, to determine whether the owner or responsible party is in violation of this section. The community development manager and the owner or responsible party shall have the right to compel attendance of witnesses on their behalf at such hearing. If after the hearing the community development manager determines that this section has been violated, the owner or responsible party shall have five days from the date of notification of the determination to comply with this section. If the owner or responsible party fails, neglects or refuses to comply after such notification, the community development manager may institute the following enforcement procedures: 
a.  The community development manager may cause the abatement of the graffiti nuisance by removing or obscuring the graffiti. An account of the costs of the abatement shall be kept by the community development manager. Costs may include but are not limited to costs incurred in inspecting the property, in documenting the nuisance, in preparation of notices, work orders, and abatement contracts, and in inspection of the abatement work, in legal expenses, and other expenses. A billing notice of the expenses incurred by the city for the graffiti abatement may be served upon the owner or responsible party by certified mail or by personal delivery. The billing notice shall include the street address or location of the property where the abatement occurred and a statement of the expenses incurred by the city for abating the nuisance on the subject property and requiring that the expenses be paid to the city within 30 days from the date of the billing notice, or an assessment may be placed against the subject property. If the expenses are not paid within the allotted time, the community development manager may render an itemized report in writing to the city council setting forth the costs for abating the graffiti nuisance and requesting that an assessment be placed against the subject property. The community development manager shall notify the owner or responsible party at least five days in advance of the time fixed for the council to receive the report, and the owner or responsible party may appear at that time and present any objections to the report. At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the council shall hear the report, along with any objections which may be raised by the owner or responsible party whose property is liable to be assessed for the abatement. The council may make such modifications to the report as they deem necessary, after which by motion or resolution the report shall be confirmed. The amounts set forth in the report shall constitute special assessments against the subject property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessments. After confirmation of the report, a copy shall be given to the city clerk-treasurer, who is charged with the collection of assessments, whereupon it shall be the duty of the city clerk-treasurer to charge the assessments against the respective property; and thereafter the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal assessments are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedures under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal assessments. 
b.  The community development manager, or any code officer, may cause a citation to be issued to any owner or responsible party who, after written notice has been issued, fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of this section. Such citation shall name the party charged, the address or location of the property where the graffiti nuisance is located, and the nature of the offense or violation. It shall also apprise the responsible party of the date, time and place at which to appear for court. Such citation shall be returnable to the municipal court. 
c.  The community development manager may institute both enforcement procedures set forth in subsections (d)(3)a. and b. of this section. 
(e)  Emergency removal. If the community development manager or any code officer determines that any graffiti is an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of the public, then 48 hours after the notice is posted on a conspicuous place on the property, the city may remove or cause the graffiti to be removed. 
(f)  Right of entry. The community development manager, or any code officer, is authorized to enter upon any property within the city for the purpose of enforcing this section, or for the purpose of abating a graffiti nuisance. 
(g)  Materials. In no case shall the city be required to paint or repair any more extensive an area than that where graffiti is located, or is necessary to remove or abate the graffiti, as determined by community development. The city shall not be required to restore the property to its original condition with regards to color, texture or type material used for abatement. 
(h)  Penalty. Any owner or responsible party of a graffiti nuisance property who violates this section by allowing graffiti to remain upon the property shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 upon conviction in the municipal court.

Sec. 17-8. - Discontinuance of CATV service. 
(a)  No franchised cable TV provider of the city shall disconnect or discontinue basic subscriber service to any subscriber, solely on the basis that the subscriber has refused the provider entry into the living area of the residential subscriber; however, such service may be discontinued after notification by the franchise holder to both the subscriber and to the city clerk-treasurer and after a hearing by the city council if the provider shows that there is reasonable grounds for such entry and that entry has been denied. 
(b)  Reasonable grounds shall include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Reasonable suspicion that the operation of a subscriber's equipment and attached to the franchise holder's cable is causing interference which places the franchise holder in potential violation of FCC regulations.

This provision shall not apply where there is an immediate danger to public safety because of the connection.

Such notice shall be conclusively presumed to have been given when the notice is deposited with the United States Postal Service and addressed to such holder at the address shown upon the membership records of the library. 
(e)  This section shall apply only to offenses where the borrowing or withdrawal of the book, periodical, recording or other material actually occurred entirely within the city, it not being within the authority of the city council to create an offense for an act occurring entirely outside the city.

Note: The discharge of industrial waste only will be reported. This may be arrived at by metering or by agreement between a representative of the engineering division and the firm concerned. If the total water supply for the firm is furnished by the City of Huntsville, water used for purposes other than for treatment of industrial waste will not be reported under the industrial waste discharge. If the source of water supply for processing industrial waste is obtained from a source other than from the city water department, this volumetric discharge will be considered as a supplement to water furnished by the city, will be metered, and will be reported in industrial waste discharge. 
(Code 1982, § 20-172)  
Sec. 21-153. - Permit where no pretreatment required. 
For those applicants for which no pretreatment is required for the waste to be discharged into the city sewer from the premises desiring service, if the engineering division determines that the capacity of the available existing city mains and treatment plant facilities are sufficient to accommodate the applicant's waste, upon the applicant's providing a proper connection from his plant or premises to the city sewer, the engineering division will issue the applicant a permit to discharge waste connection and permit the applicant to discharge waste from such premises into the city sewer at the rate and in the quantities stated. Upon receipt of such permit, the applicant will thereafter be charged by the city at the rates established by ordinance for the taking and disposing of such waste. 
(Code 1982, § 20-173)  
Sec. 21-154. - Chemical analysis required. 
Any person now discharging or desiring to discharge industrial waste into the sanitary sewer system shall submit with his application to the approving authority a complete chemical analysis of the waste being discharged or proposed to be discharged, including concentrations of BOD and suspended solids contained in such discharges. Such person shall also submit pertinent flow data, including rates and duration, and description of his operation. Should the waste from such person's operations be deemed to be inadmissible into the sanitary sewer system because of objectionable character as defined by this division, because of concentrations of elements or substances in excess of the limits established by the approving authority, or because of flow characteristics incompatible with the best use of the receiving sewer, the approving authority will not approve the discharge of such waste into the sanitary sewer system until such person has employed, at his own expense, methods and processes for pretreatment as will render the waste admissible to the sanitary sewer system in accordance with this division. 
(Code 1982, § 20-174; Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-155. - Approval of discharge. 
The approving authority will not specify, suggest or recommend equipment, structures or arrangements comprising the pretreatment processes. Approval of discharge of industrial waste by any person will be given only on the basis of performance of pretreatment processes, if pretreatment should be required. Approval given to any person for discharge of industrial waste, whether pretreated or not, into the sanitary sewer system shall in no way relieve such person of the responsibility for full compliance with this division at all times. 
(Code 1982, § 20-175; Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-156. - Acid or alkaline range. 
No wastewater which for any sustained period shows an acid or alkaline reaction outside of the recommended pH range (i.e., less than six or more than nine) shall be placed in the sanitary sewer system. Wastewater outside of these limits may be chemically adjusted, and the process used shall be at the option of the producer. It shall also be the responsibility of the producer to design, operate and maintain the pretreatment plant and demonstrate its effective use to the satisfaction of the engineering division. The continuous operation and maintenance of the plant with consistent results will be the responsibility of the producer, even though the pretreatment plans have been approved by the director. Dilution, in no way, will be accepted as a form of pretreatment except and only then when duly authorized by the engineering division, AWIC and/or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
(Code 1982, § 20-176; Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-157. - Connection charge determination. 
After issuance of the required permit under this division, the industrial waste disposal connection charge will be made as provided for completion connection charge and billing with water service. 
(Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-158. - Effect of approvals. 
Any approval by the engineering division of a type, kind or capacity of an installation shall not relieve a person of the responsibility of revamping, enlarging or otherwise modifying such installation to accomplish an intended purpose; nor shall any fixed or oral agreement as to limits of constituents or volumes of waters or wastes be considered as final approval for continuing operation. These limits will be subject to constant study and change as considered necessary to serve their intended purpose. 
(Code 1982, § 20-177)  
Sec. 21-159. - Property rights. 
The issuance of a permit by the engineering division does not convey any property rights in either real or personal property, or any exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any injury to private property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any infringement of federal, state or local laws or regulations. 
(Code 1982, § 20-178)  
Sec. 21-160. - Ownership changes. 
If a property or plant authorized to make a connection to the city sewer for industrial waste disposal under the provisions of this article is sold, leased or its operation is assumed or taken over by a person other than that named in the permit, a new application or permit will be made by the new owner, lessee or operator. No permit issued under the provisions of this division shall be assignable to any other persons to exercise the privileges and receive the benefits of such permit, and a violation of the provisions of this article shall be grounds for summary cancellation of such permit by the director. 
(Code 1982, § 20-179)  
Sec. 21-161. - Due date; amount of fees. 
(a)  Industrial waste permits shall be due on January 1 in three-year intervals and shall be delinquent on the following February 1. 
(b)  Applicants shall pay a fee of $15.00 for the first permit issued and a renewal fee of $15.00. If the permit fee becomes delinquent, there shall be added a penalty of $15.00. If a permit is canceled for cause under the provisions of this division by the engineering division, a fee of $45.00 shall be payable for a subsequent initial permit issued to such applicant on completion by the applicant of forms provided and their approval. 
(Code 1982, § 20-180; Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-162. - Permit cancellation. 
The engineering division is authorized to cancel any permit issued under the provisions of this division and terminate such service at any time that an applicant violates any of the provisions of this article or other ordinances of the city pertaining to wastewater disposal into city sewers by such plant; or should the applicant fail or refuse to pay, when due, charges made by the city for such sewer service; or should the applicant discharge waste at a rate, or in a quantity or strength or other quality in excess of that provided for by the permit or of a quality violating the permit or prohibited by this article or other related city ordinance. Such cancellation shall be subject to review as provided for. 
(Code 1982, § 20-181)  
Sec. 21-163. - Conflicts with state and federal laws. 
(a)  Where conflicts exist between city and state or federal regulations, the more stringent requirement shall apply. In all cases where limits have not been specifically determined in this article, the more stringent of state or federal regulations shall apply. 
(b)  Within nine months of the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the industrial waste permit of users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the timeframe prescribed by the standard, except when the state and/or city pretreatment standards are more stringent than the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
(Ord. No. 81-192, § 9, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-164. - Monthly reports. 
Any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the engineering division a monthly report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated wastestream and the average daily flow rate of the discharge. This monthly self-monitoring report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 
(Ord. No. 81-192, § 10, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-165. - Confidential information. 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications and monitoring shall be available to the public or governmental agency without restriction unless the user requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the engineering division that the release would divulge processes or methods entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(Ord. No. 81-192, § 11, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-166. - Treatment credits. 
Where the POTW achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city or an industrial user may apply to the AWIC for modification of specific limits in the standards. After sufficient analytical proof of consistent removal is obtained (the cost of which can, at the option of the city, be borne by the industrial user), the city may then modify that pollutant discharge limits if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and with prior AWIC approval obtained. 
(Ord. No. 81-192, § 12, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-167. - FDF variances. 
FDF (fundamentally different factors) variances, referred to in section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act of 1977, are allowances in which an industrial user can present information and data to the EPA and the AWIC which verify that the user's particular process is different, fundamentally, from others in his pretreatment category and thus different from those factors which were used to develop the categorical pretreatment standards for that group. These are case-by-case adjustments which can make the standards more or less stringent and approval for such requests is reserved for the EPA. The written submission, however, is handled by the AWIC and should have certain content and be in acceptable form. This information as well as essential qualifications for approval and other aspects of the FDF variance are available from the AWIC upon request. The city reserves the right to comment on FDF variance applications submitted by its industrial users.

Secs. 21-16821-190. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 6. - INDUSTRIAL SURCHARGES 
 
Sec. 21-191. - Definition; amount of charges. 
Industrial waste is considered any effluent with pollutant loadings in excess of the following maxima during a 24-hour average for a billing period. Industrial surcharges shall apply as follows: 
(1)  BOD 5 In excess of 250 ppm, $0.17 per pound. 
(2)  SSIn excess of 250 ppm, $0.12 per pound. 
(Code 1982, § 20-191; Ord. No. 00-129, § 2, 3-9-2000)  
Sec. 21-192. - Computation of pounds. 
(a)  Pounds shall be computed by 8.34 (the weight of one gallon of water), times the volume of the wastewater in million gallons, times the parts per million in excess of normal strength. (P = 8.34 × MGD × PPM) 
(b)  Alternatively, pounds shall be computed by 0.00624 pound, the conversion factor to determine the weight in pounds of one mg/l for a volume in hundreds of cubic feet, times the volume of wastewater in hundreds of cubic feet, times the parts per million in excess of normal strength. 
(Code 1982, § 20-192)  
Sec. 21-193. - High concentrations of pollutants. 
At the discretion of the director, on a case-by-case basis, high concentrations of specific pollutants will warrant a surcharge based upon the higher cost of treatment of the discharge. 
(Code 1982, § 20-193)  
Secs. 21-19421-210. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 7. - PROHIBITED DISCHARGES 
 
Sec. 21-211. - Generally. 
(a)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. 
(b)  In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes or more than five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation that will interfere with the operation of the POTW. 
(Code 1982, § 20-201; Ord. No. 81-192, 6-25-1981)  
Sec. 21-212. - Substances prohibited in public sewers. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following waters or wastes into any public sewers: 
(1)  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(2)  a.  Any water or waste which may contain more than 100 ppm, by weight, of fats, oil or grease, or any water or waste containing oil, grease, or other substance that will solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. 
b.  As set forth in sections 21-15421-156, minimal pretreatment of wastes containing concentrations of grease (i.e., animal and vegetable fats and oils) in excess of 75 ppm is required. 
c.  Such minimal pretreatment requires passage through a grease trap meeting the city's engineering standards and providing a minimum retention time of ten minutes between influent and effluent battles with 20 percent of the total volume as allowance for a sludge pocket. This sludge pocket should be kept reasonably free of inorganic solids, and all grease and other floating materials shall be skimmed from the tank at sufficiently frequent intervals to avoid reduction of efficiency of the trap. 
d.  Upon written notification by the director that a grease trap is required for a given discharge, the user will have a period of 90 days for compliance. Such compliance consists of the complete installation and operability of a grease trap approved by the director. Failure to comply will result in the implementation of the enforcement procedures of division 2 of this article. Grease traps shall be available for inspection by the director or his staff at all reasonable times. 
(3)  Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, mineral spirits, commercial solvent, motor oil or other flammable or explosive liquid, or any other petroleum derivative. 
(4)  Any waters or wastes that contain more than ten ppm by weight of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide or nitrous oxide. 
(5)  Any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, offal, plastics, wood, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails, lime residues, beer or distillery slops, chemical residues, fiberglass, paint or ink residues, cannery waste, bulk solids or any other solid or viscous substance capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the wastewater works without proper pretreatment and written approval of the director. 
(6)  Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than six or higher than nine at any time, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment or personnel of the wastewater works, or the treatment process. 
(7)  a.  Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous substances in such concentration as to constitute a hazard to humans or animals, or to interfere with any wastewater treatment process, or to create any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant without proper pretreatment and written approval of the director. 
b.  These limits may be used as a guide in design and plant control, but may be altered by the director as required or authorized by state or federal law in the event of a cumulative overload on a particular drainage basin or wastewater treatment plant. 
(8)  Any waters containing suspended solids of such character and quantity that unusual provision, attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the wastewater treatment plant. 
(9)  Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance, capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or preventing entry into sewers for their maintenance, inspection and repair. 
(10)  Any waters containing quantities of radium, naturally occurring, or artificially produced radioisotopes in excess of presently existing or subsequently accepted limits for drinking water as established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measuring. 
(11)  Any concentrated dye wastes, spent tanning solutions or other wastes which are highly colored, or wastes which are of unusual volume, concentration of solids or composition that may create obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the proper operation and treatment of influent of the wastewater works without proper pretreatment and written approval of the director. 
(12)  Any waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment to only such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(13)  Any water or waste containing more than 2,000 ppm total solids. 
(14)  Any wastes at a flow rate and/or pollutant discharge rate which is excessive over a short period of time so that there is a treatment process overload and subsequent loss of treatment efficiency. 
(15)  Any wastewater containing phenols or other taste-producing substances in such concentrations as to produce odor in the effluent as to affect the taste or odor of the receiving water. Quantities of such substances will be determined by the director on a case-by-case basis. 
(b)  No person may discharge into grinder pumps or operate grinder pumps in any manner which is not recommended by the equipment manufacturer.

(a)  No permit for the disposal of industrial waste will be approved by the director which will permit the acceptance of waste which will damage either the sewers, plants or appurtenances of the sewer system or produce results detrimental to the treatment process, including sludge disposal, or producing plant effluent contrary to the rules and standards set out by the local, state and federal agencies having jurisdiction. 
(b)  No waste shall be placed in the sanitary sewer system and no permit will be approved for acceptance of any waste which will produce damage or stoppage to the sewers of the city system. No waste shall be placed in the sanitary sewer system except by appropriate permit from the director, and no industrial waste shall be placed in any city sewer system or sanitary sewer system without an industrial waste disposal permit issued by the director. 
(Code 1982, § 20-220)  
Sec. 21-244. - Acceptance of waste. 
(a)  Wastes will be accepted which have been placed in satisfactory conditions or quality after pretreatment by the producer in a plant or by a process which has been approved by the director, and which is continuously maintained and operated by the producer at no cost to the city and which is continuously subject to inspection by the director or his designated representative. The construction plans for such pretreatment plants shall, after their approval, be placed on file in permanent reproducible form with the director without cost to the city. 
(b)  Septic tank waste will be received by the city only at the disposal site located at treatment plant No. 1, on Vermont Road. 
(Code 1982, § 20-221)  
Sec. 21-245. - Quality determination. 
(a)  Determination of the average concentration or strength of the waste delivered shall be the obligation of the city. Tests made on representative average samples collected by the city shall be made at intervals as the city may desire so long as at least annual samples are taken. 
(b)  Samples may be taken and tests made at the city's option without notice to the owner and test results made and approved by the city shall be final in fixing the applicable rate. However, the owner may request in writing that parallel sampling and tests at all times be made by the owner and the city, in which case consideration may be given to using the average of comparable values obtained by the owner and the city. 
(Code 1982, § 20-222)  
Sec. 21-246. - Testing wastes. 
It is specifically agreed by the producer that the city may at any time test any of the waste being discharged by the company for quality or quantity, and a duly authorized city representative may enter a plant at any time by appropriate application at the plant office during business or operational hours for this purpose or for checking company operation to estimate the quantity and quality of waste. 
(Code 1982, § 20-223)  
Sec. 21-247. - Effluent sampling. 
(a)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," 20th edition, published by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association, and the Water Environment Federation, and/or "Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes," U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460, which publications shall be on file in the office of the city clerk-treasurer and be available for use and examination by the public in that office at all reasonable times; and all such measurements, tests and analyses shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. If no special manhole has been installed, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater works and to determine the existence of hazards of life, limb and property. 
(b)  The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of the premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(c)  The increased charge or surcharge, as specified in division 6 of this article for sewer and industrial waste which exceeds the standard quality set out in this division, is used to provide for the increased costs, which costs vary with both quality and quantity when waste is treated. The variations in cost with strengths are admittedly difficult to exactly determine, and the method is to be effective without reference to other possible methods of computation. This provision shall not alter any of the terms and provisions of this article. 
(Code 1982, § 20-224)  
Sec. 21-248. - Quality changes. 
The director shall have made from time to time tests to determine the quality of waste being discharged into the city sewer from users or connectors, including the premises or industrial waste disposal permit holders under the provisions of this article. If at any time such waste becomes or the industrial process changes to a quality that requires pretreatment according to the city standards, the director shall have the authority to require that proper permits be obtained and proper pretreatment facilities be installed by the permit holder. Should any user or connector, or a permit holder, fail or refuse to install such facilities or initiate the installation to the satisfaction and approval of the director within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the director, the director (subject to review as provided in this article) shall have the authority to revoke such permit and to terminate sewer service to such premises until such time as there has been compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(Code 1982, § 20-225)  
Sec. 21-249. - Quantity determination. 
(a)  Unless otherwise provided, the quantity of waste delivered to city sewers will be used as the same as the water delivered to the producer by the city water system; if well water is to be used, it must be known to the city and metered at the user's expense, using a metering device which meets the city's engineering standards. The user shall pay the city the cost incurred in meter reading and billing. Such metering devices will be accessible to authorized city representatives at all reasonable times. 
(b)  Should the producer evaporate or dispose of water delivered by the city water system, it shall be the obligation of the producer to install such meters or other devices to determine the portion of quantity delivered to the sewer system. 
(c)  The director will consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the city in order to determine the waste delivered by the industry. Determination of this factor will be the responsibility of the waste producer as also will be the demonstration to obtain the director's approval of the factor. The value of this factor will be periodically reviewed for accuracy.

Sec. 21-282. - Sewer access fees. 
(a)  Purpose. Heretofore, extensions and improvements to the city sanitary sewer system necessary to accommodate the collection and transportation of new and expanded sanitary sewage discharges, or flows, to city sanitary sewage treatment facilities have been made from the sanitary sewer system extension fund, created from payments made by all system rate payers, or as a result of agreements and negotiations by the city with private sources benefited by such extensions and improvements. It is the purpose of this section to create a policy whereby some portion, not exceeding the actual costs of such extensions and improvements, is collected as new and additional discharges, or flows, are established. In a general way, this section begins to create a policy whereby, through the adjustment of the rates herein established, new development or growth creating new flows into the sanitary sewer system will bear a substantial portion of the costs to the city of improvements and extensions made necessary by new development and growth. It is anticipated that from time to time the city council will review and adjust this policy to achieve the purpose herein stated. 
(b)  There is hereby established with respect to the sanitary sewer system of the city, a schedule of charges for new or expanded discharges, or flows, into the system, to be known as new discharge access fees. The amount of such fees shall be based upon the new or added water meter size, as follows: 
SEWER ACCESS FEES 
New or Additional 
Water Meter Size 	Fee 
¾" 	$1,000.00 
1" 	 1,500.00 
1½" 	 2,000.00 
2" 	 3,000.00 
3" 	 4,000.00 
4" or above 	 6,000.00 
 
(c)  There is hereby created an account to be known as the sanitary sewer system access fund. The proceeds collected by the city inspection department from the charges herein required shall be paid into the sanitary sewer system access fund account, to be appropriated and used solely to pay city costs for improvements and extensions to the system made necessary to accommodate the collection and transportation of new and expanded discharges, or flows, into the system. 
(d)  No entitlement created. This section is not intended to change any existing policy, or create any entitlement. The city will continue to, and reserves the right to, evaluate sanitary sewer collection extensions and improvements based upon economic feasibility, and to negotiate agreements with persons benefited on a case by case basis.

(1)  The owner or person in possession of any household, business, industry or other property in the city may store, haul and dispose of acceptable waste generated, occurring or accumulated upon the premises of such person (not including, however, any acceptable waste previously collected by any such person from the premises of others, notwithstanding that title to such waste may have been transferred to such person) on his own land or otherwise, if such storage, haulage or disposal is accomplished pursuant to a certificate of exception obtained under the provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, § 22-27-3(e); 
(2)  Any person owning or being in charge or possession of any private residence, commercial business or industry may remove and transport acceptable waste generated or occurring upon the premises of such person provided such acceptable waste is delivered to the authority for disposal as and to the same extent required and provided in this section with respect to private collectors or haulers collecting and removing acceptable waste under licenses granted by the city; and 
(3)  Any acceptable waste that is appropriately delivered or tendered to the authority as provided in this section and that the authority does not accept, process or otherwise dispose of, may thereafter be delivered and disposed of in any lawful manner deemed desirable by the licensed private collector or hauler or other person collecting or transporting the waste, it being understood and agreed that, for purposes of the preceding portions of this subsection (b)(3), the authority shall be considered not to have accepted, processed or otherwise disposed of any such acceptable waste only if such acceptable waste shall have been duly and appropriately tendered to the authority, in accordance with its rules and regulations, at an authorized receiving facility and the authority shall have rejected or otherwise failed to accept it, or the authority shall have published in a newspaper having general circulation and published in the city a notice to the effect that it cannot accept any acceptable waste and shall not have revoked or otherwise withdrawn (by notice published in like manner) such notice.

Extra work is defined as the extension of sanitary sewer lines, the replacement of dilapidated utility lines, and all off-site work outside of the boundaries defined in subsection (1)c of this section. 
c.  Assessment boundaries will be limited to the lots or tracts of land abutting the streets improved, and which benefit from the improvement. All assessments will be apportioned along the abutting property based upon frontage but no assessment will be more than the increased value of the assessed property due to the improvement. Increased value will be determined prior to project approval, and the project shall not be commenced except upon approval of 51 percent of the owners as to the increased value. 
d.  All projects shall be designed and constructed by the department of public works services or by contract entered into between the city and the lowest bidder. 
(2)  Prioritization procedure. 
a.  In order to be considered for curb and gutter improvements, a written request must be submitted to the department of public works services. This request must contain the limits of desired improvements, statement of intent to waive all objections to assessment costs, and a petition signed by all affected property owners within the improvement limits. 
b.  All projects to be considered shall terminate at street intersections. 
c.  All requests shall be rated by the department of public works services prior to October 1 of each fiscal year in order to be considered for the following fiscal year. 
d.  The city council will determine, after required legal advertising and hearings, whether or not to proceed with the assessment. Funds for improvements may be advanced by the city from municipal funds, or may be provided by long-term borrowing. Assessments shall be payable annually over a period of ten years or less at the legal rate chargeable by the city for public improvement assessments.

In blocks or equivalent space longer than 750 feet which is not intersected by a street, if extended the total length of space divided by 50 shall be used to determine the feet of frontage assigned to each number. 
(b)  Where blocks of different lengths occur on opposite sides of a street, the numbers on both sides shall be assigned on the basis of the shorter blocks unless the city engineer determines otherwise. 
(c)  All lots and houses on the right side proceeding from the base line shall be even numbers; all lots and houses on the left side proceeding from the base line shall be odd numbers, each commencing with the hundred assigned to that block, and shall increase from the base line number for each 15 feet of frontage, except as provided in this section. Where any building has more than one door serving separate occupants, a separate number shall be assigned to each door serving a separate occupant, providing the building is 15 feet or more in width. If the building is not 15 feet or more in width and the entrances are not that far apart, the next consecutive number shall be marked fractional. Buildings fronting on two or more streets shall have a number assigned only to the main entrance unless other entrances serve different occupants.

Sec. 23-231. - Requirement; event cancellation; lease events; sound events; extended events. 
(a)  Permit requirement . Except for minor events, all organized events conducted on a public area shall be required to obtain a special event permit. No person shall knowingly participate in a special event for which an event permit is required under this article unless an event permit has been issued for the event. 
(b)  Event cancellation or delay . In order to prevent the unnecessary tying up of public space or city event services for a special event that does not occur as scheduled, each of the following shall apply: 
(1)  Cancellation or delay of basic events and enhanced events . 
a.  Basic events . The organizer of a permitted special event that is a basic event shall provide to the event administrator: (i) at least 24 hours' advance notice of a delay of more than one hour in the start time of the event on any given day of the event, and (ii) at least 48 hours' advance notice of a cancellation of the event, which, in the case of a multiple day event, means 48 hours' notice in advance of the day on which the event will not occur, if the event is not entirely cancelled. 
b.  Enhanced events . The organizer of a permitted special event that is an enhanced event shall provide to the event administrator: (i) at least 48 hours of a delay of more than one hour in the start time of the event on any given day of the event, and (ii) at least five business days advance notice of a cancellation of the event, which, in the case of a multiple day event, means five business days notice in advance of the day on which the event will not occur, if the event is not entirely cancelled. 
c.  Event canceled . Unless the organizer has provided the required advance notice in accordance with the immediately foregoing subsections (1)a. and b., where no participants have arrived or event set-up started at the location or starting point of a basic event or enhanced event within two hours after its scheduled starting time for any given day of the event, the event shall be deemed to have been canceled and the permit surrendered for the remainder of the event. In the case of multiple day events whose permit has been deemed surrendered, the event administrator may, upon the request of the event organizer, reinstate the permit provided that the request is made at least 20 hours before the next scheduled start time for the event and further provided that the required city event services, if any, and the public space are available. 
d.  Permit denial . Failure of the same event or event organizer to provide the required advance notice of cancellation of an event three or more times within the same calendar year shall constitute grounds for denying a subsequent event permit application made during the same year for the same event organizer or same event. 
e.  Reimbursement for services . Where city event services have been assigned to a special event that has been canceled by the organizer without the required advance notice, the organizer shall reimburse the city upon invoicing for costs incurred, if any, for city event services in excess of the standard complement. 
f.  Weather events, etc . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection (1), where the delay or cancellation of an event is necessary because of a potentially hazardous weather event or other situation beyond the organizer's control that is likely to pose a risk to public safety, then the organizer shall be required to provide notice of the delay or cancellation of the event as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances. 
g.  Delayed events . Events that are delayed in starting on a given day shall still end at the time stated in the permit, unless the event administrator reasonably determines that the event can end later to make up for the delay in the start time. 
(2)  Cancellation of permitted minor events . With regard to a minor event that has obtained a permit, where no participants have arrived or event set-up started at the location or starting point of the event within two hours after its scheduled starting time, the permit shall be deemed to have been surrendered for that day. The minor event may still be conducted on that day, but the event will have lost its prior use status under the permit for that day. 
(c)  Lease events . 
(1)  As a condition of event permitting, organizers for alcoholic beverage licensed events or for-profit events may be required to obtain a lease or license from the city for the use of the public space.

a.  Those organized events which involve the use of enhancements that pose an enhanced risk to public safety or damage to public property, including events that involve dangerous instrumentalities such as pyrotechnics; 
b.  Organized events that are anticipated to have in excess of 10,000 participants over the duration of the event; or 
c.  Multiple-day events that will not remove from the public area the event facilities or equipment. 
(3)  An event organizer that desires to have exclusive control or possession of public space upon which the event will be held may request a lease or license from the city, which the city is not obligated to grant. 
(4)  A lease or license event shall be subject to the provisions of this article including applicable permitting and, in addition, the city may impose additional requirements in the lease or license including insurance, the posting of security, and indemnification requirements. 
(5)  Leases or licenses for for-profit events may include use fees to be paid to the city by the event organizer for the use of the public space based on either a flat fee or percentage of gross event proceeds. 
(6)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this article, leases or licenses for for-profit events or alcoholic beverage licensed events may include provisions for cost recovery to be paid to the city for city event services. 
(7)  The issuance of a lease or license shall not convert the space from a traditional public forum. 
(d)  Sound events . 
(1)  Sound events are subject to the approval of the city's department of natural resources and event organizers shall be required to complete an application on forms provided by the city. The application will be processed by the department of natural resources in conjunction with the processing of the special permit application by the event administrator. 
(2)  In approving sound events the department of natural resources may consider, among other relevant considerations, the proposed time, location, and duration of the event; secondary harms; whether there is a more suitable alternative location or time for the event; the affect the sound levels would have on the ability of the city to conduct crowd control; the likely hardship on the successful conduct of the event if the sound event is not approved; the history of citizens' noise complaints for the same or substantially similar events or locations; and the decibel level likely to be generated by the event. 
(3)  In approving a sound event the department of natural resources may attach reasonable conditions which address the impact of the sound event, such as limiting the duration or time of the event, moving the event to a more suitable location or time, setting acceptable decibel levels for the event, and dictating the positioning and direction of the amplification equipment. 
(e)  Private events .

(f)  Extended events . Where an extended event is using the same or substantially similar public space that is a preferred location for another organized event and multiple events cannot reasonably be accommodated, the event administrator may apportion the time or public space between or among the organized events on an equitable basis, provided reasonable accommodation is made for the other event in reasonably close proximity to the preferred location.

(3)  In the case of minor events conducted on the sidewalk, as required of all organized event conducted on a sidewalk, minor events on a sidewalk shall be conducted generally at least ten feet apart from other organized events; provided, however, this separation requirement shall not prevent participants of other organized events when not actually participating in their own event from simply walking along that portion of the sidewalk left unencumbered by the minor sidewalk event. 
(4)  Participants in a minor event conducted on the streets or sidewalks shall proceed in an orderly fashion, observe all traffic signals when crossing a street, and otherwise obey the rules of the road, including, where applicable, Code of Ala. 1975, section 32-5A-215. 
(5)  Minor events conducted on the streets shall not have more than 25 vehicles at any one time during the conduct of the event.

(7)  Participants in a minor event shall use only the amount of public space reasonably necessary for the conduct of the event so that other minor events that want to hold an event in the same general area can be accommodated.

The city shall not provide as a part of the provisioning of city event services for an organized event under this article services for over-night security of an event site, gate security, security for monies or valuables, carting or hauling of waste, and other services which are typically available on a private contractual basis. This subsection (b)(2) shall not be construed to prevent an event organizer from hiring city personnel on an off-duty or extra duty basis to provide such services. 
(3)  Provisioning of city event services subject to availability . Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the provisioning of city event services, including the standard complement, shall be subject to the availability of such services for an event, including unavailability due to prior assignment, public emergency, equipment damage or repair, or scheduled maintenance. Where city event services, including the standard complement, are necessary for the conduct of the event but are unavailable, then the organizer of the special event may elect to modify the conduct of the event to eliminate the need for city event services, cancel the event, provide its own services subject to the approval of the police chief for public safety services, or reschedule the event to a time when city event services are available.

Prior to the commencement of the event, the event administrator will provide the organizer with an estimate of such costs; however, the city will not be bound by the estimate should it differ from the actual costs incurred by the city. In no case shall an event organizer be required to reimburse the city for the costs associated with providing city services based on the actual or anticipated conduct of nonparticipants. 
c.  Early application for enhanced events . Except for for-profit events, an organizer of an enhanced event will not be required to reimburse the city for city event services in excess of the standard complement if the organizer has filed a completed or conditional application at least 120 days prior to the date the proposed event is scheduled to commence. 
(5)  Where an event organizer desires city events services in excess of those suggested or required by the city based on the criteria set forth above in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the organizer shall be required to either, at the election of the event administrator, pre-pay the estimated costs of such services, which shall be adjusted as necessary once the actual costs have been determined, or reimburse the city for the actual costs of such services. 
(c)  Restoration reimbursement costs . 
(1)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, if the event organizer fails to perform the organizer's restoration responsibilities in accordance section 23-203(a)(2), the city may perform or have performed the restoration work and invoice the event organizer for the restoration reimbursement costs.

(2)  The event administrator shall consider the objection and provide a new invoice sustaining the original amount, or modifying or eliminating the charge based on the objection.

Such deposit, if required, must be required of all organizers of permitted events, or of only those event organizers which, in the past, have failed to perform their restoration responsibilities or have failed to pay restoration reimbursement costs to the city. 
(e)  Non-event costs . In no case shall an organizer be required to reimburse the city for the costs associated with providing city services that are assigned by the event administrator based on the anticipated or actual conduct of nonparticipants in the event. 
(f)  Invoicing . The city shall provide an itemized invoice for any reimbursements owed to the city under this article, which shall be paid by the responsible person by the date stated in the invoice.

b.  A prior use of some or all of the same public space or a public space in reasonably close proximity to the space; or 
c.  Unavailability because of fire, casualty, acts of nature, or public emergency. 
(4)  Non-curable secondary harms . The proposed conduct of the event would have secondary harms that cannot reasonably be cured, including unreasonable hardship to adjacent or nearby uses due to repeated or prolonged street closure; unreasonable interference with the use of the public space by other persons or organized events; or unreasonable demands on the city's resources because of unusual, extraordinary, or burdensome costs or expenses. 
(5)  Use of parks . The likely detrimental impact of the proposed event on the use and physical integrity of the park and its facilities or amenities taking into account such factors as: 
a.  The ability of the park to accommodate the conduct of the event; 
b.  The physical condition of the park; 
c.  The existence of reasonably available alternatives; 
d.  Conflicting uses of the park; 
e.  Secondary harms; or 
f.  The number of prior uses already scheduled for the park and the ability of the park to accommodate repeated uses without suffering material damage. 
(6)  Public safety . The proposed conduct of the event will be likely to have an impermissible impact upon public safety because it will: 
a.  Substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic in the area of its route or location and there are insufficient public safety services available at the time to mitigate the disruption; 
b.  Require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the area or route that will be occupied by the special event and contiguous areas so as to prevent normal police protection to the city; 
c.  Require the diversion of so great a number of ambulances and fire rescue units as to prevent normal ambulance and rescue service to portions of the city other than those areas or routes that will be occupied by the special event and contiguous areas; 
d.  Involve the concentration of persons, animals, floats, or vehicles at the assembly points of the event that will unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of or ambulance service to areas contiguous to such assembly areas; 
e.  Interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment en route to a fire; 
f.  Fail to provide proper sanitation services; or 
g.  Otherwise pose an unreasonable risk to the public safety. 
(7)  Major arterials . The location requested is for a street that is a major arterial within the city limits, unless the magnitude of the event requires it and such an event cannot reasonably be accommodated elsewhere. This subsection (7) shall not apply to processions that merely cross a major arterial and that are not otherwise prohibited according to the terms of this article. 
(c)  Alternative to denial . Should the event administrator have to deny a permit pursuant to this section and there are reasonable alternatives to the conduct of the event that are available and that would eliminate the basis for denial, the administrator shall propose the alternatives to the organizer who must accept those alternatives by providing a notice of its acceptance by the next business day following the organizer's receipt of the administrator's decision notice, otherwise the denial shall stand. 
(d)  Conditional approval . 
(1)  In the case of completed or conditional applications that have been filed more than 30 days in advance of the event, the event administrator may issue conditional approval for the event if the event is due to be approved except for one or more of the following pending items: 
a.  Action being taken with regard to required approval, licensing, or permitting pursuant to other city laws or laws administered by the health department, or except for required leasing of the public space; 
b.  Confirmation of the availability of city event services; or 
c.  Confirmation that the public area requested for the event has not been scheduled for a state or city public building or works project, including improvement or infrastructure maintenance, repair, or construction. 
(2)  Issuance of a conditional approval shall mean that, except for the pending items, there are no conditions that are known to exist that would constitute a ground for denying the permit. Nothing in this subsection (d) shall prevent the revocation of a permit in accordance with section 23-205. 
(Ord. No. 13-189, § 1, 5-9-2013)  
Sec. 23-238. - Appeal of denial. 
(a)  Right of appeal . An organizer denied a special event permit may ask for a review of the decision by filing a written notice of appeal, stating the reason the denial should be overturned, with the event administrator within five business days following receipt of the event administrator's decision notice denying the permit. The appeal shall be heard and decided by the mayor's designee who shall schedule a hearing on the request within five business days following receipt of the notice of appeal. Should the time scheduled for the hearing cause a delay of the proposed event, an alternate date will be made available upon request and, should the public area requested be available and uncommitted, it will be reserved for the event, pending the outcome of the appeal. The organizer shall be given at least 24 hours' advanced notice of the hearing. 
(b)  Conduct of hearing . The organizer, or someone designated by the organizer to act on the organizer's behalf, shall appear at the hearing in person, and may be represented by counsel. Failure of the organizer, or the organizer's designee, to appear at the hearing shall be deemed to be a withdrawal of the appeal. The event administrator shall attend the hearing. The event administrator and the organizer, or the organizer's designee, shall have the right to be heard on the matter and present evidence in support of their respective positions. The mayor's designee shall uphold the decision of the event administrator if a ground for denial exists and, where appropriate, offer an alternative to denial in accordance with section 23-237(c). The decision may be made at the conclusion of the hearing stating orally the reasons for the decision, or, by written notice by the close of the next business day following the close of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. Failure of the mayor's designee to render a decision by the close of the next business day following the close of the hearing shall operate as an automatic upholding the event administrator's decision. 
(c)  When review not available . In no event will a review lie under the provisions of this section for the denial of any permitting or licensing that is not issued under the authority of this article, including alcoholic beverage licensing, business licensing, technical and fire code permitting, and fireworks permitting. 
(Ord. No. 13-189, § 1, 5-9-2013)  
Sec. 23-239. - Permit amendment. 
(a)  A special event organizer who wishes to materially modify the conduct of the event as authorized by the special event permit shall file a permit amendment application with the event administrator on a form provided by the city within the applicable time prescribed in section 23-233(b). The permit amendment application shall describe the proposed change in the conduct of the event with the same detail required by section 23-233(d) for the initial permit application and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of this article. The event administrator shall take action on the special event permit amendment application in accordance with the terms of this article. The notice of decision and hearing provisions set forth in this article also shall apply to applications for permit amendments. 
(b)  A non-material change to the event conduct of permitted special event that complies with this article may be made at any time prior to the start of the event by notifying the event administrator of the proposed change.

Sec. 25-90. - Rotation roster. 
(a)  A wrecker shall be called from the rotation roster when the following circumstances occur: when the owner, driver, or person in charge of a vehicle to be towed has been advised by the officer on the scene that such vehicle must be removed and that he may call or request the wrecker company of his choice. However, only wrecker companies permitted to tow within the city shall be contacted by police. In the event the owner, driver, or person in charge of the vehicle indicates that he has no preference, or the permitted wrecker of his choice fails to respond to the call within a reasonable period of time considering the time of day, the weather conditions and the traffic conditions, the officer shall see that the next wrecker from the appropriate roster shall be called. In no event shall any officer suggest, direct, or otherwise imply that a particular wrecker be called. 
(b)  A wrecker operator shall promptly respond to a dispatch and arrive on-scene with a fully functional wrecker within 30 minutes under normal driving conditions. If a wrecker operator is not capable at the time of dispatch to so respond, he/she shall immediately notify the department's communication center of this fact. If the wrecker operator provides immediate notice of the delay and provides a reasonable time of arrival on-scene, the wrecker operator may take up to a total of 40 minutes from the time of dispatch to arrive. If this is not feasible, however, the wrecker operator shall make the same known to the department's communication center and the wrecker company will be passed over for that rotation and the dispatch will go to the next wrecker company on the rotation roster. When determining whether a violation of this provision has occurred, the police department shall consider the time of day, the weather conditions and traffic conditions. 
(c)  When a wrecker operator responds to a dispatch, but renders no wrecker services through no fault of his/her own, the wrecker company will not lose position on the rotation roster if the wrecker operator provides prompt notification of the same to the department's communications center. 
(d)  Two separate rosters are established as follows: 
(1)  Regular haul roster: This roster shall be in effect 24 hours a day, seven days a week for assignment by the police department to tow up to three-quarter ton vehicles for those persons who have no preference as to the company to use; and 
(2)  Large haul roster: This roster shall be in effect 24 hours a day, seven days a week for assignment by the police department to tow vehicles over three-quarters of a ton for those persons who have no preference as to the company to use. 
(e)  If the wrecker operator does not arrive on-scene within the time requirements established herein or if the public health, safety and welfare necessitate more expeditious action, the police department reserves the right to request the services of the next wrecker company on the rotation roster. Under these circumstances, the wrecker company who received the first call will forfeit his/her position on the rotation roster for that turn. Any wrecker operator who is late in responding to dispatches for wrecker service without justification may be subject to penalties as provided herein. 
(f)  The chief has the right to inspect any wrecker or equipment of a wrecker company on the city's rotation roster at any time to ascertain if it is being properly maintained and all required equipment is on the wrecker and in proper operating order. 
(g)  All wrecker companies on the rotation roster shall have wreckers and equipment inspected annually by the police department. A current inspection sticker will be issued by the department and must be properly displayed at all times. 
(h)  Any operator on said roster shall be an employee of the wrecker company, or listed on the company's payroll. 
(i)  Operators shall wear clothing consistent with his/her employing wrecker company, i.e. uniform, company logo, etc.

(13)  Righting or lifting vehicle by airbag, per pound lifted: $0.035.

Three removals of a wrecker company's name from the rotation roster, or conviction of the owner of the wrecker company of a felony, or any criminal conviction of the owner or any employee of the wrecker company for a criminal violation related to the wrecker business shall be sufficient grounds for the permanent revocation of any and all wrecker rotation roster permits issued to such company by the city.

(c)  The police department or any member of the police department or a member of the department of parking and public transit is authorized and directed to issue a citation to any respective automobile or any driver of that automobile, that is otherwise violating this section on request of the owner, operator of the premises where the violation is occurring.

Sec. 25-383. - Intent. 
The spilling of vehicle loads upon the public streets and other public ways of the city is a dangerous and blighting factor which damages, deteriorates and depreciates these public streets and other public ways, as well as adjacent and surrounding property. The city council finds that the spilling of vehicle loads is a public nuisance and recognizes that appropriate measures must be taken to keep public streets, other public ways and adjacent and surrounding property free from debris and other materials spilling from vehicles. Debris and other materials spilling from vehicles pose a danger of physical injury and property damage to motorists, pedestrians and other inhabitants of the city and cause the proliferation of trash, garbage, litter, and other dangerous or unsanitary debris within the city. The prevention of the spilling of vehicle loads and the removal of spillage from streets is necessary to prevent proliferation of this problem. This article is enacted to protect, promote and preserve the safety and welfare of the citizens of the city through the reduction, control and prevention of vehicle spillage within the city. The council does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing state law.

(a)  Scope and availability. This section establishes the general power rateschedule GSD and is applicable only to such schedule. This section shall apply to the firm electric power requirements where a customer's currently effective contract demand is greater than 25,000 kw. 
(b)  Character of service. Service is alternating current, single- or three-phase, 60 hertz. Power shall be delivered at a transmission voltage of 161 kv or, if such transmission voltage is not available, at the highest voltage available in the vicinity, unless at the customer's request a lower standard voltage is agreed upon. 
(c)  Base charges. 
(1)  Customer charge. $1,500.00 per delivery point per month. 
(2)  Demand charge. $12.60 per kw of billing demand per month, plus an additional $12.60 per kw per month for each kw, if any, of the amount by which the customer's billing demand exceeds its contract demand. 
(3)  Energy charge. $0.02265 per kwh per month. 
(d)  Adjustment. The base demand and energy charges shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the current adjustment addendum published by TVA. (In addition, such charges shall be increased or decreased to correspond to increases or decreases determined by TVA in the value of the hydro generation benefit allocated to residential customers.) 
(e)  Facilities rental charge. There shall be no facilities rental charge under this section for delivery at bulk transmission voltage levels of 161 kv or higher. For delivery at less than 161 kv, there shall be added to the customer's bill a facilities rental charge. This charge shall be $0.36 per kw per month except for delivery at voltages below 46 kv, in which case the charge shall be $0.93 per kw per month for the first 10,000 kw and $0.73 per kw per month for the excess over 10,000 kw. Such charge shall be applied to the highest billing demand established during the latest 12-consecutive-month period or the customer's currently effective contract demand and shall be in addition to all other charges under this section, including minimum bill charges. 
(f)  Reactive demand charges. If the reactive demand (in kvar) is lagging during the 30-consecutive-minute period beginning or ending on a clock hour of the month in which the customer's highest metered demand occurs, there shall be added to the customer's bill a reactive charge of $0.78 per kvar of the amount, if any, by which the reactive demand exceeds 33 percent of such metered demand. If the reactive demand (in kvar) is leading during the 30-consecutive-minute period beginning or ending on a clock hour of the month in which the customer's lowest metered demand (excluding any metered demands which are less than 25 percent of the highest metered demand) occurs, there shall be added to the customer's bill a reactive charge of $0.33 per kvar of the amount of reactive demand. Such charges shall be in addition to all other charges under this rate schedule, including minimum bill charges. 
(g)  Determination of demand. The distributor shall meter the demands in kw of all customers served under this rate schedule. The metered demand for any month shall be the highest average during any 30-consecutive-minute period beginning or ending on a clock hour of the month of the load metered in kw, and such amount shall be used as the billing demand, except that the billing demand for any month shall in no case be less than the sum of 30 percent of the first 5,000 kw, 40 percent of the next 20,000 kw, 50 percent of the next 25,000 kw, 60 percent of the next 50,000 kw, 70 percent of the next 100,000 kw, 80 percent of the next 150,000 kw, and 85 percent of all kw in excess of 350,000 kw of the higher of the currently effective contract demand or the highest billing demand established during the preceding 12 months. 
(h)  Minimum bill. The monthly bill under this section, excluding any facilities rental charges and any reactive charges, shall not be less than the sum of the base customer charge, the base demand charge, as adjusted (but excluding the additional portion thereof applicable to excess of billing demand over contract demand) applied to the customer's billing demand and the base energy charge, as adjusted, applied to the customer's energy takings. The distributor may require higher minimum bills. 
(i)  Contract requirement. The distributor shall require contracts for all service provided under this section. The contract shall be for an initial term of at least five years and any renewals or extensions of the initial contract shall be for a term of at least five years; after ten years of service, any such contract for the renewal or extension of service may provide for termination upon not less than 16 months' notice. The customer shall contract for the maximum requirements, which shall not exceed the amount of power capable of being used by the customer, and the distributor shall not be obligated to supply power in greater amount at any time than the customer's currently effective contract demand. If the customer uses any power other than that supplied by the distributor under this section, the contract may include other special provisions. The rate schedule in any power contract shall be subject to adjustment, modification, change, or replacement from time to time as provided under the power contract between the distributor and TVA. 
(j)  Payment. Bills under this section will be rendered monthly. Any amount of the bill unpaid after the due date specified on the bill may be subject to additional charges under the distributor's standard policy. 
(k)  Single-point delivery. The charges under this section are based upon the supply of service through a single delivery and metering point, and at a single voltage. If service is supplied to the same customer through more than one point of delivery or at different voltages, the supply of service at each delivery and metering point and at each different voltage shall be separately metered and billed. 
(l)  Rules and regulations. Service is subject to rules and regulations of the distributor.

Sec. 26-451. - Generally. 
Rates or charges for natural gas to consumers served by the gas distribution system of the city shall be as provided in this division. 
(Ord. No. 00-315, § 17-76, 4-13-2000)  
Sec. 26-452. - Allocations, prorations and penalties. 
(a)  Allocations, prorations. Whenever, for any reason, any or all of the suppliers of natural gas to the city curtails, decreases or impairs in any way whatsoever the supply of natural gas which the city secures for the consumers and customers of the city natural gas system or should the supply of natural gas not be available to serve all of the customers and consumers of the city natural gas system, then, in such event, the city shall have the right, for the purposes of allocating the supply to the consumers and customers of the city natural gas system to allocate and prorate the amount of natural gas which any or all of the consumers or customers receive for such periods of time as shall be required by the city. Notice of such allocations shall be given by announcements to media, newspapers and other means of communication. 
(b)  Penalty and curtailment . Should any customer, on any day or for any month, who has been placed on allocation or proration without the city's prior approval take or use a volume of natural gas in excess of the maximum daily or monthly quantity of natural gas which the city has allocated or prorated to any of its customers or consumers, then such volume in excess of such allocation or proration shall constitute unauthorized overrun volume, and for such overrun volume the customer or consumer who incurs such overrun shall pay unto the city any penalty assessed on the city by any pipeline or supplier for the overrun and a penalty of $1.00 for each mcf of natural gas constituting unauthorized overrun volume taken by the customer or consumer up to and including the volume of natural gas which is one percent in excess of the amount which has been allocated or prorated to the customer or consumer, and a penalty of $10.00 for each additional mcf of natural gas in excess of one percent over and above the amount allocated or prorated to the consumer or customer. The penalty shall be paid by the customer or consumer who incurred the unauthorized overrun together with and in addition to the demand and commodity charges payable by the customer or consumer for the month in which said overrun volume was taken. The payment of a penalty for unauthorized overrun shall not under any circumstances be considered giving such customer or consumer the right to take unauthorized overrun nor shall such payment be considered as a substitute for any other remedy available to the city against the offending customer or consumer for failure to respect its obligations to adhere to the provisions of this rate schedule. In addition to the penalties imposed or improvised in this subsection, whenever such unauthorized overrun has or might impair or jeopardize the supply of natural gas which the city has secured for its other customers and consumers, then the city shall have the right to discontinue the natural gas service to such customer or consumer who has incurred such unauthorized overrun. 
(c)  Applicability . The provisions of this section shall be applicable to all customers served by the city natural gas system, including but not being limited to those customers and consumers whose rates and charges are set forth in class 00, class 10, class 11, class 16, class 22, class 35, class 39, class 40 and class 41. 
(Ord. No. 00-315, §§ 17-7717-79, 4-13-2000; Ord. No. 01-970, § 17-92, 11-20-2001; Ord. No. 15-909 , 12-17-2015)  
Sec. 26-453. - Deposit and rate adjustment. 
(a)  Deposit . A cash deposit or suitable guarantee, as approved, by the city gas utility board, not exceeding twice the highest bill may be required of any customer or person before gas or transportation service is supplied. The city electric utility board, the city gas utility board and the city waterworks utility board may enter into an agreement to establish a combined utility deposit; to establish a minimum deposit for all types of service, and to distribute the proceeds from these deposits. Interest may be accumulated on these deposits from October 1, 1973, at a rate as may from time to time be determined by the board and will be added to the deposit at the time service is terminated. The deposit, plus accumulated interest, may be applied against any unpaid bills of the customer and if any balance remains after such application is made, such balance shall be refunded to the customer. 
(b)  Gas rate adjustment. Recognizing that rates charged for natural gas are governed and determined by the cost of natural gas and other gas which is purchased by the city, the rates which are set forth in the rate schedules for charges for natural gas as set forth in sections 26-45426-464 are to be increased and decreased daily on the basis of the cost of natural gas or other gas purchased by the city from its supplier. To the cost of gas purchased, the city shall add the cost of transportation, manufacturing gas, operational and distribution costs, and six percent of the total cost as charged to the customer. The adjusted rate shall be effective on the same date as such rate is made effective to the city by its supplier or suppliers of natural gas or such other gas as may or might be injected to the city natural gas system. 
(c)  Transportation rate adjustment. Recognizing that rates charged for transportation services are determined by the cost of agreements and contracts with pipeline suppliers, whereby capacity received by the city is to be paid for whether the contracted capacity is fully utilized and such fixed cost is to be factored into the cost of gas delivered to the customers of the city natural gas distribution system, and that the rates charged for natural gas are to be adjusted as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, all of which has been necessitated by the deregulation of natural gas which will cause the rates or charges for natural gas to fluctuate, it is therefore determined that adjustments to the industrial transportation rates and charges as set forth in sections 26-46526-469 will be necessary and that all adjustments, changes or amendments from time to time as determined necessary will be made by the city gas utility board to assure that cost of transportation service and other costs charged to customers that utilize industrial transportation rate schedule will compensate the city natural gas system for all costs and expenses that it has and will be incurring in having gas pipeline capacity service being made available to the city natural gas system through which industrial transportation service can be made available to industrial customers as set forth in this division.

Such trees shall not be removed by the city without notice of the adjoining owner, except when such notice would impede the city's protection of the safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or the safe operation and maintenance of the street or highway, or of public utilities or drainage facilities located within said rights-of-way. Removal for any other purpose shall be preceded by reasonable notice to the owner of the adjacent property, and based upon a finding by the city forester that such removal is in accordance with adopted standards. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 2, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-33. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Adopted tree care standards are those standards of tree maintenance, trimming clearances, and methods of protection of trees during construction, as established in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard A300 (2001), National Standard for Tree Care Operations - Tree, Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance - Part 1 - Standard Pruning Practices, as may be amended; and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z133.1 (2000), Arboricultural Operations - Pruning, Trimming, Repairing, Maintaining, and Removing Trees, and Cutting Brush - Safety Requirements, as may be amended. 
Caliper means tree trunk diameter, measured six inches above ground for trees with up to a four-inch caliper, and 12 inches above ground for larger trees. 
City means the City of Huntsville and its authorized agents and contractors. 
Critical rooting distance means the radius around the base of a tree including both the root plate and the transport roots attached to them, in which soil disturbance is likely to affect the overall health of the tree, and root damage is likely to introduce disease-causing organisms into the tree. This radius, in feet, is approximately 2.5 times the tree's d.b.h. in inches. (See also, "root plate" and "d.b.h.") 
d.b.h. means "diameter breast height." For a single trunk tree, the d.b.h. is derived by measuring the trunk circumference of a tree at a point that is 4½ feet above ground on the uphill side of the tree and then dividing the circumference by 3.14. For a multi-stemmed tree, the d.b.h. is derived by obtaining the sum of the separate circumferences measured at a point 4½ feet above ground, then dividing the sum of the circumferences by 3.14. 
Easement-laden land means privately owned land on which an easement has been granted to the city or another entity to allow for public services such as utility distribution, water distribution and drainage, access to maintain the public services, etc. An easement is only a right of use. The grant of an easement does not transfer ownership rights. 
Electric power facilities refer to power transmission and distribution lines, transformers, substations, and associated equipment. 
Hedgerow means a row of closely-spaced shrubs or bushes used to delineate space, restrict access, provide screening, or achieve a similar function. 
Lateral separation means distance, measured horizontally at ground level, such as between an electrical conductor and the center of the trunk of a tree. 
Live crown ratio means the fraction or percentage of the overall height of a tree bearing living, healthy branches. 
Mulch means any organic material or rock placed over the soil surface of a planting area which serves the same function as leaf-litter in a natural forest environment. 
Owner means the possessor of title, his agent or assignee, to the land on which particular trees stand. In the case of a tree on easement-laden land, ownership rights and responsibilities are defined in section 27-51, in the absence of other specific provisions by deed or other binding agreement. 
Person means any individual acting on his own behalf, or on behalf of a company, agency, corporation, or other body. 
Planting means establishing a tree, shrub, groundcover, vine, or other species of vegetation in a location where it is to remain for an extended period, usually the useful lifespan of the plant in the absence of unforeseen circumstances. 
Private land means land belonging to a person or corporate entity, and not the city or other agency of government. 
Public land means any land belonging to the city, including platted rights-of-way or streets and alleys. For the purposes of this definition, federal, state and county land is excluded from this category unless the city has specifically assumed responsibility for its maintenance. 
Root plate means the area around the base of a tree in which the roots taper rapidly from pedestal roots to small transport roots; these structural roots are constantly subjected to compression and tension during windy conditions, so damage to these roots and subsequent decay commonly leads to catastrophic failure, especially during windy weather. (See also "critical rooting distance.") 
Shrub , see the definition of trees and shrubs below. 
Tree commission means any member of the Huntsville Tree Commission as described in division 8 of article VIII of chapter 2 of this Code, or any individual, including the city forester, assigned or contracted by the tree commission, acting in pursuit of the objectives of this article within its scope and within the bounds of law. 
Trees and shrubs mean all woody vegetation, whether naturally occurring or planted; rights, responsibilities, and standards applying to trees shall, from a legal standpoint, apply to shrubs as well. 
Utility, private means a commercial service distributed by use of the public streets, alleys, and easements of the city by the use of facilities and fixtures located therein, but not regulated by the State of Alabama Public Service Commission. 
Utility, public means a service distributed by wire, pipe, or airwaves to customers, and either regulated by the State of Alabama Public Service Commission (as in the case of telephone service) or not regulated by the Public Service Commission, but established as a municipal utility (as in the case of water, electric and gas service). 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 3, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-34. - Offenses. 
In relation to any tree or shrub located on public or easement-laden land, it shall be unlawful for any person not authorized to do so: 
(1)  To break, injure, mutilate, burn, kill, remove, or destroy any tree or shrub without authority to do so as set forth in this article; 
(2)  To knowingly permit any leak to exist in any gas pipe or main, within the root zone of such tree or shrub; 
(3)  To permit any toxic chemical, either solid or liquid, to pass, drain, or be emptied on or about any such tree or shrub; 
(4)  To knowingly permit any wire designed to carry electrical current to be attached to any tree or shrub, except in accordance with adopted standards; 
(5)  To excavate any tunnel, ditch, or trench, or to lay any driveway, sidewalk, or pavement through or across the root zone of any such tree or shrub, except in accordance with adopted standards; 
(6)  To attach any wire, rope, cable, poster, sign, nail, or other fastener to such tree or shrub, except in accordance with adopted standards; 
(7)  To place, deposit, or store any stone, brick, sand, earth, or other material so as to impede the passage of water, air, and fertilizer to the roots of any such tree or shrub, except in accordance with adopted standards; 
(8)  To move any building or other large object along any street in such a manner as to damage any tree or shrub that is maintained in accordance with adopted standards; 
(9)  To undertake to build any structure, pavement, utility, or other construction without proper consideration of such trees and shrubs in accordance with adopted standards; 
(10)  To unreasonably prevent, delay, or interfere with the city tree commission or any of its agents engaging in or about the planting, maintenance, or removal of any tree or shrub on public, easement-laden, or private lands as authorized in this article. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 4, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-35. - Enforcement. 
When it comes to the attention of a city department or Huntsville Utilities that trees or other vegetation is in violation of these standards, that agency will request the city forester to inspect the problem jointly with a representative of that department. If a violation is believed to exist, the city forester will refer the matter to the property owner for redress, at his or her expense, within 14 calendar days. If the owner has not corrected the problem within that time, the city forester will refer all information to the appropriate enforcement authority. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 5, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-36. - Penalties and appeals. 
(a)  Penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined a sum sufficient to restore any damage resulting from the violation not to exceed $500.00 per tree or shrub damaged, and may be required to make such restitution in goods and/or labor as may be determined by the proper court of law, or may be sentenced to any combination of these penalties. 
(b)  Appeals. Appeals of arbitration, decisions or other actions by the tree commission may be made first to the city council and further to the proper court of law. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 6, 2-12-2004)  
Secs. 27-3727-50. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 2. - TREE MAINTENANCE AND PROTECTION 
 
Sec. 27-51. - Trees on public land or easement-laden land. 
(a)  Maintenance. Maintenance of trees located on public or easement-laden lands shall be performed under the supervision of the city forester who shall be in consultation with the city department having jurisdiction over the property in question. 
(b)  Abatement of hazards. When it comes to the attention of an officer or agent of the city that any tree maintained on a parcel of property which adjoins any public land or easement-laden land which is, or is likely to become, a threat to the public safety, the appropriate agent of the city, including the city forester, shall take one or more of the following actions: 
(1)  a.  If the tree in question is deemed to be on private property, the officer or agent of the city shall, if possible, give notice to the property owner upon whose land the hazardous condition exists and allow the property owner a fixed period of time to take the necessary action or actions needed to remedy the hazardous condition; or 
b.  The officer or agent of the city may forthwith abate the hazardous condition by taking the appropriate and necessary action or actions in accordance with adopted standards. 
c.  If the tree in question is deemed to be wholly located on private property, and the owner of the private property has failed to abate the hazardous condition, the cost of the city's abating the hazard shall be assessed against the property owner. 
(2)  If the tree in question is deemed to be partially located on private property and partially located on public property, then the cost of abating the hazard shall be borne both by the city and the private property owner. The assessment of costs that shall be attributed to the city and to the property owner shall be assessed and prorated based on the proportion of the stump diameter of the tree located on private and public property. 
When it comes to the attention of any owner of a parcel of land which adjoins any public land or easement-laden land that any tree maintained by him is, or is likely to become, a threat to the public safety, it is the duty of said owner to abate said hazard by appropriate action in accordance with the adopted standards. 
(c)  Planting of trees on public land. Any tree hereafter planted on, or in such location that as it matures it will affect the safe use of public land shall be selected, sited, planted, and maintained in accordance with the tree care standards set out in this article. Further, any tree classified by the city forester and the tree commission as unacceptable for planting on city property may be removed through the processes described in this article. A copy of the acceptable and unacceptable species of trees for planting shall be provided upon request by the city forester. 
(d)  Removal and replacement of trees on public land. 
(1)  Tree removal permits. Any public department or public utility removing a tree or shrub from public land shall do so in accordance with the standards adopted in this article. Any person or agency, private or public, needing to remove a tree six inches or more in d.b.h. from public land shall first obtain by telephone a removal permit from the city forester. Such permits may be granted for one tree or for groups of trees, and shall be issued at no cost under guidelines established by the tree commission. 
(2)  Replacement of trees removed by permit. Any person or agency removing trees, by permit, which are six inches or more in d.b.h. shall provide for the planting of new trees in approximately equal numbers and in appropriate locations mutually agreed upon by the city forester and the person obtaining the permit. Failure to obtain a permit when one would be required for removal of a tree shall not relieve responsibility for its replacement. 
The city forester shall coordinate planting of trees as needed to replace those removed during construction by any city agency. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 7, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-52. - Trees on private land. 
(a)  Trees located on private land are the property and responsibility of the owner of such land. Yet such trees also have public usefulness, and value in energy conservation; in moderating extremes of temperature and humidity; in reducing noise, glare, and air pollution; in reducing soil erosion; and in improving the city's aesthetic character. To encourage conservation of this resource, the tree commission is empowered to take the following measures: 
(1)  Provide information and technical referral service to landowners, developers, builders, and other interested parties, including persons and private and public agencies, in protecting trees during planting and construction; 
(2)  Cooperate with interested public and private parties in conservation efforts such as Arbor Week observance, plant digs, community tree-planting, etc.; 
(3)  Participate in cooperative community projects as authorized and directed elsewhere in this article. 
(b)  Trees on, or affecting, the use of easement-laden lands. Trees on easement-laden lands are the property and responsibility of the owner of the land on which the easement lies. The city accepts no responsibility for the management of such trees beyond what is necessary to accomplish its lawful activities on such land, or consequent to such activities within applicable statutes of limitations. All removal or maintenance work involving such trees shall be conducted in accordance with the tree care standards adopted herein. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 8, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-53. - Tree care standards. 
(a)  Tree planting. 
(1)  Planting procedures. The planting specifications approved by the city forester and the tree commission shall be used for all planting projects executed or coordinated by the city. These procedures are to be adapted for individual planting sites by the city forester. The procedures include proper watering, mulching, staking, guying, etc. Additional information, including a copy of the planting specifications, shall be available from the city forester upon request. 
(2)  Minimum size of trees to be planted on city property. 
Mature tree size 
(A copy of the classification chart is available through the city forester.) 	Minimum size at planting 
Large & medium 	1½" caliper 
(2"2.5" preferred) 
Small 	5'6' height 
(6'8' preferred) 
 
(3)  Planting distance from above ground electrical utility lines, as measured horizontally from a line on the ground directly under the nearest charged conductor, generally. 
Mature tree size 
(A copy of the classification chart is available through the city forester.) 	Minimum lateral separation 
Large 	20' 
Medium 	15' 
Small 	no lateral separation required 
In instances where the minimum lateral separation requirement would prevent the planting of a tree, the city department having jurisdiction over the property in question shall work with Huntsville Utilities in order to reach a solution which will allow for the planting of a tree. Should the parties involved be unable to reach an agreement, the matter will be settled by a majority vote of the tree commission only after each of the involved parties have had an opportunity to present argument. 
 
(4)  Planting distance from sewer lines, sanitary & storm, generally. 
Tree species 	Minimum lateral separation 
Most trees, other than exceptions listed below 	5' 
Hackberry, pines, and all hedgerows 	10' 
Species deemed unacceptable by the city forester and the tree commission. Further information is available upon request from the city forester. 	May not be planted 
In instances where the minimum lateral separation requirement would prevent the planting of a tree, the city department having jurisdiction over the property in question shall work with water pollution control and/or public works in order to reach a solution which will allow for the planting of a tree. Should the parties involved be unable to reach an agreement, the matter will be settled by a majority vote of the tree commission only after each of the involved parties have had an opportunity to present argument. 
 
(5)  Parking lot landscaping plantings. All parking lot landscaping must conform to appendix A, zoning, of this Code, as amended or supplemented. 
(b)  Greenspace planting agreement. The city wishes to encourage and promote the planting of shade trees along streets within the city; however right-of-way space is limited and not always adequate for large-growing shade trees. Space on private property adjoining the right-of-way is often adequate for the planting of shade trees by the city, and the use of such space would insure that many streets and neighborhoods that would otherwise be excluded from the city tree planting program would be included. The planting of shade trees by the city on private property adjoining the right-of-way would produce significant public benefits by providing a healthy and attractive tree canopy along city streets, and also serve to encourage property owners to plant suitable shade trees in a similar manner on their property. 
For these reasons, the city forester is hereby authorized to contract with property owners within the city using the following contract: 
"GREENSPACE PLANTING AGREEMENT 
"This Greenspace planting agreement is made by the undersigned property owner(s) and the Huntsville City Forestry Division, under the authority of Section 2-1455 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Huntsville.

Sec. 27-54. - Pruning standards. 
The pruning of trees on city property, or pruning conducted by city employees shall be in accordance with: 
(1)  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard A300 (2001), as may be amended; and 
(2)  The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z133 (2000), as may be amended. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 10, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-55. - Required electric power line clearances. 
(a)  When pruning is required to maintain the necessary clearance between any existing tree and an electric power line, the pruning shall be conducted in accordance with ANSI Standard A300. Branches or leaders to be cut back shall either be pruned to the next lateral having a diameter at least one-third of that being cut, or else be pruned just outside the branch-collar at the base of the branch. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection (c) below, the following maximum clearances shall be periodically established between electrical conductors at various voltages and adjoining vegetation: 
(1)  Telephone, TV cable, and other insulated communication lines require no minimum clearance; 
(2)  Secondary electric lines which carry voltage between 21750 volts, insulated, shall require a clearance of two feet for areas of existing construction, and a clearance of four feet for areas of new construction; 
(3)  Distribution and transmission lines which carry voltage between 75035,000 volts, uninsulated, shall require a clearance of ten feet; 
(4)  Distribution and transmission lines which carry voltage in excess of 35,000 volts, uninsulated, shall require a clearance of 15 feet. 
(c)  To lengthen the time between clearance pruning cycles for electric transmission and distribution lines, and to facilitate proper pruning to laterals as described in ANSI Standard A300, as referenced in subsection (a), above, clearances around transmission and distribution lines as set out in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), above, may be increased to 15 feet and 20 feet, respectively, at the discretion of Huntsville Utilities, for the following species only: 
Hackberry and Sugarberry ( Celtis occidentalis and Celtis laevigata 
Boxelder ( Acer negundo ) 
Silver maple ( Acer saccharinum ) 
Tree of heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ) 
Cottonwood ( Populus deltoides ) 
Princesstree ( Paulownia tomentosa ) 
Siberian elm ( Ulmus pumila ) 
Black cherry ( Prunus serotina ) 
Loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) 
(d)  Removal and replacement of street trees near electric power facilities. When in the judgment of Huntsville Utilities, a tree interferes with the safe and reliable operation of the electric power system along a street right-of-way, and cannot be pruned in accordance with ANSI Standard A300 so as to provide the required clearance as listed in subsection (b) and (c), above, Huntsville Utilities may offer to remove the tree and request replacement planting by the city, with a species and in a location mutually acceptable to the city, to Huntsville Utilities, and to the property owner. Such trees may be planted on public land, or private property, within the limitations and intent of section 27-53(b). 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 11, 2-12-2004; Ord. No. 05-576, 7-14-2005)  
Sec. 27-56. - Required right-of-way clearances. 
The pruning clearances applicable to sidewalks, streets, allies, or any other rights-of-way, traffic control signals or signs, and all street lighting shall be in accordance with the standards adopted in section 25-462 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 12, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-57. - Protection of trees on public land during construction. 
(a)  Plans for any construction done by or for the city, on either public land or easement-laden land, shall include a tree management plan, developed by or in cooperation with the city forester, for existing trees on the construction site. This plan shall: 
(1)  Identify and provide protection instructions for trees whose species, condition and location justify their preservation on the construction site. Protection instructions shall include, at a minimum, measures to: 
a.  Prevent mechanical damage to the trunks and branches of trees to be preserved; 
b.  Prevent construction activities of all types in trees' root-plate area; 
c.  Evaluate planned construction (grade cuts and fills; paving; materials storage; traffic and parking; fires; attachment of signs, fences, utility boxes; improper handling and dumping of toxic materials; washing and maintenance of equipment; etc.) in the critical rooting distance of trees to be saved, and provide measures to minimize damage to the trees in such areas; 
d.  Provide landscaping recommendations for interfaces between construction areas and tree-save zones; 
e.  Provide elements of an education program for work crew members and their supervisors. 
(2)  Provide for the removal of trees that cannot or should not be preserved during construction. 
(b)  The project manager shall consult the city forester for individual tree problems when necessary. 
(c)  For the disposal or removal of tree-maintenance residues, see article III, storage and collection, of chapter 22, solid waste, of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 04-45, § 13, 2-12-2004)  
Sec. 27-58. - Education of tree care workers. 
(a)  The city forester will acquire or develop training materials oriented toward field tree-service crews and their supervisors, on the following topics and others as needed: 
(1)  Company and public policies, ordinances, etc.; 
(2)  Tree anatomy and growth; 
(3)  Tree reactions to injury and decay; 
(4)  Tree maintenance standards (ANSI Standard A-300); 
(5)  Safety and aerial rescue (ANSI Standard Z-133); and 
(6)  Utility pruning techniques. 
(b)  The city forester shall provide appropriate assistance, as requested by city departments, utility companies, commercial tree-service companies, etc., in the training of crews, supervisors, and other personnel, and may contract with instructors available from outside sources, if needed, with costs shared by agencies requesting the training.

ARTICLE III. - WEEDS AND OVERGROWN GRASS 
 
Sec. 27-91. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Grass and weed nuisance means any abundance of overgrown grass or weeds within the city, which is injurious to the general health, safety and welfare by providing breeding grounds and shelter for rats, mice, snakes, mosquitoes and other vermin, insects and pests; or attaining such heights and dryness so as to constitute a fire threat or hazard; bearing wingy or downy seeds, when mature, that cause the spread of weeds and, when breathed, irritation to the throat, lungs and eyes of the public; or hiding debris, such as broken glass or metal, which could inflict injury on any person going upon the property; or being unsightly, or any growth of grass or weeds, other than ornamental growth, which exceeds a height of eight inches growing upon any lot or parcel of land within any platted, subdivided, or improved residential, commercial or industrial subdivision, and any growth of grass or weeds, other than ornamental growth, which exceeds a height of 12 inches on property adjacent to a platted, subdivided, or improved residential, commercial or industrial subdivision. 
Improved subdivision means a division of a tract of land or acreage into tracts or parcels, and the improvement by construction of streets, water lines and, where applicable, sewer lines to serve the subdivided property. 
Natural condition means uncultivated and unseated land, still in a state of nature; but any growth on land once it has been cleared or plowed is not a natural condition, even though it has not been planted or cultivated by anyone. 
Owner of property means legal titleholder, or lessee, or occupant of property, or agent of legal titleholder or lessee, in charge, possession or control of the property. 
(Ord. No. 86-294, 5-8-1986; Ord. No. 04-948, 12-9-2004; Ord. No. 15-922 , § 1, 12-17-2015) 
Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 27-92. - Exceptions. 
Excepted from the requirements of this article are: 
(1)  Any property which is in its natural condition. Any growth on land once it has been cleared or plowed is not a natural condition, even though it has not been planted or cultivated by anyone. 
(2)  Any property which is located outside any improved subdivision and is located more than 200 feet from any boundary of any lot or parcel of real estate upon which any dwelling is located, and more than 200 feet from any commercial enterprise. 
(3)  Cultivated row crops and garden plants in their respective growing seasons. But this exception applies only to growing crops and garden plants and shall not be construed to permit any crops or gardens to become overgrown with grass and weeds in violation of the remaining terms of this article. 
(4)  Ornamental shrubbery and ground cover, provided that such uses are part of a landscaping theme and not associated with a general deterioration of the property. 
(Ord. No. 86-294, 5-8-1986)  
Sec. 27-93. - Overgrown condition prohibited. 
It shall be unlawful and a nuisance, in violation of this article, for the owner of any real property situated within the corporate limits of the city to allow such real property to become overgrown with tall grass, or with any weed or plant such as jimson, burdock, ragweed, cocklebur or other weed of like kind, or any weed or plant bearing wingy or downy seeds, or any weed or plant that is otherwise noxious, dangerous, harmful or poisonous. 
(Ord. No. 86-294, 5-8-1986)  
Sec. 27-94. - Maintenance of grass, weeds. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the owner of any real property located within the city to maintain any grass or weeds growing upon the property in such a manner as not to constitute a nuisance. 
(b)  The duties and obligations of the owner of any real property located within the city extend to and include any such real property situated within a dedicated right-of-way or easement burdening the property, except to the extent that it may be impracticable to do so because of public facilities located there. Such rights-of-way and easements must be maintained by the owner in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the owner's remaining property and within the requirements set forth in this article, except to the extent it may be impracticable to do because of public facilities located there. 
(Ord. No. 86-294, 5-8-1986)  
Sec. 27-95. - Maintenance practices of City of Huntsville and of public utilities. 
The dedication and existence of a right-of-way for a public road and of an easement for drainage or for public utilities represents the grant of only a limited interest in property and does not change the actual ownership of the property upon which the right-of-way or easement is located. The public authority maintains rights-of-way and easements only to the extent necessary to maintain the public facility and to maintain safety. The owner of the burdened property continues to control the property, except to the extent that such control interferes with the public use.

Sec. 27-96. - Enforcement. 
If the owner of real property located within the corporate limits of the city shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this article, the manager of the community development division or other code enforcement officer of the community development division may cause to be served upon such owner, in person or by first class mail, notice requiring such owner to comply with this article within a time stated in the notice, or to appear for an administrative hearing before the manager or other code enforcement officer or officers of the community development division as designated by the manager to determine whether the owner is in violation of this article. The notice shall apprise the owner of the facts of the claims against him and shall name a particular date, time and place for such hearing. The manager and the owner shall have the right to compel attendance of witnesses on his own behalf at such hearing. If after the hearing the manager finds that this article has been violated and a nuisance exists, the owner shall have five days from the hearing date, or five days from the date of notice by personal service or by first class mail, of the manager's determination, whichever is the later date, to comply with this article; otherwise, the manager may thereafter institute the following enforcement procedures: 
(1)  a.  The manager of the community development division may cause the cutting of the offending grass or weeds. The manager shall keep an account of the costs of the cutting of the grass or weeds and shall render an itemized report in writing to the city council, setting forth the costs of cutting the grass or weeds. The owner shall be notified by first class mail at least five days in advance of the time fixed by the manager for the council to receive the report; and the owner may appear at that time and present objections, if any there be, to the report. 
b.  At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the council shall hear the report, together with any objections which may be raised by any of the owners whose property is liable to be assessed for the work and thereupon make such modifications in the report as they deem necessary, after which by motion or resolution the report shall be confirmed. The amounts of the cost for cutting and removing the grass or weeds mentioned in the report shall constitute special assessments against the land and as thus made and confirmed shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such assessments. After confirmation of the report, a copy shall be turned over to the city clerk-treasurer, who is charged with the collection of assessments, whereupon it shall be the duty of the city clerk-treasurer to charge the assessments against the respective lots and parcels of land for municipal purposes; and thereafter such amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal assessments are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal assessments. 
(2)  The manager of the community development division or any enforcement officer working under his supervision may issue a citation to the owner of the property, requiring the owner to appear in the municipal court to answer charges for the violation of this article. Such citation shall name the party charged, the address of the property where the alleged violation is located, and the nature of the offense or violation. It shall also apprise the owner of the date, time and place at which to appear for court. Upon a finding of guilty in the municipal court, the owner is subject to the same penalty as provided for violation of city ordinances in section 1-7. Such citation, returnable to the municipal court shall be served on the owner of the property by any enforcement officer for the community development division, who shall forthwith appear and make oath as to the alleged offense before a magistrate of the municipal court. This provision for the issuance of a citation to municipal court shall not prevent any such officer from appearing before a municipal court magistrate and making oath as to the facts and applying for a summons or warrant with respect to any alleged offense, in lieu of issuing a citation. 
(3)  The manager of the community development division may institute both enforcement procedures set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The institution of one procedure does not preclude the subsequent or simultaneous institution of the other procedure, provided the criminal procedure is not used to collect any outstanding civil assessments against the subject property.

23.6.6. Site development. The Historic District Buffer Zones are intended to create harmonious transition zones between the urban core and the residential areas. These Historic District Buffer Zones will preserve and enhance the many historic buildings while adding new buildings that will expand and contribute to the low scale, small town, urban environment that makes the downtown attractive for pedestrians. Every effort should be made to preserve and renovate the historic structures and to create new infill construction that is compatible with the old in terms of scale, proportion, materials, design and function without being imitative. 
(1)  Street level walls. The purpose of the street level wall requirement is twofold. The first goal is to promote the establishment of a variety of retail, service and entertainment type businesses for the convenience of the office, residential, and tourist populations in the downtown area. The second aim is to promote pedestrian use and activity and to encourage a higher degree of street life and vitality in the downtown. Retailing is enhanced by having transparent store fronts abutting the sidewalk and by assembling a critical mass of continuous retail activities along adjoining streets. 
(a)  The front façade of all new buildings shall be oriented toward a public street as shall the principal entrances. 
(b)  Doorways shall be recessed into the building interior to a depth sufficient to separate sidewalk traffic from outwardly opening doors, to create focal interest, and to punctuate the street wall. 
(c)  To maintain consistency with the existing historic streetscapes, new construction shall utilize natural materials for the exterior cladding of all visible wall surfaces. The facades should be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings in terms of scale, color and texture of materials, form and massing, and design detailing. Acceptable materials include, but are not limited to, brick, stone, concrete stucco, terra cotta, precast concrete, glass, and where appropriate, cast metal for fenestrations, columns and beams. Polished stone and mirrored glass should be avoided as primary materials. Synthetic and imitation materials as well as aluminum, vinyl and plastic materials are not acceptable. 
(d)  To create an animated streetscape, an unbroken expanse of solid or blank wall shall not exceed 20 linear feet. Devices suitable to break such a wall span include doors, windows, display windows and cases, street art, fountains, plazas, trees and landscaping, pedestrian furniture and the introduction of variety in materials, texture, color and/or pattern of wall materials. 
(e)  Street level commercial spaces should be configured as units 15 to 50 feet wide in order to stimulate visual interest, establish a predictable rhythm for pedestrians, and encourage the introduction of small retail and service businesses. 
(f)  Windows located in street level walls, with the exception of stained glass windows, shall be transparent. Windows located in street level walls shall have a maximum sill height of 48 inches as measured from the sidewalk. 
(2)  Utilities and mechanical units. 
(a)  All power, communication and other wiring shall be located underground. 
(b)  All exterior mechanical equipment, trash facilities, and loading areas shall be adequately screened as well as practicable so as not to be visible from any street or by pedestrians. 
23.6.7. Landscaping requirements. 
(1)  Landscape buffers for surface parking. Buffer strips required to separate surface parking spaces from streets and pedestrian uses shall be landscaped in one of the following ways: 
(a)  A minimum five-foot wide planting bed having a continuous masonry wall between 30 and 42 inches high planted on the street side with at least one nondeciduous vine or shrub for every ten feet of wall length and one small maturing tree for every 30 feet of wall length. Trees, shrubs and vines shall be evenly distributed along the length of the wall. The landscape bed shall be planted with an evergreen ground cover; or 
(b)  A minimum five-foot wide bed having a hedge of a nondeciduous species, planted and maintained to form a continuous visual screen at least 30 inches high within one year of planting and one small maturing tree for every 30 linear feet of required planting bed. The bed shall be planted with an evergreen ground cover. 
(2)  General landscape requirements. 
(a)  Plant material used to fulfill these requirements must be provided with an adequate irrigation system which does not rely on drainage from the street, sidewalk, or buildings. 
(b)  All plant material must conform to the current version of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. 
(c)  The species of trees used must be consistent with adopted city ordinances concerning urban trees. 
(d)  Maintenance of landscaping in a healthy, neat and attractive condition is the responsibility of the owner of the property. Specifically, all plant material shall be watered, fertilized, pruned, kept free from weeds and litter, and replaced if diseased, injured or dead in a manner consistent with good horticultural practices. 
(e)  All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with section 73.19, installation of landscaping. 
23.6.8. Signs permitted. Signs shall be permitted in accordance with section 72.4.3 and shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of article 72, sign control regulations. 
(Ord. No. 09-510, § 2, 7-23-2009)

ARTICLE 24. - HIGHWAY BUSINESS C-4 DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The purpose of the highway business C-4 district is to provide for the retailing of goods and the furnishing of major services, selected trade shops, and automotive repairs. Characteristically, this district occupies a larger area than the neighborhood business C-1 district, is intended to serve a considerably greater population, and offers a wider range of specialized services. This district is intended to be utilized primarily by those commercial uses which cater to the traveling public, tourists, trucks, and heavy automobile traffic. 
To this extent, this district is usually located on a major arterial highway at or near the intersection with one or more other major arterial highways so that it is accessible from all directions. 
It is not the intent of this district to encourage the extension of existing strip commercial areas, since the pattern of present development provides more than ample frontage for this purpose. Future expansion of this district should desirably occur as an increase in district depth rather than as further striplike extension along thoroughfares. 
Within a highway business C-4 district as shown on the official Zoning Maps of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, the following regulations shall apply: 
 
24.1. - Uses permitted. 
24.1.1.  Land and buildings shall be used only for the following uses: 
Accessory structures and uses as permitted herein. 
Agricultural uses. 
Apparel stores. 
Ambulance services. 
Animal hospital or veterinary clinic, pet shops. 
Assisted living facilities. 
Auction gallery, including auto auction.

ARTICLE 26. - CENTRAL BUSINESS C-B DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The Central Business C-B District is intended to serve as a community focal point by recognizing and encouraging those unique characteristics that make Huntsville and its downtown distinctive. For 150 years Huntsville has functioned as a small, rural town although growth during the late 20th century has partially obscured those origins. The downtown and adjoining residential historic preservation districts are the only surviving concentrations of the historic town; two of the districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and more than 35 structures and sites in the commercial core are individually listed on the Register. 
The purpose of these regulations is to continue the development of the downtown in such a way as to provide a strong sense of continuity with the past by continuing those characteristics that created its identity: a dense concentration of low-scale buildings, a pedestrian rather than car orientation, high-quality materials and design, a diversity of uses including street level retail and services uses, and generous landscaping to soften the streetscape and buffer where needed. 
The streets in the downtown area are the networks of public open space that set the tone for the district. Because visual continuity is an important aspect in creating an identity for the downtown, a consistency in streetscape design should extend to redevelopment of the streets, the sidewalk pavement, the landscaping, and street furniture. To further enhance this continuity, a moderate building is specified, the intrusion of surface parking is discouraged, street level retail and commercial service uses are encouraged and identifiable building entrances are required. 
The ten-story height limit assures that new construction will be compatible with historic structures; minimizes the wind tunnel effect between buildings; assures the penetration of sunlight to ground level; enhances the pedestrian streetscape; and is conducive to small scale retail and service establishments. 
While parking cannot be eliminated, it can be treated so as to diminish its disruptive effects on the streetscape and its unsightly visual qualities. Surface parking is held to a minimum in this district and landscaping is required wherever parking abuts pedestrian use areas. The goal is to eventually replace surface lots with occupied buildings and to have parking provided in multi-level garages or within the buildings themselves. 
Within a Central Business C-B District as shown on the official Zoning Maps of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, the following regulations shall apply: 
 
26.1. - Uses permitted.

26.4. - Site development. 
The Central Business C-B District is intended to create a stable urban core that will preserve and enhance the many historic buildings while adding new buildings that will expand and contribute to the low scale, small town, urban environment that makes the downtown attractive for pedestrians. Every effort should be made to preserve and renovate the historic structures and to create new infill construction that is compatible with the old in terms of scale, proportion, materials, design and function without being imitative. The Central Business C-B District is perceived as being a very specialized sector of the city, one that combines private and governmental businesses with entertainment and tourism while encouraging high density residential development as an integral part of the mix. The regulations that follow focus on those aspects of development that are essential to the creation of a center that attracts people, who in turn provide the vitality that makes the downtown successful. 
26.4.1. Street level walls. The purpose of the street level wall requirement is twofold. The first goal is to promote the establishment of a variety of retail, service and entertainment type businesses for the convenience of the office, residential, and tourist populations in the downtown area. The second aim is to promote pedestrian use and activity and to encourage a higher degree of street life and vitality in the downtown. Retailing is enhanced by having transparent store fronts abutting the sidewalk and by assembling a critical mass of continuous retail activities along adjoining streets. 
(1)  The front facade of all new buildings shall be oriented toward a public street as shall the principle entrances. 
(2)  Doorways shall be recessed into the building interior to a depth sufficient to separate sidewalk traffic from outwardly opening doors, to create focal interest, and to punctuate the street wall. 
(3)  To maintain consistency with the existing historic streetscapes, new construction shall utilize natural materials for the exterior cladding of all visible wall surfaces. Acceptable materials include, but are not limited to, brick, stone, concrete stucco, terra cotta, recast concrete and glass. Synthetic and imitation materials as well as metal, aluminum, vinyl and plastic materials are not acceptable. 
(4)  To create an animated streetscape, at least 50 percent of the street level walls shall be windows and doorways. An unbroken expanse of solid or blank wall shall not exceed 20 linear feet. Devices suitable to break such a wall span include street art, fountains, plazas, trees and landscaping, pedestrian furniture and the introduction of variety in materials, texture, color and/or pattern of wall materials. 
(5)  Street level commercial spaces should be configured as units 15 to 40 feet wide in order to stimulate visual interest, establish a predictable rhythm for pedestrians, and encourage the introduction of small retail and service businesses. 
(6)  Windows located in street level walls, with the exception of stained glass windows, shall be transparent. 
26.4.2. Utilities and mechanical units. 
(1)  All power, communication and other wiring shall be located underground. 
(2)  All exterior mechanical equipment, trash facilities, and loading areas shall be adequately screened as well as practicable so as not to be visible from any street or by pedestrians. 
(Ord. No. 06-1201, § 1, 1-25-2007)  
26.5. - Landscaping requirements. 
26.5.1. landscape buffers for surface parking. Buffer strips required to separate surface parking spaces from streets and pedestrian uses shall be landscaped in one of the following ways: 
(1)  A five-foot wide planting bed having a continuous masonry wall between 30 and 42 inches high planted on the street side with at least one nondeciduous vine or shrub for every ten feet of wall length and one small maturing tree for every 30 feet of wall length. Trees, shrubs and vines shall be evenly distributed along the length of the wall. 
(2)  A five-foot bed having a hedge of a nondeciduous species, planted and maintained to form a continuous visual screen at least 30 inches high within one year of planting and one small maturing tree for every 30 linear feet of required planting bed. The bed shall be planted with an evergreen ground cover. 
26.5.2. General landscape requirements. 
(1)  Plant material used to fulfill these requirements must be provided with an adequate irrigation system which does not rely on drainage from the street, sidewalk, or buildings. 
(2)  All plant material must conform to the current version of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. 
(3)  The owner of any lot that becomes vacant for any reason after the date of adoption of this article shall have 180 days to either secure a building permit and begin construction of a new building or landscape the first 15 feet adjoining the public right-of-way in accordance with Section 26.5.1. 
(4)  The species of trees used must be consistent with adopted city ordinances concerning urban trees. 
(5)  Maintenance of landscaping in a healthy, neat and attractive condition is the responsibility of the owner of the property. Specifically, all plant material shall be watered, fertilized, pruned, kept free from weeds and litter, and replaced if diseased, injured or dead in a manner consistent with good horticultural practices. 
(6)  All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with Section 73.19Installation of Landscaping. 
(Ord. No. 06-1201, § 1, 1-25-2007)  
26.6. - Signs permitted. 
Signs shall be permitted in accordance with Section 72.4.3 and shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 72Sign Control Regulations.

For all single tenant, individual retail trade and multi-tenant retail trades, mixed use, and multi-family developments, shared parking is strongly encouraged. Off-street parking and loading requirement shall be provided as set forth on the following chart. 
  
Sharing factorThe sharing factor may be used to calculate the required parking for any shared parking agreement or mixed use development (defined as two dissimilar functions occurring within the same development or property, as determined by the planning department). The actual parking required is calculated by adding the total number of spaces required by each separate function and dividing the total by the appropriate factor from the Sharing Factor Table. When three or more uses share parking, the highest factor shall be used to calculate the required number of spaces. 
(Example: A residential component with 50 units requires 75 spaces while a retail component, comprised of 14,000 square feet, requires 49 spaces. Independently they would require a total of 124 spaces, but when divided by the sharing factor of 1.2, they would require only 103 spaces. Buildings may be designed to a functional density corresponding to 124 parking spaces.) 
Any available on-street and public parking, which correlates with the applicable site or development, shall be counted towards the overall parking and loading requirements. These parking spaces must be provided within 1,200 feet of the intended site or development. 
Parking shall not be permitted in any required side yard nor in the first five feet of any required rear yard. 
Required bicycle parking spaces and facilities shall be provided as set forth in Article 76 hereof.

ARTICLE 30. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PD DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. Within districts now existing or hereafter created, it is intended to permit establishment of new PD, planned development districts for specialized purposes where tracts suitable in location, area and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed on a unified basis. 
Suitability of tracts for the development proposed shall be determined primarily by reference to any applicable officially adopted plans, of the city, but due consideration shall be given to existing and prospective character of development of surrounding property. 
PD districts shall be so related to the general development pattern and the objectives of applicable officially developed plans as to provide for comfort and convenience of occupants, facilitate protection of the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and provide facilities appropriate to the needs of the city. Within PD districts, regulations adapted to such unified planning and development are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than where such regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on individual lots, and to promote economical and efficient land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design, conservation of resources, and a better environment. 
In view of the substantial public advantages of planned development, it is the intent of these regulations to promote and encourage development in this form where appropriate in location, character and timing. 
 
30.1. - Planned development, defined. 
For the purposes of these regulations, a planned development is: 
30.1.1. Land under unified control, to be planned and developed as a whole; 
30.1.2. In a single development operation or a definitely programmed series of development operations, including all access, lands and buildings; 
30.1.3. For principal and accessory structures and uses substantially related to the character and purposes of the district; 
30.1.4. According to plans that include not only sewers, drainage, streets, utilities, lots and/or building sites and the like, but also typical floor plans and elevations for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed, used and related to each other, and detailed plans for other uses and improvements on the land as related to the buildings; and 
30.1.5. With a program for provision, operation, and maintenance of such areas, improvements, facilities, and services as will be for common use by some or all of the occupants of, or visitors to, the district, but will not be provided, operated, or maintained at general public expense.  
30.2. - Relation of PD regulations to general zoning, subdivision or other regulations; variations on equal satisfaction of public purposes. 
The planned development regulations that follow shall apply generally to the initiation and regulation of all planned development districts. Where there are conflicts between the special PD regulations herein and general zoning, subdivision or other regulations or requirements, these regulations shall apply in PD districts unless the city council shall find, in the particular case, that provisions herein do not serve public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements. 
Where actions, designs, or solutions proposed by the applicant are not literally in accord with applicable PD or general regulations, but the city council makes a finding that in the particular case public purposes are satisfied to an equivalent or greater degree, council may make specific modification of the regulations in the particular case, provided that where floor area and similar ratios (other than off-street parking requirements) have been established by PD regulations, council shall not act in a particular case to modify such ratios. 
Except as indicated above, notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in effect, procedures and requirements set forth herein, and in guides and standards officially adopted as part of regulations for particular classes of PD districts, shall apply in PD districts, to any amendments creating such districts, and to issuance of all required permits therein.  
30.3. - Planned development PD districts, where permitted; how established and designated. 
Planned development PD districts may hereafter be established by amendment to the official zoning maps and related amendatory action where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed on a unified basis, according to the requirements and procedures set forth herein. 
PD districts shall be appropriately located with respect to intended function, to the pattern and timing of development existing or proposed in officially adopted plans, and to public or private facilities existing or clearly to be available at the time the development reaches the stage where they will be needed. All requirements specified in article 90, amendments, shall be met, as well as the following specific requirements: 
30.3.1. Access. PD districts shall be directly accessible from major or collector streets, and shall be so designed as to provide direct access, without creating an additional amount of traffic on local streets in adjoining residential neighborhoods that would exceed the amount of traffic created if developed under existing zoning. Local streets may be connected only when it can be certified that by doing so this will not create an unnecessary hardship within the PD district or surrounding residential areas. A traffic demand analysis must be submitted before local streets can be connected. 
30.3.2. Relation to public utilities, facilities and services; private provision or contribution. PD districts shall be located in the proximity of adequate existing or planned sanitary sewers, water lines, storm and surface drainage systems, and other utility systems and installations. 
30.3.3. Physical character of the site; relation to surrounding property. The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed, without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers, annoyances, or inconvenience. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall be appropriate to both kind and pattern of such intended development. 
If appropriate to the form of planned development, lands to be included in PD districts may be divided by streets, rights-of-way or easements, waterways or other separation, but shall be so located, dimensioned, and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding areas.  
30.4. - PD additions to PD districts. 
Where planned development additions are proposed to an existing PD district, and where the land and proposed plan of development is appropriately related to the existing PD district and provides necessary safeguards in relation to the surrounding area, PD amendments allowing such additions may be made without regard to the minimum area requirements set forth herein. Such additions may be of the same classification as the PD district being added to, or may be of another classification if the planning commission recommends and the city council approves such other classification and plans proposed therefor as complementary to the original PD district.  
30.5. - Procedures on PD amendments. 
Applications for amendment shall be submitted as for other amendments, and the following additional procedures shall be followed and requirements met: 
30.5.1. Preapplication conference. Before submitting an application for PD amendment, a prospective applicant may confer with the manager of planning or his delegated representative to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys, reports, and other data. In arranging such meetings, the manager of planning may request the attendance of such officials or agency representatives as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. No statement made or information given during such preapplication conferences shall be binding on the city or the applicant, but a record shall be kept of recommendations made, and a copy of such record shall be provided to the applicant.

In the course of such review, written findings shall be made as to the necessity for any special studies, investigations or reports needed to make determinations called for in the particular case, where existing information available to the planning division or cooperating agencies or officials is inadequate. 
30.5.4. Preliminary conferences with applicants. Following such review, unless complete conformity is found and no special studies are required, the applicant shall be notified in writing of any discrepancies, and of the willingness of the manager of planning and other appropriate officials or agencies to confer for the purposes of assisting the applicant in bringing the material submitted as nearly as possible into conformity with requirements and/or to define specific modifications of regulations or officially adopted plans that seem justified in view of equivalent services of public purposes by the proposal. 
The applicant shall also be informed of the need for any special studies, investigations or reports, and of the reasons such material is required in the circumstances of the particular case. Where the need for such special studies, investigations or reports arises as a result of a proposal for a PD district, applicants shall pay all costs incidental thereto, and the studies shall be made by the city, agencies cooperating with the city, or experts acceptable to the city. 
If the applicant does not desire to participate in such conferences, or to provide or pay the costs of any special studies, investigations or reports requested, the manager of planning shall base his report to the planning commission and city council on the application as received. 
If the applicant joins in such conferences, changes may be made in the original proposal, further conferences may be held, and additional material requested on finding of need as above. 
In the course of such preliminary conferences, any recommendations for changes shall be recorded in writing, with reasons therefor, and shall become part of the record in the case. Applicants shall indicate, in writing, their agreement to such recommendations, or their disagreement and reasons therefor; and such response by applicants shall also be included in the record. 
30.5.5. Planning division recommendations. At such time as further conferences appear unnecessary, or at any time on request of the applicant, the planning division shall prepare a report to the planning commission and city council containing findings: 
(1)  As to the suitability of the tract for the general type of PD zoning proposed, physical characteristics of the land, and relation of the proposed development to surrounding areas and existing and probable future development; 
(2)  As to relation to, and access from, major or collector roads, and to utilities and other facilities and services; 
(3)  As to adequacy of evidence on unified control and suitability of any proposed agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties, dedications, contributions, guarantees, or other instruments, or the need for such instruments, or for amendments in those proposed (with findings as to such matters based on opinions of the city attorney); 
(4)  As to the suitability of plans proposed, or the desirability of changes, with reasons therefor; and 
(5)  As to the desirable specific modifications in generally applicable regulations or officially adopted plans, as applicable in the particular case, based on determinations that such modifications are necessary or justified in the particular case by demonstration that the public purposes of PD or other regulations would be met to at least an equivalent degree by proposals of the applicant. 
Based on such findings, the planning division shall recommend to the planning commission approval of the PD amendment as proposed, approval conditioned on specific stated modifications, or disapproval, with recorded reasons therefor. 
30.5.6. Actions by planning commission, city council. Following receipt of the planning division report, the planning commission shall recommend to the city council approval of the PD amendment as proposed, approval conditioned on specific stated modifications, or disapproval with recorded reasons therefor. Where the PD development concept plan involves a subdivision of land, the planning commission may hold a public hearing on such subdivision as required by Alabama law before submitting a recommendation regarding the PD zoning proposal to city council. 
Actions by the city council shall be as for zoning amendments generally. Council may grant the application in accord with PD and other regulations applicable, may include specific modifications of PD or other applicable regulations as provided at section 30.5.5(5), or may deny the application, with written reasons for the denial. 
If amendment is granted, the city council shall in its amending action approve the preliminary development concept plan as it may have been changed during earlier procedures, or indicate required modifications, if any, which shall be binding in determinations concerning final development plans. If modifications are required, the city council shall officially state its reasons therefor in the record. 
If amendment is granted, the development shall be required to be in accord with final development plans meeting the requirements of these and other regulations, as supplemented or modified by the city council in the particular case as part of the amending action, and shall conform to any time or priority limitations established by council on beginning and completion of the development as a whole, or in specified stages. 
At the time of amendment, the city council shall pass upon the adequacy in form and substance of any agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties, or other instruments involved; and before development may proceed, such instruments shall be approved by appropriate officers and agencies. 
30.5.7. Planning commission action on approval of final plans. Not more than 90 days after the city council approves the PD rezoning, the final plan must be submitted to the planning commission or, if the planned development is to be developed in stages, then the final plan for the first stage must be submitted within 90 days after council approval. The planning commission must approve the staging of development and the following provisions must be complied with: 
(1)  In a PD, the ratio of gross floor area as initially approved or amended shall not be exceeded at any given stage of construction. 
(2)  Each stage shall be so planned and so related to existing surroundings and available facilities and services that failure to proceed to the subsequent stages will not have an adverse impact on the PD district or its surroundings at any stage of the development. 
(3)  The commencement of actual construction of any stage of the PD district shall be governed by the provisions of section 30.6. 
If the planning commission does not receive the final plan or the final plan of an approved stage within 90 days of the PD rezoning by the city council, it may take action as described in section 30.6. 
After a PD district has been established, no building permit shall be issued therein, and no grading, clearing, excavations or filling shall take place, until the planning commission has approved final plans and reports. Such approval shall be based on substantial compliance with the preliminary development concept plan, including any modifications required by the city council in its amending action, and on compliance with regulations applying at the time of rezoning, including any modification in application established by the city council. Where applicable regulations are amended following the rezoning action, applicants or their successors in interest may elect to conform to such amended regulations, subject to the same modifications if they affect such amended regulations in the same way. 
Form and content of such final plans and reports shall be as prescribed in zoning, subdivision or other lawful regulations, generally or for particular PD districts, and in rules of the planning commission and other affected agencies. 
Upon approval of final plans and reports, building permits or other required permits shall be issued in the same manner as applies generally, provided that any requirements or limitations concerning the order and location in which such permits are to be issued in the particular PD district shall be observed. 
Except as provided below, final plans and reports approved shall be binding on the applicants and any successors in title so long as PD zoning applies to the land. Final plan approval does not require formal public notice or hearing. 
30.5.8. Changes in approved final plans. Minor changes in the location, siting, and height of buildings and structures, lot and block configuration and street geometrics may be authorized by the planning commission without additional public hearings if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved. Where minor changes involve changes in an approved subdivision plat, the form and content of such changes shall meet the requirements of the subdivision regulations. No change authorized by this subsection may cause any of the following: 
(1)  A change in the primary use or character of the development; 
(2)  An increase in the intensity of use; 
(3)  An increase in the problems of traffic circulation and public utilities; 
(4)  A reduction in approved open spaces; or 
(5)  A reduction of off-street parking and loading space or required pavement widths. 
All changes other than minor changes shall be subject to review and recommendation by the planning commission, another public hearing, and further amendatory action by the city council as required for original approval.  
30.6. - Expiration of time limits in relation to PD amendments; failure to meet other requirements. 
Where time limits are set for beginning or completion of development or stages of development, or where other requirements are established in connection with a PD amendment, and where such time limits or other requirements are not met, the manager of planning shall promptly call the matter to the attention of the planning commission with a full written account of the circumstances, and the findings and recommendations of the planning division. The planning commission shall then review the case and make recommendations to the city council: 
30.6.1. That PD zoning for the entire district be continued with revised time limits; or 
30.6.2. That PD zoning be continued for part of the district, with or without revised time limits, that appropriate steps be taken to correct any deficiencies in area or open space requirements in designated portions of the district which have not been developed, and that remaining portions of the district be rezoned to an appropriate category; or 
30.6.3. That the entire district be rezoned from PD to an appropriate category; and/or 
30.6.4. That such other steps be taken as seem equitable in the circumstances of the case and will appropriately protect the public interest. 
Such recommendations shall include proposals for appropriate action concerning any legal instruments in the case.

31.4. - Site planning, external relationships. 
Site planning within the district shall provide protection of the development from potentially adverse surrounding influences, and protection of surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences within the development including prevention of excessive storm drainage in runoff peaks. In particular: 
31.4.1. Principal vehicular access points. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes and/or traffic dividers shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. Minor streets shall not be directly connected with streets outside the district in such a way as to encourage use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic. 
31.4.2. Access for pedestrians and bicycles. Access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving the district shall be by safe and convenient routes. Such access need not be adjacent to, or limited to the vicinity of, access points for automotive vehicles. Where there are crossings of pedestrian ways and vehicular routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safely located, marked, and controlled; and where such ways are exposed to substantial automotive traffic at edges of districts, safeguards including fencing may be required to prevent crossings except at designated points. Bicycle and/or bridle paths, if provided, shall be so related to the pedestrian system that street crossings are combined. 
31.4.3. Protection of visibility; automotive traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians. Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians shall be as generally provided at section 73.10, corner visibility. In addition, where there is pedestrian, bicycle, or equestrian access from within the development to a street at its edges by paths across yards or other open space without a barrier to access to the street, no material impediment to visibility, as defined therein, shall be created or maintained within areas appropriate to the circumstances of the case, but in any event within a visibility triangle equivalent to that required in section 73.10. 
31.4.4. Uses adjacent to single-family residence districts. If a PD-H district adjoins a single-family residence district, then either: 
(1)  The portion of the perimeter of the PD-H district so adjoining shall be planned and developed only for uses permitted in the adjoining residential district and in accordance with all other requirements for such district; or 
(2)  Common open space for the PD-H district to a depth of 100 feet from the district boundary shall be provided. No intensive recreational use or off-street parking shall be permitted within 75 feet of the district boundary in such cases. 
31.4.5. Yards, fences, walls, or vegetative screening at edges of PD-H districts. Yards, fences, walls, or vegetative screening shall be provided at edges of PD-H districts where needed to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise, or other off-site influences, or to protect residential occupants of other districts from similar adverse influences within the PD-H district. In particular, extensive off-street parking areas, service areas for loading and unloading vehicles other than passenger, and areas for storage and collection of refuse and garbage shall be screened. 
31.4.6. Height limitations at edges of PD-H districts. Except along boundaries where adjoining districts permit greater heights within similar areas, no portion of any building in such district shall project through imaginary planes leaning inward from district boundaries at an angle representing an increase in height for each foot of horizontal distance perpendicular to the boundary as follows: Adjacent to Residence 1, 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, 2 and 2-C districts, 0.5 foot; adjacent to other districts, 1.0 foot. 
31.4.7. Signs visible from outside PD-H districts. No signs visible from outside PD-H districts shall be erected within such district other than not to exceed two signs identifying the development, with total combined maximum surface area not to exceed 50 square feet, at each principal entrance. In addition, during the process of construction and initial sale or rental within such development, temporary announcement signs may be allowed by special permit only, issued by the zoning administrator for periods not exceeding one year, and renewable for one-year terms but not to exceed two additional years. 
Such temporary signs shall not exceed two, with combined maximum surface area not exceeding 100 square feet for each principal entrance. Such signs shall be located at least ten feet from any property line, and oriented for minimum adverse effects on adjoining or facing residential property. Location shall be further governed by requirements for vision clearance at intersections as set forth at section 73.10. 
(Ord. No. 07-460, § 2, 6-28-2007)  
31.5. - Site planning, internal relationships. 
The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses, and facilities, for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features, and for preservation of desirable natural or historic features and minimum disturbance of natural topography. In particular: 
31.5.1. Streets, drives, parking and service areas. Streets, drives, parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and general facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be so laid out as to encourage outside traffic to traverse the development on local streets, nor occupy more land than is required to provide access as indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the development into small blocks. In general, block size shall be the maximum consistent with use and shape of the site and the convenience and safety of occupants. 
31.5.2. Vehicular access to streets. Vehicular access to streets shall be limited and controlled as follows: 
(1)  Streets or portions of streets serving 50 or fewer dwelling units. If the street or portion thereof serves 50 or fewer dwelling or lodging units, vehicular access from off-street parking and service areas may be directly to the street from the sites of individual dwelling or lodging units. Determination of number of units served shall be based on normal routes of traffic anticipated in the development. 
(2)  Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets. Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets from off-street parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located, designed, and controlled as to channel traffic from and to such areas conveniently, safely, and in a manner that minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free flow of traffic on streets without excessive interruption. 
31.5.3. Ways for pedestrians and cyclists; use by emergency or service vehicles. Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, appropriate project facilities, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations. Maximum walking distance in the open between dwelling units and parking areas, delivery areas, and refuse and garbage storage areas shall not exceed 150 feet. 
Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children as play areas or as routes to school or other destinations shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contact with normal automotive traffic. If substantial bicycle traffic is anticipated, bicycle paths shall be coordinated with the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on walkways, bicycle paths, and/or bridle trails and shall be located and designed to promote safety and appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. 
Pedestrian ways and bicycle paths, appropriately located, designed, and constructed, may be combined with other easements and used by emergency and service vehicles, but shall not be used by other automotive traffic, including motorbikes and motorcycles. 
31.5.4. Protection of visibility; automotive traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians. Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians shall be as provided at section 31.4.3.  
31.6. - Open space and spacing of buildings or portions of buildings containing dwelling or lodging units. 
Definitions, rules for interpretation, and requirements and limitations concerning open space and spacing of buildings or portions of buildings containing dwelling or lodging units shall be as provided at section 73.16.

ARTICLE 45. - HEAVY MANUFACTURING DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The purpose of the heavy manufacturing district is to provide sites suitable for the operation of those industries engaged in the mechanical or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. These operations frequently require large tracts of land suitable for the external storage of both raw materials or components and finished products, and their physical plants may incorporate various towers, tanks and other external mechanical devices. It is the intent of this article to protect appropriate lands from the intrusion of incompatible uses while establishing regulations that would permit manufacturing companies to function in near proximity to dissimilar uses. To achieve this goal, these regulations require a minimum ten-acre lot size, generous yard setbacks based on the compatibility of adjacent uses, landscape screening of outdoor storage and operations, and performance standards. 
The heavy manufacturing district regulations are intended to promote the health, safety, welfare, comfort and convenience of the users of this district as well as of the inhabitants of the surrounding districts.

ARTICLE 46. - INDUSTRIAL PARK DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The purpose of the industrial park district is to provide sites for manufacturing, recycling, warehousing and industrial operations within the city that possess a moderate level of site amenities through perimeter landscaping, street setbacks, restrictions on outdoor operations, and screening of storage.

ARTICLE 61. - DISPOSAL-STORAGE DISTRICT REGULATIONS[9] 
Purpose. The purpose of this disposal-storage district is to provide a special type of use district for those industries who, by their nature and operation, could have an adverse effect on residential, commercial, or other industrial uses. 
The disposal-storage district is established for the protection of these types of uses from the encroachment of residential and other commercial or industrial uses which would be adverse to the operation and expansion of these types of uses and at the same time to reduce to a minimum the influence of these types of uses on surrounding residential or commercial uses. 
It is the intent of this district to be composed primarily of lands deep within the industrial areas of the city away from residential and commercial areas. These regulations are the minimum required for the mutual protection of the industrial users, and to that end, the district should not be adjacent to any residential or business districts, if such abutment can possibly be avoided. 
Within a disposal-storage district as shown on the official Zoning Maps of the City of Huntsville, the following regulations shall apply:

ARTICLE 62. - FLOOD HAZARD DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The flood hazard areas of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The market value of the building should be either: 
(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair, or improvement; or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

62.12.1. The city engineer shall review petitions for variances and report his findings to the board of zoning adjustment. 
62.12.2. Variances shall not be granted within any designated floodway district if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result or if hazardous streamflow velocities would result, except under the conditions enumerated in section 62.12.3. 
62.12.3. Conditions for variances. Variances shall only be issued: 
(1)  Upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. 
(2)  Upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. 
(3)  Upon a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in unnecessary hardship unique and different from that shared or suffered by adjacent and similar property also in the designated floodway. 
(4)  Upon a determination based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered engineer that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood levels, floodway widths or hazardous streamflow velocities during a base flood discharge. Neither will the variance create additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense or nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, nor conflict with existing local laws or ordinances with respect to the use to which the property is to be put. 
(5)  For any building or structure in existence prior to the effective date of this article that is hereafter destroyed or substantially damaged to 50 percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction by any means if the reconstruction does not exceed the volume and external dimensions of the original structure and does not offer any greater obstruction to the flow of floodwater than did the original structure. 
(6)  For the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(7)  For new construction on an isolated lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in residential subdivisions recorded prior to the effective date of this ordinance. 
(8)  For the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood. 
62.12.4. Standards for evaluating variance applications by the board of adjustment. In passing upon such applications, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
62.12.5. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the board of zoning adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
62.12.6. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
62.12.7. The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

The various zones are hereby established, defined and adopted as follows: 
63.5.1. Instrument approach-departure zones. These zones are established at each end of the runways for instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach-departure zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of each runway and thereafter remaining at a width of 16,000 feet to the terminal end of the zone, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
63.5.2. Transitional zones. These zones extend outward from both sides of the primary surface and the approach-departure zones to an intersection with the inner horizontal, conical and outer horizontal zones or other transitional zones. 
63.5.3. Inner horizontal zone. This zone is established as the area commencing at the periphery of the transitional zones of the airport and extending outwardly and horizontally to a perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of the airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. This zone does not include the instrument approach-departure zones and transitional zones. 
63.5.4. Conical zone. This zone is established commencing at the periphery of the inner horizontal zone of the airport and extending outward and upward for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. This zone does not include the instrument approach-departure zones and the transitional zones. 
63.5.5. Outer horizontal zone. This zone is established as the area commencing at the periphery of the conical zones of the airport and extending outwardly and horizontally to the periphery of the airport hazard area. This zone does not include the instrument approach-departure zones and transitional zones. 
63.5.6. Airport noise exposure zones. These zones are land use areas lying within 3,000 feet outward and perpendicular to each side of each runway centerline and its extension and 25,000 feet outward from the end of runway 18R; 25,350 feet outward from the end of runway 36L; 25,350 feet outward from runway 18L; and 25,000 feet outward from the end of runway 36R.  
63.6. - Criteria to govern height limitations. 
Except as otherwise permitted in this article, no structure or tree shall hereafter be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained (in any zone created by this article) to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. Such height limitations are computed from imaginary surfaces referenced to the airport elevation. The imaginary surface established for each of the zones in question is as follows: 
63.6.1. Instrument approach-departure surface runway 18R. This surface slopes one foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at an elevation of 628 feet above mean sea level and a distance of 1,000 feet outward and 200 feet from the end of the runway. This surface slopes outward and upward from its beginning, symmetrically about the extended centerline of the runway until the width reaches 16,000 feet, continuing at this width to 133,200 feet beyond the end of the runway, which is the Alabama-Tennessee line. 
63.6.2. Instrument approach-departure surface runway 36L. This surface slopes one foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at an elevation of 614 feet above mean sea level and a distance of 1,000 feet outward and 200 feet from the end of the runway. This surface slopes outward and upward from its beginning, symmetrically about the extended centerline of the runway until the width reaches 16,000 feet, continuing at this width to 115,550 feet beyond the end of the runway, which is the Morgan-Cullman County line. 
63.6.3. Instrument approach-departure surface runway 18L. This surface slopes one foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at an elevation of 606 feet above mean sea level and a distance of 1,000 feet outward and 200 feet from the end of the runway. This surface slopes outward and upward from its beginning, symmetrically about the extended centerline of the runway until the width reaches 16,000 feet, continuing at this width to 133,550 feet beyond the end of the runway, which is the Alabama-Tennessee line. 
63.6.4. Instrument approach-departure surface runway 36R. This surface slopes one foot in height for each 100 feet in horizontal distance beginning at an elevation of 591 feet above mean sea level and a distance of 1,000 feet outward and 200 feet from the end of the runway. This surface slopes outward and upward from its beginning, symmetrically about the extended centerline of the runway until the width reaches 16,000 feet, continuing at this width to 117,200 feet beyond the end of the runway, which is the Morgan-Cullman County line. 
63.6.5. Transitional surface. These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of one foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance from the sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the instrument approach-departure surfaces. The maximum elevation for structures or trees located thereunder shall be the elevation of the adjacent point on the primary surface or the instrument approach-departure surface plus one seventh of the distance which separates the structure or tree from the slope of the primary or instrument approach-departure surface. The distance shall be measured in feet along the perpendicular to the landing strip or its extended centerline. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the instrument approach-departure zone surfaces which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach-departure surface and at right angles to the runway centerline. 
63.6.6. Inner horizontal surface. This surface is at a height of 150 feet above the established airport elevation. The maximum elevation of structures or trees located thereunder shall be 778 feet above mean sea level. 
63.6.7. Conical surface. This surface extends outward and upward at a slope of one foot in height for each 20 feet in horizontal distance. The maximum elevation of structures or trees located thereunder shall be 778 feet plus 1/20 of the distance which separates the structure or tree from the periphery of the inner horizontal surface. The distance shall be measured in feet along a radial from the nearest point on the periphery of the inner horizontal zone. 
63.6.8. Outer horizontal surface. This surface is at a height of 500 feet above the established airport elevation. The maximum elevation of structures or trees located thereunder shall be 978 feet above mean sea level.  
63.7. - Criteria to govern compatible land use in airport noise exposure zone. 
The airport noise compatibility program, as reflected by the airport noise exposure map previously made part of this regulation, establishes the "Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level (Ldn)" in decibels, in contours around the airport. Land uses around the airport must be compatible with the standards and procedures as set forth in 14 CFR 150, appendix A, Federal Aviation Regulations, published January, 1981, as amended. No use shall hereafter be permitted within the boundaries of the airport noise exposure zone unless the said use shall be otherwise permitted in the applicable area under this ordinance and shall be compatible with the Ldn in the applicable area. Compatibility of the use with the Ldn shall be determined by the standards set forth in 14 CFR 150, appendix A, table 2, Federal Aviation Regulations, as amended. Said part 150, Federal Aviation Regulations, as amended, and specifically table 2 of appendix A thereto is incorporated herein and made a part hereof by reference. A copy of part 150 is on public record in the Office of the City Clerk-Treasurer for the City of Huntsville, Alabama. 
If varying uses of a site with different sensitivity to noise are applied for, compatibility of the uses with the Ldn shall be determined based on the use most adversely affected by noise, without regard to which of the proposed uses is the major use of the site. When appropriate, noise level reduction through incorporation of sound attenuation into the design and construction of a structure may be permitted to achieve a level of compatibility as provided in part 150, supra, and incorporated herein by reference. 
All applications for compatible land uses within the airport noise exposure zone shall be accompanied by an aviagation easement, in substantially the form and letter as set forth in exhibit A to this regulation, which said exhibit A is incorporated herein by reference, duly executed by all the owners of the land for which application is being made.  
63.8. - Use restrictions. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with a radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off, maneuvering of aircraft, or impair approach and departure procedures.  
63.9. - Nonconforming uses. 
The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the structure, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this article and is diligently executed.  
63.10. - Permits. 
63.10.1. Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure shall be erected, altered or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been obtained from the director of the inspection department of the City of Huntsville, Alabama (building inspector). Each application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning administrator and shall state clearly the purpose for which the permit is requested, with sufficient particularity to permit the determination of whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the following: 
(1)  All regulations herein prescribed and all other applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Huntsville, Alabama; 
(2)  Subpart B: Notice of Construction or Alteration, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, Federal Aviation Regulations, as or may be amended, copy of which is maintained on file and available to the public for examination at the Office of the City Clerk-Treasurer for the City of Huntsville, Alabama; and 
(3)  Part 150, Noise Compatibility, Federal Aviation Regulations, as or may be amended, copy of which is maintained on file and available to the public for examination at the office of the city clerk-treasurer for the City of Huntsville, Alabama. Specifically, the application must contain certification from a duly qualified professional registered engineer or architect that the proposed use is compatible with the "Yearly Day-Night Average Sound Level" (Ldn) as prescribed in Table 2, Appendix A, Part 150, Federal Aviation Regulations. 
If the zoning administrator determines the proposed use or structure or object is in conformance with each of the foregoing provisions (except as any provisions thereof may be mutually exclusive), then the application will be forwarded to the building inspector for issuance of the permit. 
63.10.2. Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an aircraft hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendment thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
63.10.3. Abandonment or destruction of nonconforming uses, structures or objects. Whenever the zoning administrator shall determine that a nonconforming use has been abandoned or discontinued for a period of six months or more; or that more than 50 percent of a nonconforming structure or tree has been destroyed, torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed; then the application with the written determination of the zoning administrator is forwarded to the building inspector and no permit shall be granted to allow such use to be continued, and no permit shall be granted to allow the continuation of the nonconforming structure or tree in non-compliance with this regulation or ordinance. 
63.10.4. Variances. Any person desiring to use property within any zone created hereunder in violation of the regulations herein adopted or otherwise contained in this ordinance, or to erect or maintain a structure or to permit the growth of any tree in violation thereof, may, upon denial of a permit of the manager of inspection, apply to the Board of Zoning Adjustment of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, for a variance from the zoning regulation or regulations in question. Such variances shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this chapter; provided that any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. 
The board of adjustment shall have all the powers and duties under this article as conferred upon it by article 92 of this ordinance, to the extent authorized, required or permitted by Code of Ala. 1975, § 4-6-10. 
63.10.5. Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permit or variance under this section, the manager of inspection or the board of zoning adjustment, as the case may be, may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard, upon payment to the owner for all damage resulting to his property by such maintenance.

Applications for variances under this article shall be filed with the zoning administrator who shall set the same down for hearing before the board of zoning adjustment. 
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning adjustment made in its administration of regulations adopted under this article or any governing body of a political subdivision which is of the opinion that a decision of such board is an improper application of airport zoning regulations of concern to such governing body or board may appeal to the circuit court of the county where such airport is located for a trial de novo. 
All appeals taken under this section must be taken within ten days by filing with the board from which the appeal is taken a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The board from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the court all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. 
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the board from which the appeal is taken certifies to the court, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property and file bond to indemnify the owner for damages as may be fixed by the court. In such cases, proceedings may be stayed upon the filing by the appellant of a supersedeas bond in an amount to be set by the circuit court of the county in which the subject matter of such decision lies on application by the appellant or the board from which the appeal is taken. 
The court may, in conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse, affirm wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the board from which the appeal is taken.

Editor's note Ord. No. 96-159, adopted April 25, 1996, deleted former ch. VI, art. 65, of the zoning ordinance and added new provisions as ch. VI, art. 65, as herein set out. Former ch. VI, art. 65, pertained to mountainside development district regulations and derived unamended from the original zoning ordinance. 
 
65.1. - Establishment of the slope development district. 
The boundaries and designations of the slope development district are hereby established and approved as defined herein and as shown and designated on the official zoning maps of the City of Huntsville, Alabama. 
65.1.1. The slope development district boundary has been established at the elevation contour immediately above or below which a 25-foot vertical span of mountainside has a slope of 15 percent or greater and the district is to include those contiguous parts of mountains or hills that exhibit at least 100 feet of relief as measured from the lowest elevation contour that bounds the 15 percent or greater slope to the highest contour of the district as defined herein. In addition, the upper boundary shall be extended 50 feet (horizontal distance) beyond the elevation contour immediately below which a 25-foot vertical span exhibits a slope of 15 percent or greater. 
65.1.2. When a lot is divided by the Slope Development District boundary line, the lot shall be considered as lying wholly within the district unless it satisfies the following conditions: 
(1)  That portion of the lot lying within the slope development district shall remain undisturbed and shall have a restriction placed on the final plat requiring that it be retained in its natural state except for hiking trails, and 
(2)  That portion of the lot lying outside the slope development district shall be of sufficient size and shape to meet all the minimum yard setback, lot area, and lot width requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
If the option is taken to remove a divided lot from the authority of the slope development district regulations, then no part of the divided lot shall be included in the impervious cover calculations for the subdivision of which it is a part. 
65.1.3. The slope development district boundary is shown and designated on a 1:4800 scale map (one inch equals 400 feet) having contour intervals of five feet. Slope percentage is calculated perpendicular to contours over a 25-foot vertical span. The boundary is delineated perpendicular to slope on the five-foot contour lines and parallel to slope between contour lines. Local variations in slope that continue for horizontal distances of less than 200 feet parallel to contour lines are not shown by adjustments in the district boundary. 
65.1.4. In the event of a discrepancy between the mapped district boundary and the surveyed district boundary, the surveyed boundary line shall prevail, provided the following certification is made part of the slope map submitted for development approval: 
I, ___________, do hereby certify that I am a licensed land surveyor in Huntsville, Alabama, that I have surveyed the lands embraced within ( development name ), that the contours shown hereon accurately describe the natural, undisturbed topography of the site existing prior to the development, and that the boundaries of the slope development district as shown hereon have been established in conformance with the provisions of section 65.1.1 of the Huntsville Zoning Ordinance.

65.2. - Application. 
The slope development district is created as a special zoning classification to be superimposed on other existing zoning districts contained in the zoning ordinance of the City of Huntsville. Except where in conflict with the specific requirements of the slope development district, the permitted and accessory uses and all other requirements shall be as determined by the regulations of the basic underlying district contained elsewhere. All requirements for the slope development district, where superimposed on other existing zoning districts otherwise contained in the zoning ordinance of the City of Huntsville, shall be uniform for each class or kind of building, structure or improvement throughout the slope development district. 
(Ord. No. 96-159, 4-25-1996)  
65.3. - Zones of the slope development district. 
The slope development district is hereby divided into two slope zones based on the increasing risk of instability and the decreasing safety factor associated with increasing slope as established by the Slope Development Study, Huntsville, Alabama, prepared by Ground Engineering and Testing Service, Inc., 1989. The zones are defined as follows: 
65.3.1. Lower slope zone. This zone shall include all areas of land within the boundaries of the slope development district that are not part of the upper slope zone. 
65.3.2. Upper slope zone. This zone shall include all areas of land within the boundaries of the slope development district beginning at the elevation contour defining the start of the 20 percent slope and encompassing all contiguous slopes of 20 percent or greater. The upper slope zone boundary shall be computed according to the procedure described in section 65.1.3 herein, where a 25-foot vertical span of mountainside has a slope of 20 percent or greater. The upper slope zone may begin at the lower district boundary, may extend to the upper district boundary if present, or may create one or more enclosed areas delineated by a continuous extension of the upper slope zone boundary. 
65.3.3. If a lot is cut by the boundary contour separating the lower and upper slope zones, then the lot shall be considered to be a part of that slope zone in which the majority of its area is located. 
65.3.4. Hazard zone. This zone shall include all areas of land within the boundaries of the Slope Development District that exhibit any or all of the following geologic or man-made hazards: 
(1)  Pennington, shaley Upper Bangor, or Pride Mountain geologic formations; 
(2)  Colluvial deposits having a depth of five feet or greater or being contiguous to an off-site colluvial deposit that exceeds five feet in depth; and 
(3)  Evidence of mining operations (mine or quarry tailings, or similar geologic conditions). 
65.3.5. For colluvial deposits present on a site to be removed from the hazard zone provisions, the following certification must be made a part of the site assessment map: 
I, ___________, the geotechnical engineer of record, having caused investigations to be performed and based on the findings of said investigations, do hereby certify that the colluvial deposits identified by location and extent on this map are less than five feet in depth and are not contiguous to any off-site colluvial deposit that exceeds five feet in depth.

65.3.6. No buildings, structures or improvements shall be constructed, erected or placed on any land having a hazard zone designation, except where: 
(1)  Such site has undergone additional geotechnical analysis and testing both upslope to where a potential landslide would begin and downslope to where a potential landslide would end, and 
(2)  The engineer of record places the following signed certification on the final subdivision plat or, in the case of a multifamily development, on the site plan: 
I, ___________ the engineer of record, certify that the proposed development shown hereon is designed in accordance with sound engineering standards and practices, and in accordance with all applicable development regulations. I further certify that I have caused prudent investigation, testing and inspections to be performed on all lands within the proposed development identified as hazard zone, as defined by the zoning ordinance of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, including geotechnical analysis and testing on all hazard zone lands and on lands upslope and downslope of the proposed development, and I have instructed the land surveyor as to those areas within the proposed development that fall within the hazard zone for inclusion in the development plats. Based upon the investigation, testing and inspections performed, as defined and discussed in the geotechnical analysis and report dated ________ and submitted in connection herewith, and further based upon any remedial measures taken in connection with the hazards defined therein, I certify that, within acceptable geotechnical standards, development of the property as shown on the plat will not diminish the stability of the slope or otherwise increase the likelihood of landslide or other slope failure and that the buildable areas designated hereon can meet a minimum safety factor of 1.5 for stability.

65.5. - Development standards. 
65.5.1. Grading. 
(1)  Natural slopes in excess of 35 percent shall not be graded except as needed to provide for utility service to developable areas of less than 35 percent slope and/or other officially adopted public facilities except that in no case shall any building or structure be allowed. 
(2)  Grading on natural slopes of 25 percent or greater shall only be permitted for the construction and installation of roads, utilities, and other limited foundation grading, which can be shown to be sensitive to the existing terrain. Proposed structures on slopes of 25 percent to 35 percent shall be designed to conform to the terrain and shall utilize pier and beam, step, or other such foundations that require only limited excavation and filling. Areas of cut visible from any public right-of-way shall be screened by landscaping except in those cases where visible cuts in stable rock are impractical to screen. 
(3)  No cut and no fill shall be allowed on any lot except for: 
(a)  The construction of a primary use structure when the cut or fill is required for the construction of the building foundation, in which case the total area of such cut or fill, as measured from the exterior faces of the walls of the structure to the outer limits of the cut or fill, must be subtracted from the allotted amount of landscaped yard area as defined in section 65.5.3; 
(b)  The construction of a driveway or parking area to access the primary use structure, in which case the total area of such cut or fill, as measured from the outer edges of the driveway or parking area to the outer limits of the cut or fill, must be subtracted from the allotted amount of landscaped yard area as defined in section 65.5.3; 
(c)  The construction of utilities, provided all said areas of cut are restored to natural grade and revegetated to conform to the character of the surrounding natural terrain. In order to reduce grading disturbance during utility installation, all utilities shall be incorporated in common trenches, where practical, utilizing duct banks designed and constructed to current standards of Huntsville Utilities as the same may from time to time be amended; or 
(d)  The testing of land, as required by the regulations of the City of Huntsville, or other bona fide geotechnical or geological testing provided that a testing plan consistent with the provisions of the subdivision regulations of the City of Huntsville is submitted to and approved by the zoning administrator prior to any cut or fill operation. 
(4)  Mass grading of hilltops, ridges, and ravines shall be prohibited. 
(5)  All slopes to be stabilized shall conform to the surrounding natural terrain and shall be revegetated so as to conform to the natural character of the surrounding area. 
65.5.2. Environmental features. 
(1)  Road alignment shall follow natural terrain wherever possible and no unnecessary cuts or fills shall be allowed for the sole purpose of creating additional lots or building sites. 
(2)  A restricted use area shall extend a minimum of 50 feet from the following features: 
(a)  Landslides. Setback measured from mapped boundary of landslide. 
(b)  Perennial streams and major drainageways including, but not limited to, all streams and drainageways delineated by the U.S. Geological Survey and Tennessee Valley Authority on the 7.5 minute quadrangle topographic map series. Drainageways that have been modified by man or by natural processes so that they are different from those delineated on the 7.5 minute quadrangle maps shall be set back from as defined herein. In addition, some man-made drainageways as designated by the city engineer shall be set back from as defined herein. 
The 50-foot setbacks shall extend landward from the banks or normal high water points of the drainageways. 
(c)  Bluffs of greater than 20 feet of relief. Setbacks shall extend from a line defining the top and bottom of said bluff. 
(3)  A restricted use area shall extend a minimum of 25 feet from the following features: 
(a)  Cave entrances. Setback measured from edge of cave entrance. 
(b)  Sinkholes. Setback measured from edge of those sinkholes that exhibit three feet or greater depth of closed depression. 
(c)  Perennial springs. Setback measured from perimeter of spring. 
(d)  Abandoned quarries. Setbacks shall extend from the top and bottom of quarry face. 
(e)  Historical and archeological sites. Setbacks shall extend from the boundaries of significant historical or archeological sites as determined by the Alabama Historical Commission. 
(f)  Wetlands. Setbacks shall extend from the boundary of the wetland. 
(4)  Areas within the above minimum setbacks shall be retained in their existing state and be restricted from all development except for hiking trails, provided such trails neither create nor increase a public hazard, and except for certain minimal grading within said setback, provided the following conditions are met: 
(a)  Minimal grading is required to construct public utility service and/or roadways to adjacent properties; and 
(b)  No technically feasible alternative route or construction method exists. 
(5)  The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed, without hazards to persons or property on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosions, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other geologic dangers. Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall be appropriate to both kind and pattern of such intended development. 
(6)  The natural terrain shall not be disturbed, cut, filled, graded or rearranged by either the developer or subsequent property owners beyond that necessary for the construction of buildings and infrastructure to the extent herein permitted. 
65.5.3. Landscaping. It is desirable that yards be maintained in a condition close to their natural state in order to reduce the potential negative impacts of stormwater runoff, erosion and sedimentation, chemical fertilizer pollution, and irrigation that are commonly associated with the establishment of lawns and other plantings not native to the mountain slopes; however, a landscaped yard may be created provided the following conditions are met: 
(1)  In the lower slope zone, 70 percent of the lot shall be retained in its natural state. 
(2)  In the upper slope zone, 80 percent of the lot shall be retained in its natural state unless the lot lies on a slope of 25 percent or greater, in which case the entire lot beyond the allotment for impervious cover shall be retained in its natural state. 
(3)  Land lying within utility and drainage easements that is disrupted by installation or maintenance of public improvements shall not be counted as disturbed lot area for the purpose of section 65.5.3. 
(4)  Natural state shall mean the original condition of the land prior to any development or other human disturbance. No grading, excavating, or filling and no construction of roads, driveways, parking areas or structures shall be allowed. No tree cutting shall be allowed except for sick or damaged trees or trees that create a health or safety hazard. Unpaved hiking trails may be permitted as may additional plantings of native trees, shrubs and wildflowers that would be compatible with and enhance the natural environment. 
(5)  The allotted area of landscaped yard must be decreased by the amount of any areas of cut or fill utilized in construction of the primary use structure and/or driveway/parking areas that have not been finished with impervious cover or returned to their natural state through revegetation that conforms to the character of the surrounding natural terrain. 
(6)  The majority of the landscaped area should be located on that portion of the lot which is upslope from the primary use structure in order to minimize the harmful effects of increased pollution, runoff and erosion on downslope properties. 
(7)  Fill material that is imported to provide a base for landscape plantings shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary and no colluvial soil shall be used for fill. 
(8)  Turf grass and other imported ground covers shall not be planted on colluvial soil. 
(9)  Trees may be removed: 
(a)  Within rights-of-way to allow road construction; 
(b)  Along easements if necessary for construction of said utility; 
(c)  As necessary to conduct geotechnical testing after approval of the testing plan by the zoning administrator. 
(d)  Within the areas of cut or fill required for construction of primary use structures, driveways and parking areas; 
(e)  On that portion of a lot not required to be maintained in its natural state; and 
(f)  To eliminate sick or damaged trees or trees that create a health or safety hazard. 
(10)  Tree topping and clear cutting are prohibited within the slope development district. 
(Ord. No. 96-159, 4-25-1996; Ord. No. 07-460, § 5, 6-28-2007)

65.6.1. Lots of record. Where a lot, as defined in section 3.1, exists wholly within the slope development district or its buildable area is cut by the slope development district boundary and it was recorded in the office of the probate judge in the county where said lot is situated prior to the time of adoption of this article, then such lot is excluded from the regulations of this article, except for: 
(1)  Building heights for all single-family residential lots of record shall not exceed more than 45 feet at any point as measured vertically from the natural grade prior to development to the highest point of the roof. The number of stories permitted shall not exceed 2½ stories. 
Building heights for all multifamily and nonresidential lots of record shall not exceed 35 feet (35') at any point as measured vertically from the natural grade prior to development to the highest point of the roof. 
(2)  Certification to the manager of inspection prior to the issuance of a building permit that the proposed building site and structure can meet a minimum safety factor of 1.5 for stability; 
(3)  Certification to the manager of inspection prior to the issuance of a building permit that the proposed site can meet a minimum safety factor of 3.0 for bearing capacity of the underlying soil; and 
(4)  Certification to the manager of inspection prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy that the completed building or structure meets a minimum safety factor of 1.5. 
65.6.2. Existing structures. Where a lawful structure exists within the slope development district or has been issued a building permit by the manager of inspection prior to the date of adoption of this article, then such structure is excluded from the regulations of this article except when an addition is undertaken that would enlarge the footprint of the existing structure. In such case, the manager of inspection may require certifications as defined in section 65.6.1 above. 
(Ord. No. 96-159, 4-25-1996)  
65.7. - Variances and special exceptions. 
Applications for variances and special exceptions from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city zoning administrator, who shall forward such application to the city engineer, who shall review the application and report his findings to the zoning administrator for a decision. An appeal of the zoning administrator's decision may be filed with the board of zoning adjustment as provided in article 92 of the zoning ordinance of the City of Huntsville. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that an unnecessary hardship exists on the subject property, unique or different from that shared or suffered by adjacent or similarly situated property within the slope development district, or as otherwise permitted by section 92.5.4 of this article and by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80.

The following signs being maintained are on the effective date of this ordinance hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall be brought into compliance according to the following schedule: 
72.7.1. All signs constructed upon or overhanging any public street or highway, sidewalk excluded, and any sign that fails to meet the then-currently adopted technical code wind load requirements, shall be removed by the owner or persons responsible for same within 90 days after the effective date of this ordinance, and thereafter it shall be unlawful for any such person to keep or maintain such sign except in conformity with this ordinance. 
72.7.2. All signs that do not conform to the size limitations of this article must be removed or brought into conformance herewith within three years from the effective date of this article, except as hereinafter provided: 
(1)  The zoning administrator of the City of Huntsville, Alabama or his authorized representative shall notify, in writing, the owner, or his agent, of any sign which does not conform to the requirements and limitations of this article, stating that the sign in question does not conform herewith, the reasons and specifications which make the sign nonconforming, and the date by which the sign must be removed or made to conform under the terms of this article, which said date shall be three years from the effective date of this article. 
(2)  The owner of such nonconforming sign, or his agent, may within 90 days of the date of the receipt of the written notice from the zoning administrator, as set forth in paragraph (1), above, file a written objection to the literal enforcement of the three-year limitation as set out in the written notice from the zoning administrator. Said written objection shall be filed in the Office of the Director of the Planning Department of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, and shall be substantially in the form designated by the zoning administrator for such objections, and shall specifically include the following information: 
(a)  Photograph of each face and the supporting structure of the sign. 
(b)  Spot survey, or other drawing acceptable to the manager of inspection, showing the correct address of the said sign and its location on the said property. 
(c)  The name and address of the owner of the said sign, and of the owner of the property on which the sign is situated. 
(d)  A copy of the ground lease, if any, permitting the location of the sign on the subject property. 
(e)  A certified statement from the owner or his agent stating the age of said sign, its original cost (to the owner making the application), the date the present owner acquired ownership, any repair or alteration done by the present owner to enhance the value of the sign (not including ordinary maintenance), the current market value of the said sign, the amount of depreciation claimed by the owner for tax purposes against the said sign, the annual gross revenue from the sign reported for tax purposes, the operating and maintenance expenses of the said sign directly chargeable to the said sign, and a statement detailing what portion or percentage of signs owned by applicant are nonconforming and subject to this section. 
(f)  If the ordinance requires the sign to be reduced in size, the projected cost to the owner for such reduction, and the projected fair market value of said sign after reduction. 
(g)  The period of time which the owner claims is necessary to amortize the cost of reduction of the sign, or the removal of the said sign, as the case may be, to justly compensate the owner therefor. The owner or agent should give a full explanation of how this figure is derived. 
(h)  The salvage value of any portion of the nonconforming sign not utilized in the conforming sign (including sign structure). 
(i)  Any other reasonable costs owner may sustain. 
(j)  Any other pertinent information owner or agent may choose to submit. 
(k)  Any other information that the zoning administrator may require. 
(3)  Any owner, or his agent, who fails to file a written objection to the three-year amortization period established by this article within the 90-day period following receipt of the notice as set forth in paragraph (1) above shall be conclusively presumed to have waived further right of appeal or protest of the three-year amortization period allowed by this article. 
(4)  After receipt of a written objection to the application of the three-year amortization period to a particular sign, the zoning administrator shall establish a reasonable plan for termination of the nonconforming use, but the plan shall not amortize the nonconforming use for a period of less than three years. In determining a reasonable plan for termination, the zoning administrator may consider the information submitted in the written objection pursuant to this article, together with such other information as may be available to him and pertinent to such issue. Within 90 days of the date of the filing of the objection, the zoning administrator shall make a factual determination of the reasonable fair market value and economic life of the said nonconforming sign, and he shall establish, according to his findings, the time during which said nonconforming sign shall be allowed to remain under the provisions of this article. In no event shall any nonconforming sign under this article be amortized for a period longer than seven years. 
(5)  On or before the end of the amortization period as determined by the zoning administrator, the owner or person responsible for the said sign shall cause the same to be removed, or to comply with the provisions of this article. Except for maintenance, there shall be no alteration of the sign during the established amortization period, and at any time said sign repairs or alterations of more than 50 percent of its then remaining economic value, then said sign shall immediately become unlawful and shall thereupon be made to conform to the requirements of this article, or be removed by the owner or person responsible for said sign. 
(6)  An appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator concerning the period of amortization for a nonconforming sign may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby to the board of zoning adjustment. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the zoning administrator and with the board of zoning adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The board shall hear the appeal as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80, and as specifically empowered under Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-80(d)(1) and article 92 of this ordinance (Ordinance No. 63-93, as amended). Upon such appeal, the board shall consider any relevant factors, including those presented to the zoning administrator, and establish, according to its findings, the time during which said nonconforming sign shall be allowed to remain under the provisions of this ordinance. It shall not be necessary for the applicant to show any hardship or to qualify for a special exception under this ordinance to secure relief under this article. 
(7)  Any person or persons aggrieved by a decision of the board of adjustment may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court of Madison County, Alabama, as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-81, and by section 92.7 of this ordinance, as amended. 
72.7.3. A nonaccessory ground sign which is located between 500 and 1,000 feet from the nearest other such sign on or along the same side of the street or highway, or between 1,000 and 2,000 feet from the nearest other such sign on or along the same side of the street or highway in a highway business C-4 district and along interstate highways, which was prior to the adoption of this article a conforming sign in all other respects, is a permitted sign until it is removed or until said sign requires repairs or alterations of more than 50 percent of its then remaining economic value. 
72.7.4. A nonaccessory ground sign which is located nearer than 100 feet from any street intersection with another street, which sign was, prior to the adoption of this article, a conforming sign in all other respects, is a permitted sign until it is removed or until said sign requires repairs or alterations of more than 50 percent of its then remaining economic value. 
72.7.5. A ground sign which is mounted at least eight feet from ground level at the base of said sign and which does not exceed 35 feet in height above the adjacent ground and which was at the time of its construction in conformance with all the setback provisions of the zoning ordinance, is a permitted sign until it is removed or until said sign requires repairs or alterations of more than 50 percent of its then remaining economic value. 
72.7.6. A nonaccessory ground sign which is located within a 300-foot radius of any other nonaccessory ground sign, which sign was, prior to the adoption of this article, a conforming sign in all other respects, is a permitted sign until it is removed or until said sign requires repairs or alterations of more than 50 percent of its then remaining economic value. 
72.7.7. Signs permitted in sections 72.7.2, 72.7.3, 72.7.4, 72.7.5, and 72.7.6 are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts affected thereby. The intent of this article is that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for other uses prohibited in the same districts. 
72.7.8. If application of this ordinance requires compensation under the Federal Highway Beautification Act, now codified as 23 USC 131, as amended, with respect to the removal or downsizing of any sign, then such compensation, if required, shall be paid by the appropriate federal and state authorities as specified in the act. If, at the time conformity or removal is required under this section, federal and state funds are not available as provided under the Federal Highway Beautification Act, such nonconforming signs will be permitted to remain until compensation becomes available. 
If application of this ordinance does not require compensation under the Federal Highway Beautification Act, then at the time any sign is required to conform or be removed pursuant to this ordinance, such sign must be brought into conformity or removed without compensation.

72.13. - Severability. 
Should any section or provision of this ordinance be held void or invalid, it shall not affect the validity of any other section or provision thereof which is not of itself void or invalid, it being the purpose and intention of the city council to enact each separate section and/or subsection separately.

If such major street plan established a greater front yard requirement than contained in this ordinance, then such greater front yard requirement shall be required.  
73.5. - Rear dwelling prohibited. 
No dwelling shall be erected on a lot which does not abut on at least one street for at least 20 feet. 
No building in the rear of a main building on the same lot may be used for residential purposes.  
73.6. - Dual occupancy or uses. 
No building or structure may be used for residential purposes when said building or structure's primary purpose is used for office or other non-residential uses, except in a neighborhood business C-1 district when in compliance with section 20.1.1 (residential dwelling units); an office district; a planned development-housing district; a central business C-B district; or in a general business C-3 district.

73.11. - Curb cuts; driveways. 
All curb cuts or driveway entrances to major streets shall be constructed only after the city traffic engineer and the city engineer have ascertained that the proposed construction would not create a traffic hazard, would not create a drainage problem, and would not be detrimental to proposed improvements to said major street. Notwithstanding, any curb cut or driveway entrance shall meet all city engineering specifications.  
73.12. - Access. 
No structure shall be erected on a lot that does not abut on and have legal access to at least one street for the minimum frontage distance required by the zoning district; if no street frontage is specified, then the minimum street frontage shall be 20 feet. Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance, the planning commission shall have the discretion and authority to require that each use to which land is put in the City of Huntsville have sufficient means of access to serve the particular needs of the land affected prior to the approval by the planning commission or prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 96-259, § 1, 5-23-1996)  
73.13. - Multiple-family dwellings (apartment buildings). 
Plans for proposed multiple-family dwellings containing two or more buildings which are located on a parcel of land not subdivided into the customary streets and lots, or which contain a building not oriented so the main entrance(s) directly faces a street, shall be presented to the planning commission for review. The commission shall make certain the proposed development meets the following requirements: 
73.13.1. The proposed development shall be compatible with requirements and intent of the subdivision regulations relative to access, drainage, utilities, and major streets.

73.14.5 All vehicles that fail to comply with section 73.14.1 shall be removed by the owner or person responsible for same within 90 days after the effective date of this ordinance, and thereafter it shall be unlawful to maintain such vehicles on a residential lot except in conformity with this ordinance. 
73.14.6 No variances from section 73.14 shall be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 02-1005, § 1, 1-23-2003)  
73.15. - Front yards along major arterials. 
73.15.1 With the exception of the article 60, medical district regulations, minimum setback of 50 feet, of which the first ten feet for all non-residential uses shall be landscaped and maintained, shall be required along all major arterials, as defined in the major street plan, unless the applicable zoning regulations require a greater setback; provided however, that residential uses that do not derive their access from the major arterial shall be excluded from this provision. 
73.15.2 Exterior storage of materials shall be in the side and rear yards only and shall be contained and screened by fencing or landscaping in such a manner as to be neat in appearance when viewed from any street. No exterior display of products or merchandise is permitted in the required front yard except for sales of farm equipment, new and used cars, trailers, recreational vehicles, and mobile homes, and these uses shall not be permitted in the first ten feet of the required front yard. 
73.15.3 Off-street parking spaces are not permitted in the first ten feet of the required front yard as measured from the arterial right-of-way. Areas used for parking of motor vehicles shall be paved or surfaced with at least four inches of limestone.

73.15.6 The first ten feet of the required front yard shall be landscaped with at least an average of one tree and five shrubs per each 50 linear feet of frontage or portion thereof and the area shall be planted with a permanent evergreen ground cover. Shrubs are optional in areas where a berm at least three feet in height is used and the berm is planted with a permanent evergreen ground cover. Trees and shrubs shall be well distributed, though not necessarily evenly spaced. 
(1)  All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with section 73.19, installation of landscaping. 
(2)  All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat, healthy and growing condition; all unhealthy or dead plants shall be replaced by the next growing season with plants that conform to these regulations. 
73.15.7 Where these regulations conflict with other applicable zoning provisions, the more stringent shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 98-104, § 2, 3-26-1998; Ord. No. 18-900 , § 3, 11-15-2018)  
73.16. - The land use intensity (LUI) system; standards, definitions, methods of measurement, general requirements and limitations. 
In certain districts, and for specified uses in other districts, special forms of regulation based on the land use intensity (LUI) system and related controls apply. Standards relating to this system, definitions, methods of measurement, and general requirements and limitations are as follows: 
73.16.1. Definitions and methods of measurement relating to standard LUI ratios; requirements and limitations. The following definitions and methods of measurement shall be used in the districts and for the uses regulated under the LUI system. Except where application to other uses is specifically indicated, floor area, open space, livability space, and recreation space ratios shall be applied only to such land area, floor area, open space, and related elements as are allocated for residential uses and accessory uses incidental to and compatible with residential uses. 
(1)  Gross land area for PD districts. Gross land area of PD districts shall be computed as all land (except that to be devoted to nonresidential purposes) within district boundaries, plus one-half of adjoining permanent open space such as streets, parks, lakes, cemeteries, streams, and the like; provided width of adjoining open space credited shall not exceed in number of feet the numerical LUI rating for the district unless otherwise specified. Computations involving such open space shall be as provided for in section 3.1, lot, area for gross area of lots. 
Gross land area of PD districts shall not be construed to include lands not beneficial to residential use due to location or character, or areas used predominantly for commercial or other nonresidential purposes. 
As a further guide, where floor area of a building is predominantly in residential use, the building site shall be included in residential land area (as, for example, in the case of a multifamily structure with ten percent of its floor area in accessory commercial and service uses). 
(2)  Residential floor area defined; inclusions and exclusions; maximum limitation. Residential floor area is the sum of areas for residential use on all floors of buildings, measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls, including interior halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts, enclosed porches and private balconies, and belowgrade floor areas used for habitation and residential access. 
Not countable as residential floor area are: 
Open terraces, patios, atriums, or balconies; carports, garages, breezeways, tool sheds; exterior accessways serving more than one unit; special purpose areas for common use of occupants, such as recreation rooms or social halls; staff space for therapy or examination in care housing; basement space not used for living accommodations; or any commercial or other nonresidential space. 
Maximum residential floor area shall not exceed the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the floor area ratio (FAR) applying. 
(3)  Open space defined; inclusions and exclusions; minimum requirements. Open space is the total horizontal area of uncovered open space plus half the total horizontal area of covered open space subject to limitations set forth below: 
Uncovered open space is total gross land area not covered by buildings, plus open exterior balconies and roof area improved as recreation space. 
Covered open space is open space closed to the sky, suitable and designed for use as open space and/or livability or recreation space. Such space shall have not less than 20 percent of its perimeter open or partially open. "Partially open" is to be construed as having at least 50 percent open and unimpeded by visually opaque material. Examples of covered open space are covered balconies, covered portions of roof area, or spaces under buildings supported by posts, columns, or cantilevers. The square feet countable as covered open space shall not exceed the square footage of the open or partially open sides. 
Minimum open space required shall be not less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the open space ratio (OSR) applying. 
(4)  Livability space defined; inclusions and exclusions; minimum requirements. Livability space is space including lawns and other landscaped areas, walkways, paved terraces and sitting areas, outdoor recreation areas, and landscaped or sidewalk portions of street rights-of-way, appropriately improved and located for outdoor use by occupants and visitors, for safety and convenience, and for aesthetic appeal. Such space shall not be used by vehicles except for emergency actions. 
Minimum livability space required shall not be less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the livability space ratio (LSR) applying to the land use intensity. 
(5)  Recreation space defined; inclusions and exclusions; minimum requirements. Recreation space, part of total and livability open space, is exterior area appropriately improved for common recreational use. 
Active recreation space (swimming pools, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, tot lots, and the like) for common use shall be a minimum of 40 feet from any residential window at the same level, and this distance may be increased as required in particular circumstances. Both active and passive recreation space (with the latter consisting of walkways, sitting areas, and the like) for common use shall be so located, designed, screened, and buffered as to minimize potential adverse effects on privacy or tranquility of nearby residential units. In the case of active recreation space, character, hours of use, and lighting shall be considered in establishing any special conditions and safeguards. 
Recreation space may be located at ground level, or on suitably improved roof, terrace or balcony levels. 
Minimum recreation space required shall be not less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the recreation space ratio (RSR) applying. 
(6)  Car space defined; requirements. Occupant car space is garage, carport, or other off-street parking space, together with appropriate access and maneuvering ways, available to residents without time limits. 
Total car space is occupant car space plus other parking space available for unlimited or seldom limited time periods, primarily for guests. Where curb parking on streets is permissible, and likely to remain so, part or all of such other parking space requirements may be met by such curb parking. 
The occupant car ratio (OCR) and total car ratio (TCR) for the applicable land use intensity times the number of dwelling or lodging units equals the number of occupant and total parking spaces required, except in districts where lodging unit requirements are otherwise specified. 
73.16.2. Open space and building spacing. Yards, courts and other open spaces required herein in relation to structures or portions of structures are intended to perform a variety of functions. Among these (as appropriate to and required by the uses involved and their location) are ensuring adequate privacy; desirable outlook; natural light and ventilation; access to and around buildings; off-street parking and loading spaces and service areas; space for landscaping; spacing between buildings and portions of buildings for reducing potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or hazards from fire; and recreational space near buildings. 
These regulations, supplementing others set forth elsewhere in this ordinance, shall apply to yards, courts, other open spaces and building spacing in particular districts, or in relation to particular uses, as specified in regulations relating to such districts or uses. 
73.16.3. Rules concerning location and use of open space: 
(1)  Except in the case of fixed yards required adjacent to streets or lot lines, or as otherwise specified in regulations for particular districts, required yards and courts relating to residential uses controlled by these regulations need not be at ground level if, and to the extent that, in other locations their functions, nature, orientation, areas, access, and improvements are appropriate to uses within the buildings and adjoining buildings, and particularly to adjacent uses at the same level of the building and overviewing uses in the same or nearby buildings. 
(2)  Where lots or building sites adjoin permanent open space in parks, common open space, or other open space, excluding streets or drives, intended to remain so for perpetuity, half of the width of such open space shall be included in meeting building spacing requirements subject to the following limitations and exceptions: 
(a)  Where walls containing primary or secondary windows at or below the third story level face parking areas for ten or more cars, the full dimension of the required yard shall be provided and no such dimension shall include any portion of the parking area. Where such walls rise from decks of buildings, the third story level shall be construed to be the third story level above such decks. 
(b)  Where walls containing primary or secondary windows at or below the third story level face other permanent off-site open space which is likely to be of a nature adversely affecting privacy or tranquility of residential occupancy, then the full dimension of the required yard or open space shall be provided and no such dimension shall include any portion of such off-site open space. Where such walls rise from decks of buildings, the third story level shall be construed to be the third story above such decks. 
(3)  Where lots or building sites are located adjacent to public or private streets or private drives, then the full dimension of the required yard shall be provided from the back of the curb or pavement edge of a street, except for lots or buildings adjacent to a designated collector or major street in which case a minimum of 30 feet shall be required. 
(4)  Where two or more buildings containing living quarters are to be located on a single lot or tract, building sites pertaining to each shall be identified for determinations concerning compliance with spacing requirements. Open space shall be provided adjacent to lines of the building site as though they were lot lines. 
(5)  Spacing requirements for buildings or portions of buildings containing living quarters shall be based on horizontal length, number of stories, type of windows in walls involved, and orientation of main entrances to living quarters. Distance between walls shall be at least the sum of the depths of the open spaces required for each. 
(a)  Where portions of buildings contain different numbers of stories, required clearance from lot or building site lines shall be as established for the portion nearest to the lot line, except where spacing required for portions farther from the line is of greater depth, in which case the depth so established is the required clearance from the lot or site line (as projected vertically when space is provided other than at ground level). Lower portions of buildings may extend into clearance distances required for upper portions if roof areas are appropriately improved in relation to views from the same or higher levels by visual amenities such as landscaping, but such lower portions shall provide clearance to meet their own requirements. 
The drawing which follows illustrates these relationships. At the left of the building, the lot or building site line would be required to be at or beyond the point at which the diagonal at A reaches the ground, since the portion of the building to which it relates requires greater spacing than does B. To the right of the building, D requires greater spacing than does C, and would therefore determine the requirement. 
Permitted Overlap of Yards (vertical relationship)   
Vertical Relationship 
(b)  Length of walls shall be measured as the horizontal distance from corner to corner. Where walls in continuous general frontage area offset by setbacks equalling 30 percent or more of the height of the facade, the length of each segment so set off shall be measured separately in establishing pertinent yard or open space depth, provided that where open, partially open, or enclosed structures devoted to entrances, stair wells, and/or elevator shafts project from the general alignment of a wall, such structures shall not be construed as constituting a break-point in lengths involving building spacing determinations. 
Where walls in continuous general frontage enclose portions of buildings varying one story or more in height (as in the illustration above) length of each segment so varying shall be measured separately in computing pertinent yard depth. Length of a curved or irregularly shaped wall shall be construed as the shortest distance between the wall's end corners. Length of the wall of a circular building shall be construed as the diameter of the building. 
The drawing which follows illustrates the setbacks required when there is an offset in a wall equalling 30 percent or more of the height of the facade.   
Building Spacing Required 
(c)  Height in stories shall be computed as actual number of stories in the wall above ground level, with the following exceptions. Where the wall is along a slope, number of stories shall be construed as the arithmetic mean number, with half a story or more considered as a full story, and less than half a story ignored in computations. When height per story exceeds an average of 11 feet, calculations involved in yard or spacing determinations shall be based on an assumed number of stories derived by dividing building height by ten feet. 
Penthouses, roof shelters, and housing for mechanical equipment shall be ignored in computations involving number of stories except where they are visible from the ground level within 200 feet of the lot, are ten feet or more in height, and occupy 50 percent or more of the length of the wall at their bases, in which case an additional story shall be included in computations. On sloped sites, visibility shall be determined from the downhill side or from the sides at the same elevation only. 
(d)  Yard or other open space depth, between exterior building walls and adjacent lot or building site lines (projected vertically where appropriate), shall be measured horizontally in relation to the ground, and perpendicularly to straight walls or radially to curved walls. Distance at all points shall be at least equal to minimum requirements set forth herein, except as provided in section 3.1, court, and 3.1, yard, with regard to architectural and other projections. 
Yard space for two walls may overlap where it does not affect the distance between two buildings. 
The drawings which follow provide graphic explanation of permissible overlap and methods for measuring length of walls and depth of yards for a variety of building forms. 
  
Yard Depth, Building Length Illustrations 
(e)  For purposes of establishing open space requirements adjacent to walls enclosing living quarters, the following definitions and classifications shall govern: 
Habitable rooms are rooms designed and used for living, sleeping, eating, or cooking or combinations thereof. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, halls, storage rooms, laundry and utility spaces, basement recreation rooms, and similar areas are not considered habitable rooms. 
Primary windows are principal windows in habitable rooms except bedrooms and kitchens. 
Primary walls are walls containing primary windows and/or main exterior entrances to individual living quarters when directly facing the primary wall of other living quarters. 
Secondary windows are windows of habitable rooms other than primary windows, as defined above. 
Secondary walls are walls containing only secondary or secondary and tertiary windows. 
Tertiary windows are windows other than for habitable rooms. 
Tertiary walls are windowless walls, or walls containing only tertiary windows. 
Minimum distance from walls to lot lines or building site lines for buildings or portions of buildings containing living quarters shall be computed as follows, where D = depth in feet, L = length in feet, and S = height in stories: 
(i)  Primary walls: D = 6 + 2S + ;frax 
10; 
(ii)  Secondary walls: D = 2 + S + ;frax 
10; 
An example of building spacing requirements is shown in the following illustration:   
Building Spacing Requirements 
D1 equals 18 feet for a primary window wall 
 Six feet plus two feet for each floor of a three-story building plus 
 One foot for each ten feet of length (60 feet) 
 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 ft. 
D2 equals 7.6 ft. for a secondary window wall 
 Two feet plus one foot for each floor of a three-story building plus 
 One foot for each ten feet of length (26 feet) 
 2 + 3 + 2.6 = 7.6 ft. 
An illustration of building spacing requirements is shown in the following example, where 
Primary walls: D = 6 + 2S + ;frax 
10; 
Secondary walls: D = 2 + S + ;frax 
10; 
Tertiary walls: No setback required 
S = Number of Stories 
L = Length of Wall   
Building Spacing 
(f)  Special requirements and modifications concerning courts. 
(i)  Inner courts. 
1.  Inner courts are open outdoor spaces enclosed on all sides by building walls or potential building walls, [and] shall have a minimum dimension equal to the sum of the required yards but not less than ten feet. Their areas shall not be less than 100 square feet for one story or 150 square feet for two stories or more. 
2.  Unobstructed passageway. Except in the case of an inner court, atrium, or enclosed patio for a single dwelling unit, a passageway shall be provided at the lowest level of each inner court, as provided by the building code. Such passageway shall be continuous from the inner court to unobstructed open space adjacent to the building, and shall be so aligned as to facilitate passage of nonvehicular fire fighting and emergency equipment, including ladders. 
3.  Inner court design shall be such as to permit use of fire fighting equipment.

Offenders assigned to a custodial facility are generally allowed to leave the facility for off-site employment, job training, or other purposes as permitted by the operators of the facility and may be monitored in their activities by staff. A facility in this subclass may be but is not necessarily designed to be a secure facility.

Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. 
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited in the district involved.

Common ownership means owned by the same person or his affiliate. 
Contiguous lot means one or more lots which share a common boundary line.

Unified lot means two or more contiguous lots that are so integrated, through common or dependent structures or reliance on the other to meet setback requirements, as to form a unified whole. 
74.1.2 Nonconforming lots of record. Subject to section 74.1.3, a nonconforming lot of record may be used for a permitted use, except apartments and duplexes, nonetheless provided: 
(1)  The lot has a minimum width of 40 feet and a minimum area of 4,000 square feet, except as permitted in a Residence 2-C District; 
(2)  The lot abuts an all-weather street and has not less than 20 feet frontage; 
(3)  The proposed building conforms to all yard requirements for the district; and 
(4)  The water supply and sewage disposal meet all health requirements. 
Where two or more contiguous lots under common ownership are sufficient to create one lot of dimensions conforming to the requirements for the district in which the lots are located but the lots are not sufficient for the creation of two or more fully conforming lots, then all of the said lots shall be deemed merged into one lot.

ARTICLE 76. - BICYCLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS 
The requirements for bicycle parking are established for the purpose of ensuring provision of adequate and safe facilities to accommodate bicycle parking and to encourage use of bicycles for travel as an alternative to use of motorized vehicles. 
 
76.1. - Minimum parking space requirements. 
Bicycle parking facilities shall be provided for every new automobile parking lot or garage where 20 or more automobile parking spaces are required. Bicycle parking facilities shall also be provided for during the expansion of an existing automobile parking lot or garage where 20 or more automobile parking spaces are required when such expansion increases the required automobile parking by five percent or more. 
Unless otherwise expressly stated, bicycle parking spaces shall be provided for at a rate of one bicycle space for each 20 automobile parking spaces as automobile parking spaces are required under section 70.1 herein, with a minimum requirement of two bicycle parking spaces. Unless otherwise expressly stated, no automobile parking lot or garage shall be required to provide more than 30 bicycle parking spaces. 
No bicycle parking shall be required for residential uses other than multi-family residential developments. For multi-family residential uses, the bicycle parking requirement shall be one bicycle parking space for each five dwelling units and there is no maximum number of bicycle parking spaces. 
The total number of required automobile parking spaces shall be reduced at the ratio of one automobile parking space for each six bicycle spaces provided. The total number of required automobile parking spaces shall not be reduced by more than five percent for any automobile parking lot or garage. 
When the number of required automobile parking spaces for a new or expanded use is reduced by means of a zoning variance, the number of required bicycle spaces shall be calculated on the basis of the number of required automobile parking spaces, unless a variance is granted to reduce the number of required bicycle parking spaces. 
(Ord. No. 10-507, § 1, 8-26-2010)  
76.2. - Parking facility access and location requirements. 
Required bicycle parking spaces must have a minimum dimension of two feet in width by six feet in length with an access aisle of at least five feet and a vertical clearance of at least seven feet. A hard surfaced parking area is required for the bicycle racks. Bicycle racks must be securely anchored to the ground or the building structure to prevent the racks from being removed from the location. 
Bicycle racks must be installed with adequate space beside the parked bicycle so that a bicyclist will be able to reach and operate the locking mechanism. There must be a minimum of 24 inches beside each parked bicycle for access. This access may be shared by adjacent bicycles. However, each bicycle parking space must be accessible without moving another bicycle. 
Bicycle racks should be located so that parked bicycles do not block or impede the pedestrian path, handicapped access or vehicular circulation. Bicycle parking facilities located on sidewalks or other pedestrian accessways must leave clear pedestrian access of a minimum width of five feet. Bicycle parking facilities within automobile parking areas shall be separated by a physical barrier, such as a curb, wheel stop, pole, bollard or other similar feature, to protect bicycles from damage by automobiles. 
Areas set aside for bicycle parking shall have signs clearly posted and the bicycle parking spaces shall be reserved for bicycle parking only. 
Required bicycle parking spaces shall be located at least as close to the entrance of the building, facility or multi-family dwelling unit as the nearest nonhandicapped automobile parking space associated with said building, facility or multifamily dwelling unit. Where there are shopping centers or multi-tenant buildings with multiple entrances, the bicycle parking spaces must be well distributed and located as close to the entrances as the nearest non-handicapped automobile parking spaces. 
Where automobile parking is provided in an enclosed area, bicycle parking shall be provided within the enclosure or in such a way as to provide comparable protection from the elements. For any use where bicycle parking is required, if the automobile parking is covered or partly covered, the bicycle parking shall be covered at the same ratio. Bicycle parking facilities shall be located in highly visible and well-lighted areas to increase safety and to minimize theft and vandalism. 
(Ord. No. 10-507, § 1, 8-26-2010)  
76.3. - Bicycle rack and parking facility requirements. 
Bicycle racks shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  The bicycle rack must support the bicycle frame in two places and enable the frame and one or both wheels of the bicycle to be secured. The bicycle must be able to be securely held with its frame supported in an upright position so that the bicycle cannot be pushed or fall in manner that will damage the wheels or components of the bicycle. Bicycle racks that support the bicycle by the wheel only are not permitted. 
(b)  The bicycle rack must be able to accommodate high-security U-shaped bicycle locks. 
(c)  The bicycle rack shall have a durable finish that will protect the rack and the bicycle. 
(Ord. No. 10-507, § 1, 8-26-2010)  
CHAPTER VIII. - OFFICE DISTRICTS  
ARTICLE 80. - RESIDENTIAL OFFICE DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Purpose. The purpose of the residential office district is to provide for the conversion of existing blocks of dwellings to small offices as a means to stabilize the adjacent residential areas and prevent the intrusion of commercial uses. This district is intended to function as a transitional zone between existing residential and commercial by preserving the residential scale and intensity of use. The district allows the conversion of existing residences to office use and the development of vacant parcels with new office buildings designed to be compatible with existing adjacent residential dwellings. This district is intended for use in older developed areas. 
In order to preserve the residential scale, the district contains two density levels to ensure that residential-to-office conversions and new development closely approximate the scale of adjacent residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, this district is restricted to those locations that will not increase traffic through residential neighborhoods, and it imposes performance standards designed to prevent noise, lighting, parking and signs from intruding on or otherwise disrupting adjacent residential districts. 
The intent of this district is to provide space for small clerical offices that attract a limited clientele, usually on an appointment basis; if these operations later need to expand, it is intended that they should relocate rather than enlarge their operations beyond the limits set for this district. 
Within a residential office district as shown on the official Zoning Maps of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, the following regulations shall apply: 
(Ord. No. 98-260, § 1,5-14-1998) 
 
80.1. - Uses permitted. 
No building, structure, or land shall be used and no building or structure shall hereafter be erected, structurally altered, enlarged, or maintained except for one or more of the uses herein cited and subject to the conditions stated herein: 
Medical, optical, and dental offices and clinics for health professionals, excluding overnight care, ambulance services, and retail sales. 
Professional offices for lawyers, accountants, engineers and surveyors, architects, landscape architects, consultants, and similar professionals whose clientele normally visit on an appointment basis. 
Offices for consumer services such as real estate and insurance agencies and tax services. 
Administrative or general offices provided there are no retail or wholesale sales, no storage of products, no display of merchandise, and no storage of company vehicles or equipment. 
Child care homes and group child care homes in compliance with section 73.1.1(4), accessory uses, hereof. 
Single-family dwelling, provided that the requirements of section 11.2 (residence 1-A district) are met in a residential office 1 district and the requirements of section 13.2.1 (residence 2 district) are met in a residential office 2 district. 
Churches and similar places of worship. 
Agricultural uses as permitted in section 10.1 (residence 1 district). 
Accessory structures and uses only when necessary to the operation of the permitted use but not including retail sales. 
Government buildings and uses appropriate to the character of the district or requiring location within the district. 
Wireless telecommunications towers and antennas in compliance with the regulations required for location in residential districts. 
Prohibited principal and accessory activities include drive-in facilities, outdoor ATM or other vending machines, financial institutions, beauty[shops] and barbershops, and parking for off-site uses. 
Permitted uses as special exceptions as defined and regulated by subsection 92.5.3 hereof.

Any area to be rezoned residential office district shall: 
80.2.1. Have its frontage on and access from an arterial or collector street; or 
80.2.2. Have frontage on and access from a local street only if the local street connects directly to an arterial or collector street and there is no residential zoning along the local street between the major street and the proposed residential office district; or 
80.2.3. Be zoned residence 2-B district at the time of the request to rezone to residential office district. 
80.2.4. In addition to meeting at least one of the three preceding conditions, a proposed residential office district must also abut a residential district and at least one district that permits commercial or industrial activities. 
(Ord. No. 98-260, § 1, 5-14-1998)  
80.3. - Density controls for nonresidential uses. 
Because the intent of this district is to continue the size, scale and pattern of existing residential development, the density controls are designed to provide standards that will closely approximate the existing residential development. For this reason, two levels of density controls are provided based on the previous zoning district. For both levels, previous zoning district in the following table refers to the district designation prior to rezoning to residential office, or if not zoned residentially, then to the predominant adjoining residential district. 
DENSITY CONTROLS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL LOTS

B.  The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
C.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out;

E.  This section shall not apply to those sections of this ordinance that have their own provisions for waiver or modification of standards.

WHEREAS, Developer intends to subdivide and/or develop the Developer Property into lots or units for development, sale and/or lease (the "Subdivision/Development"); and

WHEREAS, Developer is desirous of establishing within the Subdivision/Development common areas for the common benefit, enjoyment and use of owners, occupants and guests of lands contained within the Subdivision/Development which common areas are designated on the Plat as "Common Area" and/or "Common Property" (the "Common Area"); and 
WHEREAS, to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, City is desirous of ensuring that the Common Area will be continually and properly maintained without expenditure of municipal funds so as to prevent burdening the general taxpayers with the cost of said maintenance. 
NOW, THEREFORE, FOR AND IN CONSIDERATION of (a) the premises which are deemed a material part of this Agreement and, by this reference, are incorporated herein, (b) the mutual agreements, covenants, provisions and terms of this Agreement set forth herein, (c) the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto, and (d) other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of all of which is hereby expressly acknowledged by City and Developer, and intending to be legally bound hereby, City and Developer agree and covenant with and unto each other, as follows: 
1.  Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
a.  City. This term shall mean and refer to the City of Huntsville, Alabama, and where necessary to perform the acts contemplated hereinafter shall include its officials, employees, contractors, and agents. 
b.  Private Owner. This term shall mean and refer to any person(s) and entity(ies) who are the grantee(s) in each deed or other conveyance recorded in the real estate records in the Office(s) of the Judge of Probate of the County(ies) in which the Subdivision/Development is located of the fee simple title to all or any portion of the real property embraced by the Plat, except for and excluding (i) a Public Owner and (ii) a Security Owner. This term "Private Owner" by definition shall include any owner of the Common Area including, but not limited to, an Association contemplated by Section 8. below. 
c.  Public Owner. This term shall mean and refer to any governmental entity owning any interest in any Public Areas. 
d.  Security Owner. This term shall mean and refer to any person or entity holding any interest in the Subdivision/Development solely as security for the performance or satisfaction of any obligation; provided, however, in the event a Security Owner succeeds to the right, title and interest of a Private Owner in and to any portion of the Subdivision/Development for any reason (whether by nonjudicial foreclosure, judicial foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) then, in that event, and from and after the date of acquisition of title, said Security Owner shall become a Private Owner as to such portion of the Subdivision/Development and thus subject to the duties, liabilities, obligations and responsibilities of a Private Owner under this Agreement. 
e.  Public Areas. This term shall mean and refer to any lands, including without limitation improvements situated thereon, within the Subdivision/Development dedicated to and accepted by the public such as public streets and rights-of-way (the "Public Areas"). 
f.  Private Owners' Lot/Unit. This term shall mean and refer to any lands within the Subdivision/Development owned by Developer or a Private Owner other than the Public Areas. 
2.  Maintenance of Common Area. Developer and each Private Owner shall be jointly and severally responsible for the continuous and proper maintenance of the Common Area, including without limitation Public Areas situated thereon, within the Subdivision/Development without expenditure of municipal funds (the "Maintenance Obligations"). Such Maintenance Obligations shall be in conformance with all applicable laws now existing or hereafter established, including without limitation City ordinances and codes governing nuisances; and conformance with same shall be as determined by the City. Such Maintenance Obligations include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Control of grass and weeds, removal of junk and litter, and pest and rodent control, but shall not include maintenance which is performed by the City in accordance with applicable ordinances governing maintenance of Public Areas ("General Maintenance"); 
b.  Maintenance of all public drainage features including, without limitation, public detention and/or retention ponds, culverts, drains and ditches and other public improvements, which maintenance shall include General Maintenance and control of water quality for algae, pond scum and any other such similar conditions ("Water Quality Control"), but shall not include maintenance which is performed by the City in accordance with applicable ordinances governing maintenance of public drainage easements ("Public Feature Maintenance"); 
c.

3.  Default in Maintenance Obligations. Upon the failure of Developer or a Private Owner to perform said Maintenance Obligations, and after any notice and opportunity to cure required by Section 7, hereof, the City shall have the right but not the obligation to perform, or have performed on its behalf, the Maintenance Obligations and shall have the right to receive joint and several full reimbursement from Developer and each Private Owner the costs of such Maintenance Obligations and the costs of collection of the same as set forth in Section 5, below. 
4.  Grant of Access. Developer, for itself and for each Private Owner, Public Owner and Security Owner, hereby grants City, and City's authorized agents, contractors, and employees, a continuous, permanent and irrevocable right of access across, along, over, under and through the Common Area and other unimproved portions of the Subdivision/Development to inspect the Common Area and, upon default by Developer and/or a Private Owner of the Maintenance Obligations, to perform the Maintenance Obligations whenever City deems necessary. 
5.  Recovery of Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs. In the event that City performs any Maintenance Obligations, City shall have the unconditional right to recover jointly and severally from Developer and/or any one or more or all of the Private Owners (a) the costs and expenses of all labor, equipment, fuel, materials, services, supplies and similar items used in such performance ("Maintenance Obligations Costs"), and (b) the sum of all costs, disbursements and expenses (including reasonable attorneys and engineering fees) incurred in collecting the same, together with all statutory pre- and post-judgment interest ("Collection Costs"). 
Each Private Owner, by the acceptance of a conveyance for such Private Owners' Lot/Unit, whether or not expressed in such conveyance, is hereby deemed to agree and covenant to pay to City the Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs. All such Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs shall be both (a) the personal obligation of the Private Owner at the time when the Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs are incurred by City and (b) a charge and lien on such Private Owners' Lot/Unit. 
The City shall be reimbursed for all Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs within twenty (20) days after City's written demand for the same. 
As security for the prompt and faithful payment of the Maintenance Obligations Costs and the Collection Costs, City shall have, and is hereby granted, a lien (the "City Lien") against both the Common Area and each Private Owners' Lot/Unit, which City Lien is and shall be paramount and prior to all liens on the Common Area and each Private Owners' Lot/Unit except for and subject to (a) the lien for current and future ad valorem taxes and (b) the lien of a construction or first mortgage held by an institutional or private lender. 
In the event Developer or any Private Owner shall fail to pay City the Maintenance Obligations Costs and the Collection Costs after said written demand for the same, City may pursue any one or more remedies for collection of the same (legal, equitable or otherwise) concurrently or consecutively (despite any defense of election of remedies or similar doctrines) including, but not limited to, a suit for money damages against Developer and/or one or more or all of Private Owners and/or enforcement of the City Lien against the Common Area and/or any one or more of the Private Owners' Lots/Units, whether by nonjudicial foreclosure, judicial foreclosure and/or otherwise. 
6.  Reimbursement of Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs. Any Private Owner (including Developer) who has paid to City any Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs shall have the unconditional right to recover jointly and severally from any other Private Owner (including Developer) the amount by which such paying Private Owner's payment to City exceeds his/her/its "Prorata Share". As used herein, the term "Prorata Share" means a fraction, (a) the numerator of which is one and (b) the denominator of which is the total number of Private Owners' Lots/Units within the Subdivision/Development excluding however the Common Area. 
For example, and for illustration purposes only, assuming (i) the total Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs incurred by City in one instance is $20,000.00, (ii) the total number of Private Owners' Lots within the Subdivision/Development are 50, and (iii) "Private Owner Smith" has paid City $1,000.00 for Maintenance Obligations Costs and Collection Costs, then "Private Owner Smith" may recover from one or more of the remaining Private Owners (including Developer) up to each other Private Owner's Prorata Share the aggregate sum of $600.00 calculated as follows: 
$1,000.00 - ($20,000.00 x 1) / (50) = $600.00 
A Private Owner's right of reimbursement from any one or more other Private Owners (including Developer) shall in no way defeat, impair, prevent or prohibit City's recovery of Maintenance Obligations Costs and/or Collection Costs from Developer and/or any Private Owner. 
7.  Notice and Cure. Except in the event of an immediate threat to the public health, safety, morals, general welfare or to public property in which event the City shall not be required to give Developer or any then-current Private Owner within the Subdivision/Development any notice or opportunity to cure, the City shall not perform the Maintenance Obligations on the Common Area until it has first given Developer or any then-current Private Owner within the Subdivision/Development notice of (a) the need to perform Maintenance Obligations on the Common Area and (b) thirty (30) days after the date of such notice within which to cure and perform the same. 
Such notice may be given in City's absolute and sole discretion and option in any one of the following ways: 
a.  By posting written notice upon the Common Area; or 
b.  By written notice given by (i) personal delivery, or (ii) overnight commercial courier, or (iii) facsimile transmission or (iv) United States First Class Certified Mail, postage prepaid, Return Receipt Requested, and addressed to the Developer or any then-current Private Owner within the Subdivision/Development, as appears from the then current records in the Office(s) of the Tax Assessor of the County(ies) in which the Subdivision/Development is located; or 
c.  By written notice left at the residence of the principal of the Developer or the residence of the authorized agent of the Association or the residence of any then-current Private Owner within the Subdivision/Development; or 
d.  Publication of ten (10) days written notice in a newspaper of general circulation published in the County(ies) in which the Subdivision/Development is located. 
8.  Association/Restrictions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or deemed as prohibiting the Developer and/or the Private Owners from (a) forming an owners, homeowners, condominium owners, business owners, or residence association (the "Association"), and/or (b) creating and establishing covenants, restrictions and/or restrictive covenants (the "Restrictions"), for the benefit, construction, governance, insurance, maintenance, operation, repair and/or regulation, of the Subdivision/Development and/or the Common Area. Such Association and/or Restrictions may, inter alia, establish and impose construction, governance, insurance, maintenance, operating, repair and/or regulatory obligations and responsibilities equal to or greater than those set forth in this Agreement, but shall not abrogate, impair, hinder, lessen or extinguish those imposed by this Agreement, nor shall they affect or supercede the City's rights and remedies under this Agreement. 
9.  Additional Areas. In the event that any portion(s) of the Subdivision/Development not now designated as Common Area on the Plat is/are hereafter dedicated, denominated and/or used as Common Area for the Subdivision/Development or any other real property, then such other portions shall be ipso facto included within the term "Common Area" and subjected to this Agreement. 
10.  Termination of Developer's Liability. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Developer's liability under this Agreement will terminate when Developer is no longer a Private Owner. 
11.  Remedies Cumulative. The City's rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies it might now or hereafter have under any federal, state or local law. 
12.  Authority and Power. Each party covenants, represents and warrants to each other party that it has complete and unrestricted authority, power and right to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement. 
13.  Recordation. This Agreement shall be recorded by City at Developer's prepaid expense in the real estate records in the Office of the Judge of Probate of each County in which the Property is located. 
14.  Covenants Running with the Land.

15.  No Liability. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it is expressly agreed, intended and understood that (a) neither City nor any Public Owner nor any Security Owner has any duty, liability, obligation and/or responsibility to maintain or repair the Common Area within the Subdivision/Development, (b) in no event shall this Agreement be construed to impose any such duty, liability, obligation and/or responsibility on the City and/or on any Public Owner and/or on any Security Owner, (c) the maintenance and repair of the Common Area within the Subdivision/Development is at all times the direct and sole duty, liability, obligation and responsibility of Developer and each Private Owner, and (d) neither the City nor the Public Owners nor their respective agents, employees and/or assigns, shall be liable to Developer and/or any Private Owner and/or any other person or entity for (i) the manner in which any of them exercise, or for the failure or refusal of any of them to exercise any authority or right granted to them herein, whether discretionary or not; (ii) the failure or refusal of Developer and/or any Private Owner to comply with any of the agreements, covenants, provisions and terms hereof; and/or (iii) the failure or refusal of City to enforce any one or more of the agreements, covenants, provisions and terms hereof against Developer and/or any Private Owner, and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and/or assigns.

The planning commission shall have final authority to designate street and subdivision names where conflicts exist with other established streets and subdivisions.  
4.2. - Blocks. 
(1)  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
A.  Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
B.  Zoning ordinance and/or health department requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
C.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; and 
D.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(2)  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width may be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, waterways, or in order to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(3)  Block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet. Wherever practicable, blocks along all arterial and major collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in length. 
(4)  Pedestrian walkways not less than five feet wide, all of which shall be constructed with concrete, shall be required across blocks where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities.

Concrete monuments placed on the boundary of the subdivision falling within the limits of a block will serve to satisfy the above requirement. 
(4)  All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes and rods at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter. These monuments shall be placed at all block corners and at each end of all angle points in any line. 
(5)  The lines of lots that extend to rivers, streams or major drainageways shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter or by round iron bars at least 18 inches long. These intersections shall be monumented by a witness corner established not less than 20 feet back from the bank of the river, stream, or major drainageway.  
4.5. - Roads. 
(1)  Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and conform to the construction standards of the City of Huntsville and shall be approved as to design standards by the city engineer, in accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat approval. In no case shall cut or fill embankments, except in the case of stable rock cuts, exceed a maximum slope of two feet horizontal to one foot vertical unless retained by a structural wall or other approved retaining method. 
(2)  Topography and arrangement. 
A.  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established by the major street plan. 
B.  All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
C.  Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. A grid system of street layout is discouraged. 
D.  Subdivisions which abut or have included within the proposed area to be subdivided any major collector or arterial street shall provide: 
(i)  A marginal access street with a minimum 15 feet wide nonaccess reservation adjacent thereto with screening berms and screen plantings which shall include trees, shrubs and ground covers between the marginal access street and major collector or arterial, or

(iii)  Deep lots with rear service drives, and a minimum 15 feet wide screen planting reservation along the front property line which shall include screening berms and screen plantings consisting of trees, shrubs and ground covers, or 
(iv)  Other treatment including screening fences or walls as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
E.  In business and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
(3)  Reserve strips. Unusable reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited. Land shall not be subdivided in a manner which omits part of the original tract to avoid drainage improvements. 
(4)  Dead end roads. 
A.  The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, coordinating the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts, effective access for emergency services including police, fire and ambulances, efficient provision of utilities, or where such continuation is in accordance with the major street plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead end street temporarily, the street and right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. 
B.  Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the planning commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the planning commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, and emergency medical services, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations. 
(5)  Design standards. 
A.  General design standards. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement, to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for roads are hereby required.

ARTICLE 5. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 
 
5.1. - Improvements and performance bond. 
(1)  Completion of improvements. Before the plat is signed by the chairman of the planning commission, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the planning commission's decision and to the specifications of the city engineer, all the street, sanitary, and other improvements including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary and final subdivision plats, and as approved by the planning commission. 
(2)  Bonds to insure performance. 
A.  The planning commission in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete all improvements prior to the signing of the subdivision plat, and provide that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond secured by an insurance company licensed by the State of Alabama, or a cash bond, or an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved lending institution, as approved by the legal department, at the time of application for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated by a registered professional engineer and approved by the city engineer, traffic engineer, and by the local utilities as sufficient to secure to the local government the satisfactory construction and installation of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. The bond or letter of credit shall also secure all lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these regulations. 
B.  Such bond or letter of credit shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the local government as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. A bare signature bond will not be accepted by the local government. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified by the planning commission in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond or letter of credit and shall not, in any event, be less than six months or more than two years from the date of final approval excepting sidewalk improvements which shall not be more than three years from the date of final approval. 
If the improvements are not completed within the period specified by the planning commission, the approval may be deemed to have expired, or, with the consent of the city council, the bond or the letter of credit shall be forfeited or invoked, as the case may be, to complete the improvements as provided by the final subdivision plat. 
C.  Sidewalk improvements may be secured by a bond or letter of credit for a period of one year after the initial three year bond or letter of credit has elapsed. Any such one year extension may only be made upon a finding by the City of Huntsville Inspection Division that no more than 75 percent of the total lots as shown on the recorded subdivision plat have been issued certificates of occupancy and a finding by the City of Huntsville Traffic Engineer that the delay in the completion of sidewalk improvements will not be detrimental to the public safety. Requests to the planning commission for further one year extensions of bonds or letters of credit insuring the completion of sidewalk improvements may be made, however each request must be accompanied by the above-mentioned findings from the Inspection Division and City of Huntsville Traffic Engineer. 
D.  Existing subdivisions that have received final plat approval of the planning commission prior to June 20, 1989 but have not yet had their public improvements accepted for dedication by the local government may offer such improvements for dedication when all required public improvements, with the exception of sidewalks, have been completed and constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications as stated in the subdivision regulations. In such cases, the public improvements may be accepted for public dedication on the condition that the applicant post a bond or letter of credit that complies with all statutory requirements and is satisfactory to the local government as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution as set forth in this regulation and is in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of constructing the unbuilt portions of sidewalks. The maximum duration of said bond or letter of credit shall be two years from the effective date of said bond or letter of credit. An additional one year bond or letter of credit may be posted to secure sidewalk improvements after the initial two year bond or letter of credit has elapsed upon a finding by the city inspection division that no more than 50 percent of the total lots, as shown on the recorded subdivision plat, have been issued certificates of occupancy and a finding by the City of Huntsville Traffic Engineer that the delay in the completion of the sidewalk improvements will not be detrimental to public safety. Requests for further one year extension of bonds or letters of credit insuring the completing of sidewalk improvements may be requested, however, each request must be accompanied by the above-mentioned findings from the City Inspection Division and City of Huntsville Traffic Engineer. 
(3)  Cost of improvements. Unless otherwise specified, all required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the local government or any improvement district herein. 
(4)  Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be in accordance with the procedure established by the local government. The approval by the planning commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the local government of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The planning commission may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect.  
5.2. - Inspection of improvements. 
(1)  General procedure. The city engineer shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and insure their satisfactory completion. If the city engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications as outlined in these regulations, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a bond or letter of credit, the applicant and the bonding company or institution shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. 
(2)  Certificate of satisfactory completion for subdivisions with public improvements. The applicant shall state in writing to the city engineer that to the best of his knowledge the public improvements have been completed as required. The applicant's engineer and his surveyor shall certify to the city engineer, through the submission of a letter of acceptance and detailed "as-built" engineering drawings of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the planning commission or city engineer, that all public improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans and with City of Huntsville specifications and that the improvements have been completed, are located within the dedicated and platted easements and/or rights-of-way, and are ready for dedication to the local government. For subdivisions where construction occurred on lands or portions of lands which are designated as hazard zone as defined by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, the following certifications shall be affixed to the letter of acceptance and the "as-built" engineering drawings of the subdivision: 
ENGINEER OF RECORD

Upon such approval and recommendation of the city engineer, the local government may thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. 
However, the local government may accept for dedication a subdivision in which the required sidewalks are incomplete on the condition that the construction and installation of such sidewalks are secured by a bond or letter of credit as defined in section 5.1(2)A. and further provided that such bond or letter of credit guarantees completion of said sidewalks within three years of the date of final plat approval. 
(3)  Certificate of satisfactory completion for private subdivisions. The applicant shall state in writing to the city engineer that to the best of his knowledge the improvements have been completed as required. The applicant's engineer and his surveyor shall certify to the city engineer, through the submission of a letter of completion and detailed "as-built" engineering drawings of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the planning commission or city engineer, that all improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved construction plans and with City of Huntsville specifications and that the improvements have been completed and are located within the platted easements and/or rights-of-way. For subdivisions where construction occurred on lands or portions of lands which are designated as Hazard Zone as defined by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Huntsville, Alabama, the engineer of record and owner certifications shall be affixed to the letter of completion and the "as-built" engineering drawings of the subdivision as exemplified in section 5.2(2) of these regulations: 
The local government may approve a letter of completion for a subdivision in which the required sidewalks are incomplete on the condition that the construction and installation of such sidewalks are secured by a bond or letter of credit as defined in section 5.1(2)A. and further provided that such bond or letter of credit guarantees completion of said sidewalks within three years of the date of final plat approval. 
(4)  Certificate of completion for subdivisions with public and private improvements. For subdivisions with both public and private infrastructure improvements a certificate of satisfactory completion will be required for the public improvements following the procedure as stated in [section] 5.2(2) and a certificate of satisfactory completion will be required for the private improvements following the procedure stated in [section] 5.2(3). 
(5)  Reduction or release of bonds. The bond or letter of credit covering all public improvements may be reduced upon acceptance of all public improvements by the City of Huntsville. The bond or letter of credit covering all private improvements may be reduced upon approval of the letter of satisfactory completion by the City of Huntsville. The city engineer shall set the amount of the bond or letter of credit to be retained by the city for a period of at least 12 months following the date of acceptance of public improvements and/or approval of letter of satisfactory completion for private improvements. The bond or letter of credit shall be released only upon receipt by the city engineer of a letter from the applicant's registered professional engineer stating that any improvements required by the City of Huntsville since the date of acceptance of public improvements and/or approval of letter of satisfactory completion for private improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans and City of Huntsville specifications and are located within the dedicated and/or platted easements and/or rights-of-way. At such time, the city engineer shall recommend in writing to the city clerk-treasurer that the bond or letter of credit be reduced or released. The city engineer shall recommend the amount of the bond or letter of credit to be held as deemed necessary to insure that the improvements are completed and/or repaired or replaced and made acceptable to the City of Huntsville. 
A bond or letter of credit covering sidewalk improvements, if posted, shall be released upon receipt by the city engineer of a letter from the applicant's registered professional engineer and land surveyor stating that the sidewalk improvements have been completed and have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans and City of Huntsville specifications and are located within the dedicated and/or platted easements and/or rights-of-way. At such time, the city engineer shall recommend in writing to the city clerk-treasurer that the bond or letter of credit be released if, in his opinion, the sidewalks have been satisfactorily completed. 
(6)  Forfeiture of bonds. If, during the period when the subdivision improvements are covered by a bond or letter of credit, the construction of said subdivision creates a situation that is harmful, dangerous or an unreasonable nuisance to an adjacent property owner and the applicant does not correct the situation in a timely fashion, or if the applicant responsible for constructing the subdivision improvements goes into receivership or is otherwise financially unable to complete said improvements, or if said applicant abandons or leaves said subdivision improvements uncompleted, then the city council may, at the recommendation of the planning commission, invoke said bond or letter of credit and direct that such work be completed so as to eliminate any dangerous, harmful, or unreasonable nuisance.  
5.3. - Deferral of required improvements. 
The construction of specific required improvements may be deferred if the planning commission finds that: 
(1)  The improvement is likely to be destroyed while still in a good state of repair due to the planned upgrading or expansion of public facilities or to expected future private development adjacent to the site; 
(2)  The improvement would be so situated that it would be likely to deteriorate before it was put into service because it could not presently be used for its intended purpose; 
(3)  The improvement would require additional off-site easements or rights-of-way in order to be constructed to city standards; 
(4)  The improvement, if constructed concurrently with the subdivision, could create a situation hazardous to the health and/or safety of the public because of the nature of adjoining public or private features; or 
(5)  The city engineer or traffic engineer recommends that such improvement be deferred due to a unique characteristic or situation that would have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the improvement if it were constructed. 
If the planning commission so finds, then the applicant shall pay to the local government prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat a sum of money equal to the cost of constructing the deferred improvement as estimated by a registered professional engineer and approved by the city engineer.
