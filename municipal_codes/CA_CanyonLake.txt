The City Council finds that it is desirable and in
the public interest to establish a municipal code in
order to provide a scheme of organization for the
classification and grouping of ordinances which the
Council may adopt. The Council intends in adopting
ordinances of a general and permanent nature to
provide for their placement in accordance with the
scheme of the code. This will provide the user with
a convenient and logical compilation of the ordinances
of the City.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.001)
1.01.002 Establishment of Municipal Code.
This code shall be known as the “City of Canyon
Lake Municipal Code.” It shall be sufficient to refer
to this Code as the City of Canyon Lake Municipal
Code in any prosecution for the violation of any
provision of this Code. It shall also be sufficient to
designate any ordinance adding to, amending,
correcting, or repealing provisions of this Code as an
addition or amendment to, or a repeal of, the City of
Canyon Lake Municipal Code, or a portion thereof.

All the provisions of this Code and all other City
ordinances shall be interpreted to refer to the
appropriate or designated officer or office of the City,
and whether an ordinance, uniform code, statute, or
other matter which is adopted by reference refers to
any department, officer, employee, inspection, police,
or other function, unless the context requires
otherwise, all references shall be to the appropriate or
designated office, officer, department, agency,
employee, or function of the City, or to the person or
agency performing the function for the City.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.010)
1.01.020 Effect of Code on past actions and
obligations.
Neither the adoption of this Code nor the repeal
or amendment by this Code of any ordinance or part
or portion of any ordinance previously in effect in the
City or within the territory currently comprising the
City, shall in any manner affect the prosecution for
the violation of any ordinance, which violation was
committed prior to the effective date of this Code, nor
be construed as a waiver of any license, fee or penalty
on such effective date due and unpaid under such
ordinances, nor be construed as affecting any of the
provisions of such ordinances relating to the collection
of any such license, fee or penalty or the penal
provisions applicable to any violation of such
ordinances, nor to affect the validity of any bond or
cash deposit required to be posted, filed, or deposited
pursuant to any ordinance, and all vested rights and
obligations pertaining to such ordinances shall
continue in full force and effect. The repeal of an
ordinance shall not repeal the repealing clause of such
ordinance or revive any ordinance which has been
repealed thereby.

1.01.030 Partial invalidity.
If any chapter, section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase or portion of this Code is for any
reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision
and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions thereof. The City Council hereby
declares that it would have passed this Code, and each
section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase
thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more
sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases
had been declared invalid or unconstitutional; and if
for any reason the Code should be declared invalid or
unconstitutional, then the original ordinance or
ordinances shall be in full force and effect.

virtue of the Constitution, or any law, or by reason of
ownership or control of property.
(3-12/90 § 1.01.040)
1.01.050 Local signification.
All references in this Code to places, acts,
persons or things and all else in relation to this Code
shall be construed to mean that the same are
applicable to this City, whether the City is mentioned
in each particular section or not. Portions of this Code
have been adopted from or relate to the same subject
as is set forth in the Riverside County Code. To the
extent that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or
phrase of this Code is in conflict with the Riverside
County Code provisions so adopted, the later-adopted

nuisance or violation was abated, but such person
subsequently allowed or was responsible for a
recurrence of the nuisance or violation.
(d) The liability of any person for the payment
of the costs and expenses, provided for in Subsection
(a) of this Section may be waived in whole or in part
in an amount not to exceed $100, by the City Attorney
in any case wherein he determines, in his sole
discretion, that the failure or refusal of such person to
comply with the notice therein involved was based
upon a good faith and bona fide issue of law or fact
specially involved in the circumstances of the case.
Any determination or decision of the City Attorney in
this regard shall be final and conclusive.
(e) Moneys due to the City pursuant to this
Section may be recovered in an appropriate civil
action. Alternatively, such liability may be enforced
by special assessment proceedings against the parcel
of land upon which the nuisance existed, which
proceedings may be conducted in a manner
substantively similar to proceedings described in
Sections 39574 et seq. of the Government Code of the
State relating to weed abatement assessments.

familiar with these issues;
(c) Residents prefer that the Canyon Lake Fire
Station remain open with some level of service;
(d) The City of Canyon Lake wishes to maintain
services the community has identified as priorities,

local needs—the funds generated by the Temporary
Canyon Lake 911 Emergency Response, Local
Control/Fiscal Accountability Measure cannot be
seized by Sacramento politicians and can be only spent
on our community's needs; and
(f) The proposed utility user tax will include
published independent annual audits, no tax increase
without voter approval, and expires in six years unless
extended by voters.

a tax upon any person or service when the imposition
of such tax upon such person or service would be in
violation of a Federal or State statute, the Constitution
of the United States or the Constitution of the State of

under this subsection shall comply with the notification
requirements of subsection (k) of this section if any
change in fact or circumstance disqualifies the
individual from receiving this exemption.
(b) The City. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as imposing a tax upon the City.
(c) Exemption application. Any service user that
is exempt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section
from any tax imposed by this chapter shall file an
application with the Tax Administrator for an
exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall
not apply to a service user that is a State or Federal
agency. Said application shall be made upon a form
approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state
those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which
qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall
include the names of all service suppliers serving that
service user.
(d) Application processing. The application shall
be approved or denied by the Tax Administrator within
75 days of receipt.
ALP S-7

(e) Notice to service supplier. If the application
is approved, the Tax Administrator shall promptly
notify the service user's service suppliers stating the
name of the service user, the address to which such
exempt service is being supplied, the account number,
if any, and such other information as may be necessary
for the service supplier to remove the exempt service
user from its tax billing procedure.

notice of service user exemption, the service supplier
shall within 60 days discontinue billing the service user
for taxes imposed by this chapter.

automatically terminate with any change in service
address or residence of the exempt individual. The
individual may apply for a new exemption with each
change of service address or residence. The Tax
Administrator shall have the power and right to demand
evidence of continued eligibility. Failure to provide
such evidence as is within the control of a service user
to provide may be the basis for immediate
discontinuance of the service user's eligibility for
exemption under this section.
(h) Denial–Appeal. If the Tax Administrator
determines that an application for exemption is faulty,
that the applicant has failed to truthfully set forth facts,

under this section shall notify the City within ten days
of any change in facts or circumstance that might
disqualify the person from receiving such exemption.
Any service supplier that determines by any means that
a new or nonexempt service user is receiving service
through a meter or connection exempt by virtue of an
exemption issued to a previous user or exempt user of
the same meter or connection, shall immediately notify
the Tax Administrator of such fact and the Tax

ascertain whether or not the provisions of this section
have been complied with, and when appropriate, order

(a) Establishment of telecommunications users'
tax. There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person
in the City using telecommunication services. The tax
imposed by this section shall be at the rate of 3.95% of
the charges made for such services and shall be
collected from the service user by the
telecommunication services supplier or its billing
agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that
telecommunication services, which are billed to a
billing or service address in the City, are used, in whole
or in part, within the City's boundaries, and such
services are subject to taxation under this chapter. If the
billing address of the service user is different from the
service address, the service address of the service user
shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As used
in this section, the term “charges” shall include the
value of any other services, credits, property of every
kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the
service user in exchange for the telecommunication
services.
(b) Substantial nexus and minimum contacts. For
purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to
ALP S-7
Utility Users’ Tax 24G
collect and remit a tax under this section, “substantial
nexus” and “minimum contacts” shall be construed
broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or

are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of other
telecommunication services, including but not limited
to post-paid telecommunication services, prepaid
telecommunication services, and private telecommunication
services, provided that such rules are
based upon custom and common practice that further
administrative efficiency and minimize multijurisdictional
taxation.
(d) Authority for administrative rulings. The Tax
Administrator may, from time to time, issue and
disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers that
are subject to the tax collection requirements of this
section an administrative ruling identifying those
communication services that are subject to the tax of
subsection (a) above. This administrative ruling shall
be consistent with legal nexus rules, regulations, and
laws pertaining to telecommunication services. To the
extent that the Tax Administrator determines that the
tax imposed under this section shall not be collected in
full for any period of time, such a determination falls
within the Tax Administrator's discretion to settle
disputes. The Tax Administrator's exercise of
forbearance under this subsection does not constitute a
change in taxing methodology for purposes of
Government Code Section 53750, and the City does not
waive or abrogate its ability to impose the
telecommunication users' tax in full.
(e) Specific inclusions in telecommunication
services. As used in this section, the term

services,” such as music, ringtones, games, and similar
digital products. Telecommunication services shall not
include telecommunication services that are dedicated
to or used exclusively for internet access.

for services or facilities furnished to the government of
any state, or any political subdivision thereof, or the
District of Columbia.
(2) Installation. The installation of any
instrument, wire, pole, switchboard, apparatus or
equipment as is properly attributable to such

services subject to tax under this
section, any service user, upon proof to the Tax
Administrator that the service user has previously paid
the same tax in another state or local jurisdiction on
such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the
amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state
or local jurisdiction; provided, however, the amount of
credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the City under
this section.

identifying those components: (1) that are necessary or
common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of video
services; or (2) which currently are, or historically have
been, included in a bundled rate for video service by a

user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of
the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing
period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the
tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases
where a service user has notified the service supplier of
refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section
3.26.160 shall apply.
(2) The duty of a service supplier to collect
the tax from a service user shall commence with the
beginning of the first regular billing period applicable
to the service user where all charges normally included
in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of
this chapter. Where a service user receives more than
one billing, one or more being for different periods
than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately
for each billing period.
(b) Filing return and payment. Each person
required by this chapter to remit a tax shall file a return
to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by the
Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full
amount of the tax collected shall be included with the
return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator is authorized to require such additional
information as he or she deems necessary to determine
if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in
accordance with this chapter. Returns are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.
Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the
Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such
filing returns as confidential information that is exempt
from the disclosure provisions of the Public Records
Act.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.130 Collection penalties–Service suppliers.
(a) Due date for taxes—Delinquencies. Taxes
collected from a service user are delinquent if not
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due
date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal
holiday, the return must be received by the Tax
Administrator on the first regular working day
following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct
deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other
similar methods of electronically exchanging monies
between financial accounts, made by a service supplier
in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection
shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on
or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the
City's account on the following business day.
(b) Failure to collect or remit. If the person
required to collect and/or remit a tax imposed pursuant
to this chapter fails to collect the tax (by failing to
properly assess the tax on one or more services or
charges on the customer's billing) or fails to remit the
tax collected on or before the due date, the Tax
Administrator shall attach a penalty for such
delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of 15% of the
total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the
remittance, and shall charge simple interest at the rate
of 9% per year, or any fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent, until
paid.
(c) Penalties for fraud or gross negligence in
reporting or remitting. The Tax Administrator shall
have the power to impose additional penalties upon
persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross
negligence in reporting or remitting at the additional
rate of 15% of the amount of the tax collected and/or
required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax
Administrator.
(d) Penalties due as tax. For collection purposes
only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is
accrued under the provisions of this section shall
become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.
ALP S-7
Utility Users’ Tax 24O
(e) Authority to modify due dates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator
may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of
this chapter to be consistent with any uniform standards
or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other
public agencies imposing a utility user's tax, or
otherwise legally established, to create a central
payment location or mechanism.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.140 Actions to collect.
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under
the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt
owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax
collected from a service user which has not been
remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a
debt owed to the City by the person required to collect
and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service
user. Any person owing money to the City under the
provisions of this chapter shall be liable in an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such
amount, including penalties and interest as provided for
in this chapter, along with any collection costs incurred
by the City as a result of the person's noncompliance
with this chapter, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees. Any tax required to be
collected by a service supplier or owed by a service
user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation
under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C).
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.150 Deficiency determination and
assessment–Tax application errors.
(a) Tax deficiency determinations. The Tax
Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if
he or she determines that any service user or service
supplier required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter has failed to pay, collect,
and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly
applying or by failing to apply the tax to one or more
taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall
require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings
under this section if, in the opinion of the Tax
Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement
likely outweighs the tax benefit.
(b) Notice of deficiency. The Tax Administrator
shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to
the person or entity allegedly owing the tax, which
notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes
owed, plus simple interest at the rate of 9% per year, or
any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the
date on which the tax should have been received by the
City. Within 14 days after the date of service of such
notice, the person or entity allegedly owing the tax may
request in writing to the Tax Administrator a hearing
on the matter.
(c) Hearing on deficiency. If the person or entity
allegedly owing the tax fails to request a hearing within
the prescribed time period, the amount of the
deficiency determination shall become a final
assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to
the City. If such person or entity requests a hearing, the
Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for
hearing, which shall be scheduled within 30 days after
receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the
Tax Administrator to such person at least ten days prior
to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires
said person to produce specific records at such hearing,
such notice may designate the records requested to be
produced.
(d) Determination after hearing. At the time
fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear
all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of
any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax
Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time
to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of
additional evidence. Within a reasonable time
following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax
Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or
non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying
or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and
shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person or
entity owing the tax. The decision of the Tax
Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section
3.26.200 and such an appeal and a final decision
thereon is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.
(e) Delinquencies. Payment of the final
assessment shall become delinquent if not received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day
following the date of receipt of the notice of final
ALP S-7
24P Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be 15%
on the total amount of the assessment, along with
simple interest at the rate of 9% per year, or any
fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The
applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by
the City seeking payment of a tax assessed under this
chapter shall commence from the date of delinquency
as provided in this subsection.
(f) Notice of delinquency. All notices under this
section may be sent by regular mail, first class, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third
calendar day following the date of mailing, as
established by a proof of mailing.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.160 Administrative remedy–Non-paying service
users.
(a) Administrative remedies for the obligation to
collect tax. Whenever the Tax Administrator
determines that a service user has deliberately withheld
the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the
amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax,
or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best
interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person
of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this
chapter from certain named service users for specific
billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed
to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or
more billing periods, the service supplier may be so
relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The
service supplier shall provide the City with the names
and addresses of such service users and the amounts of
taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter.
Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator
institute proceedings under this section if, in the
opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection
or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.
(b) Delinquency penalty. In addition to the tax
owed, the service user shall pay all penalties and
interest due under Section 3.26.130(b) as well as the
delinquency penalty set out in Section 3.26.130(c), on
the amount of the tax, from the due date, until paid, as
well as any and all costs of collection.
(c) Notice to non-paying service user. The Tax
Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user
that the Tax Administrator has assumed the
responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated
periods and demand payment of such taxes, including
penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the
service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the
notice in the United States mail, first class, postage
prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to
which billing was made by the person required to
collect the tax; should the service user have a change of
address, notice shall be sent to his or her last known
address.
(d) Additional penalties. If the service user fails
to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within 30
days from the date of the service of the notice upon him
or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional
penalty of 15% of the amount of the total tax that is
owed.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.170 Additional powers and duties of the Tax
Administrator.
(a) Enforcement by Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is
hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the
provisions of this chapter.
(b) Administrative regulations regarding
payment. The Tax Administrator may adopt
administrative rules and regulations consistent with
provisions of this chapter for the purpose of
interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein
imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a
new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in
this section, or increase an existing tax, except as
allowed by California Government Code Section
53750. A copy of such administrative rules and
regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's
office. To the extent that the Tax Administrator
determines that the tax imposed under this chapter shall
not be collected in full for any period of time from any
particular service supplier or service user, that
determination shall be considered an exercise of the
ALP S-7
Utility Users’ Tax 24Q
Tax Administrator's discretion to settle disputes and
shall not constitute a change in taxing methodology for
purposes of Government Code Section 53750 or
otherwise. The Tax Administrator is not authorized to
amend the City's methodology for purposes of
Government Code Section 53750 and the City does not
waive or abrogate its ability to impose any tax
established by this chapter in full as a result of
promulgating administrative rulings or entering into
agreements.
(c) Administrative agreements regarding billing
procedures. Upon a proper showing of good cause, the
Tax Administrator may make administrative
agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from
the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby: (1)
conform to the billing procedures of a particular service
supplier so long as said agreements result in the
collection of the tax in conformance with the general
purpose and scope of this chapter; or (2) to avoid a
hardship where the administrative costs of collection
and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy
of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax
Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax
Administrator or the City Council at any time.
(d) Compliance audits. The Tax Administrator
may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance
with the requirements of this chapter, of any person
required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this
chapter. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person
of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of
fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period
of review shall not exceed a period of three years next
preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by
said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon
completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may
make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section
3.26.150(a) for all taxes (and applicable penalties and
interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by
information provided by such person to the Tax
Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to
provide sufficient records to enable the Tax
Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a
reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable
estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
correctness.
(e) Extension of time. Upon receipt of a written
request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax
Administrator may extend the time for filing any
statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period
of not to exceed 45 days, provided that the time for
filing the required statement has not already passed
when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent
payment shall accrue by reason of such extension.
Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of
9% per year, prorated for any portion thereof.
(f) Eligibility for exemption. The Tax
Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any
person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a
refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter.
(g) Waiver of penalties and interest.
Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the
contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty
or interest imposed upon a person required to collect
and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by
this chapter if the non-collection occurred in good faith.
In determining whether the non-collection was in good
faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into
consideration industry practice or other precedence.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.180 Records.
(a) Retention of necessary tax records. It shall
be the duty of every person required to collect and/or
remit to the City any tax imposed by this chapter to
keep and preserve, for a period of at least three years,
all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as he/she may have been liable for
the collection of and remittance to the Tax
Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator
shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.
(b) Administrative subpoenas. The City may
issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to
deliver to the Tax Administrator copies of all records
deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to
establish compliance with this chapter, including the
delivery of records in a common electronic format on
readily available media if such records are kept
electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary
ALP S-7
24R Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
course of business. As an alternative to delivering the
subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or
before the due date provided in the administrative
subpoena, such person may provide access to such
records outside the City on or before the due date,
provided that such person shall reimburse the City for
all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the City to
inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals,
and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal
salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by
the City to conduct the inspection.
(c) Non-disclosure agreements. The Tax
Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure
agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the
confidentiality of customer information pursuant to
California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and
7284.7.
(d) Use of billing agents. If a service supplier
uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect,
and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1)
provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and
telephone number of each billing agent and billing
aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier
to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the City; and (2)
upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or
effect the delivery of, any information or records in the
possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator
that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is
necessary to verify the proper application, calculation,
collection and/or remittance of such tax to the City.
(e) Access to necessary records. If any person
subject to record-keeping under this section
unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator access to
such records, or fails to produce the information
requested in an administrative subpoena within the time
specified, then the Tax Administrator may impose a
penalty of $500 on such person for each day following:
(1) the initial date that the person refuses to provide
such access; or (2) the due date for production of
records as set forth in the administrative subpoena.
This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty
imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.190 Refunds.
Whenever the amount of any tax has been
overpaid or paid more than once or has been
erroneously or illegally collected or received by the
Tax Administrator under this chapter from a person or
service supplier, it may be refunded as provided in this
section as follows:
(a) Refund application. Any individual entitled
to be exempt from the taxes imposed by this chapter,
who paid more than $3 in such taxes, may, during the
12-month period following such payment, apply for a
refund thereof on forms provided by the Tax
Administrator. Refund applications shall contain a
declaration of those facts, under oath, which qualify the
applicant for a refund, and shall be accompanied by the
customer's bills showing the amount of such taxes
billed by the service supplier during the preceding
calendar year. Refund claims may be filed by an
individual who used the services and paid the taxes
prescribed by this chapter either directly or indirectly
to the service user rather than the service supplier. In
the event the applicant has lost or destroyed any
relevant billings or statements showing the amount of
tax paid, or if the applicant indirectly paid such taxes in
conjunction with the occupation of premises without
receiving a specific billing therefor from the service
user, the maximum refund shall be $25, or $2 for each
full month of services received by the applicant,
whichever is less.
(b) Written claim for refund. No refund shall be
paid under the provisions of this section unless the
claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor,
or administrator has submitted a written claim to the
Tax Administrator within one year of the overpayment
or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. To be
timely, such claim must clearly establish claimant's
right to the refund by written records showing
entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the
filing of a claim on behalf of a class or group of
taxpayers unless each member of the class has
submitted a written claim under penalty of perjury as
provided by this subsection or as otherwise allowed by
law.
ALP S-7
Utility Users’ Tax 24S
(c) Compliance with claims act. The filing of a
written claim pursuant to Government Code Section
935 is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action
brought against the City pursuant to this section shall
be subject to the provisions of Government Code
Sections 945.6 and 946. The City Manager or City
Council shall act upon the refund claim within the time
period set forth in Government Code Sections 912.4 et
seq. If the City Manager or City Council fails or refuses
to act on a refund claim within the time prescribed by
Government Section 912.4, the claim shall be deemed
to have been rejected by the City Council on the last
day of the period within which the City Council was
required to act upon the claim as provided in
Government Code Section 912.4. The Tax
Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form
which substantially complies with that set forth in
Government Code Section 913.
(d) Refunds to service suppliers. The Tax
Administrator may, at his or her discretion, give written
permission to a service supplier, who has collected and
remitted any amount of tax in excess of the amount of
tax imposed by this chapter, to claim credit for such
overpayment against the amount of tax which is due the
City upon a subsequent monthly return to the Tax
Administrator, provided that: (1) such credit is claimed
in a return dated no later than one year from the date of
overpayment or erroneous collection of said tax; (2) the
Tax Administrator is satisfied that the underlying basis
and amount of such credit has been reasonably
established; and (3) in the case of an overpayment by a
service user to the service supplier that has been
remitted to the City, the Tax Administrator has
received proof, to his or her satisfaction, that the
overpayment has been refunded by the service supplier
to the service user in an amount equal to the requested
credit.
(e) Overpayments as credits. Notwithstanding
subsections (a) through (c) above, a service supplier
shall be entitled to take any overpayment as a credit
against an underpayment whenever such overpayment
has been received by the City within the three years
next preceding a deficiency determination or
assessment by the Tax Administrator in connection
with an audit instituted by the Tax Administrator
pursuant to Section 3.26.170(d). A service supplier
shall not be entitled to such credit unless it clearly
establishes the right to the credit by written records
showing entitlement thereto. Under no circumstances
shall an overpayment taken as a credit against an
underpayment pursuant to this subsection qualify a
service supplier for a refund to which it would not
otherwise be entitled under the one-year written claim
requirement of this section.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.200 Appeals.
(a) Administrative appeals. The provisions of
this section apply to any decision (other than a decision
related to an exemption determination pursuant to
Section 3.26.030 or a decision relating to a refund
pursuant to Section 3.26.190). Any person otherwise
aggrieved by any decision, deficiency determination,
assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax
Administrator, shall be required to comply with the
appeals procedure of this section. Compliance with this
section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (See
Government Code Section 935(b).) Nothing herein
shall permit the filing of a claim or action on behalf of
a class or group of taxpayers except as otherwise
provided by law.
(b) Appeal of Tax Administrator's decision. If
any person is aggrieved by any such decision,
deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative
ruling of the Tax Administrator, he or she may appeal
by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within
14 days of the date of the decision, deficiency
determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of
the Tax Administrator which aggrieved said person.
(c) Scheduling of administrative appeal hearing.
The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before an
independent hearing officer selected by the City
Manager, no more than 30 days from the receipt of the
appeal. The appellant shall be served with notice of the
time and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant
materials, at least five calendar days prior to the
hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to
time upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing,
the appealing party, the Tax Administrator, and any
other interested person may present such relevant
ALP S-7
24T Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
evidence as he or she may have relating to the
determination from which the appeal is taken.
(d) Notice of decision. Based upon the
submission of such evidence and the review of the
City's files, the hearing officer shall issue a written
notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the
determination from which the appeal is taken. The
notice shall be given within 14 days after the
conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for
the decision. The notice shall specify that the decision
is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be
filed within 90 days from the date of the decision in
accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section
1094.6.
(e) Manner of notice. All notices under this
section may be sent by regular first class mail, postage
prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third
calendar day following the date of mailing, as
established by a proof of mailing.

3.26.210 Notice of changes to chapter.

increased, reduced, or the tax base is changed, the Tax
Administrator shall follow the notice requirements of
California Public Utilities Code Section 799 for
notification to service providers.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.220 Effect of State and Federal
reference–Authorization.
(a) Unless specifically provided otherwise, any
reference to a State or Federal statute in this chapter
shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time
to time, provided that such reference to a statute herein
shall not include any subsequent amendment thereto, or
to any subsequent change of interpretation thereto by a
State or Federal agency or court of law with the duty to
interpret such law, to the extent that such amendment
or change of interpretation would require voter
approval under California law, or to the extent that
such change would result in a tax decrease (as a result
of excluding all or a part of a communication service,
or charge therefore, from taxation). Only to the extent
voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax
decrease would result, the prior version of the statute
(or interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any
application or situation that would not require voter
approval or result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of
the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be
applicable to the maximum possible extent.
(b) To the extent that the City's authorization to
collect or impose any tax imposed under this chapter is
expanded or limited as a result of changes in State or
Federal law, no amendment or modification of this
chapter shall be required to conform the tax to those
changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to
the full extent of the authorization up to the full amount
of the tax imposed under this chapter.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.230 Independent audit.
The City shall annually verify that the taxes owed
under this chapter have been properly applied,
exempted, collected, and remitted in accordance with
this chapter, and properly expended according to
applicable law. The annual verification shall be
performed by a qualified, independent third party, and
the review shall employ reasonable, cost-effective steps
to assure compliance, including the use of sampling
audits.
(Ord. 156, passed 11-4-2014)
3.26.240 Effective date.
Service providers shall begin to collect the tax
imposed by this chapter as soon as feasible after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter,
but in no event later than January 1, 2015.

the City's Municipal Code, the California False Claims
Act (Government Code Section 12650 et seq.) and the
California Unfair Practices Act (Business and
Professions Code Section 17070 et seq.), are
cumulative. The use of one or more remedies by the
City shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

(3-12/90 § 3.24.010)
3.28.020 Definitions.
The following words and phrases shall, for the
purposes of this Chapter, be defined as follows, unless
it is clearly apparent from the context that another
meaning is intended.
(a) “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion
of any structure, which is occupied or intended or
designed for use or occupancy by transients, including
but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or
house, motel, public campsite or recreational vehicle
site, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house,
rooming house, apartment house, time-share project or
facility offered for public use, dormitory, public or
private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed
location, or other similar structure or portion thereof,
duplex, triplex, singlefamily dwelling units except any
private dwelling house or other individually owned
single-family dwelling house unit rented only
occasionally (infrequently) and incidentally to the
normal occupancy by the owner or his family; provided
that the burden of establishing that the housing or
facility is a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the
owner or operator thereof who shall file with the Tax
Administrator such information as the Tax
Administrator may require, to establish and maintain
such status.
(b) “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or
the right or entitlement to the use or possession, of any
hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for
rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes regardless of the purpose for which
such rooms are rented or provided.
(c) “Operator” means the person who is
proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of
25
26 Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee, or in any other capacity. Where the operator
performs his or its functions through a managing agent
of any type or character, the managing agent shall also
be deemed an operator for the purpose of this Chapter,
and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and
liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter by either the principal or the
managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.
(d) “Person” means any individual, firm,
partnership, joint venture, association, social club,
fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver,
trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination
acting as a unit.
(e) “Rent” means the amount of the
consideration charged or chargeable to the tenant or
person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of
space, valued in money whether received in money,
goods, labor or otherwise, including the full value of
receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind
or nature, without any deduction whatsoever. “Rent”
may have been, or may be in part, payable or paid prior
to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy to
which it is attributable, and may have been paid in
whole or in part in advance on a long-term basis, such
as in a time-share project or similar arrangement. It is
not the intent of this Subsection to make the operator
liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However,
uncollected rent must be reported.
(f) “Tax Administrator” means the City Manager
or his designated agent, whether a City employee or
County officer or employee.
(g) “Transient” means any person who exercises
occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of
concession, permit, right of access, license, or other
agreement of whatever nature, for a period of 30
consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying
space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his
actual total period of occupancy does not exceed 30
days, unless there is a written agreement between the
operator and occupant providing for a longer period of
occupancy. Unless days of occupancy or entitlement to
occupancy by one person are consecutive without any
break, then prior or subsequent periods of such
occupancy or entitlement to occupancy shall not be
counted when determining whether a period exceeds
the stated 30 calendar days.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.020)
3.28.030 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each
transient is subject to, and shall pay a tax in the amount
of 10% of the rent charged by the operator or otherwise
payable by the transient. Insofar as the transient is
concerned, said tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient to the operator or to the City. If the rent is
paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax
shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax
shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy
space in the hotel. If the tax is not paid to the hotel
operator, the Tax Administrator may require payment
directly to him.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.030)
3.28.040 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon any officer or
employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or
international treaty. No exemptions shall be granted
except upon written claim therefor made under penalty
of perjury at the time the rent is paid, upon a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Federal, State
and local officers and employees are not exempt.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.040)
3.28.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this
Chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the
rent is collected from every transient. The amount of
the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of
the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a
receipt of payment from the operator. No operator of
a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
Transient Occupancy Tax 27
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof
will be assumed or absorbed by the operator; or that it
will not be added to the rent; or that, if added, any part
will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.050)
3.28.060 Registration.
(a) Within 30 days after commencing business or
by January 1, 1991, every person desiring to engage in
or conduct business as operator of a hotel renting to
transients within the City shall file with the Tax
Administrator an application for a transient occupancy
registration permit for each place of business. Every
application for such a permit shall be made upon a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator and shall set forth
the name under which the applicant transacts or intends
to transact business, the location of his place of
business and such other information as the Tax
Administrator may require. The application shall be
signed by the owner if a natural person, if a member or
partner, if an association or partnership, by an
executive officer or some person specifically
authorized by the corporation to sign the application in
the case of a corporation. The transient occupancy
registration permit must be in effect at all times while

posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said
permit shall, among other things, state the following:
(1) Name of hotel;

(3) Hotel address;
(4) The date upon which the permit was
issued; and
(5) “This Transient Occupancy Registration
Permit signifies that the person named on the face
hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Chapter by registering with the Tax
Administrator for the purpose of collecting from
transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting
said tax to the Tax Administrator. This Permit does not
authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business
in an unlawful manner, nor operate a hotel without
strictly complying with all applicable laws, including
but not limited to those requiring a permit from any
board, commission, department or office of this City.
This Permit does not apply in lieu of such other permits
which are otherwise required.”
(b) At the time of making an application for a
registration permit, the applicant shall pay a
registration fee in an amount determined by the Council
for each permit issued.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.060)

collected by the operator; and
(b) Becomes delinquent and subject to penalties
if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before
the last working day of the month following the close

(3-12/90 § 3.24.070)
3.28.080 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last working
day of the month following the close of each calendar
month, file a return with the Tax Administrator on the
forms provided by him, of the total rents charged or
chargeable as provided in Section 3.28.030, whether or
not received, including any rentals charged for
occupancies exempt under the provisions of Section
3.28.040 and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies. Each such return shall contain a
declaration under penalty of perjury, executed by the
operator or his authorized agent, that to the best of the
signator’s knowledge, the statements in the return are
true, correct and complete. Amounts claimed on the
return as exempt from the tax pursuant to Sections
3.28.040 and 3.28.150 shall be fully itemized and
explained on the return or supporting schedule. In
determining the amount of “taxable receipts” on the tax
28 Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance

not be reduced by any business expenses including but
not limited to the amount of service charges deducted
by credit card companies or commissions paid to travel
agencies. At the time the return is filed, the tax fixed
at the prevailing transient occupancy tax rate for the
amount of rentals charged or chargeable, which are not
exempt from tax under Section 3.28.040 shall be
remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator may establish other reporting periods
and may require a cash deposit or bond or a separate
trust fund bank account for any permit holder if he
deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the
tax and he may require further information in the
return. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this
Chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City
until remittance thereof is made to the Tax
Administrator.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.080)

Any operator who fails to remit any tax to the City
or any amount of tax required to be collected and
remitted to the City including amounts based on

penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax in addition to
the amount of tax, plus interest at the rate of 0.5% per

w h i c h t h e p e n a l t y
becomes due and payable to the City until the date of
payment.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.100)
3.28.110 Fraud.
If the Tax Administrator determines that the
failure to make any remittance or payment due under
this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 100% of the
amount of the tax and penalties shall be added thereto
in addition to the penalties stated in Section 3.28.100.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.110)
3.28.120 Failure to collect and report tax-
-Determination of Tax Administrator.
If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax
and to make, within the time provided in this Chapter,
any report and remittance of said tax or any portion
thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator
shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to
obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate on the tax due. As soon as the Tax
Administrator procures such facts and information as
he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment
of any tax imposed by the Chapter payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same
and make such report and remittance, he shall proceed
to determine and assess against such operator the tax,
interest and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In
case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving
it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepared, addressed to the operator so
assessed at his last known address. Such operator may
within ten days after the serving or mailing of such
notice make application in writing to the Tax
Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If
application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator
shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable. If such application is made, the Tax
Administrator shall give not less than five days written
notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
Transient Occupancy Tax 29
to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice
why said amount specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing,
the operator may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so
fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of the determination and the
amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable within fifteen
days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
3.28.130.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.120)
3.28.130 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax
Administrator with respect to the amount of any tax,
interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the City
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk
within 15 days of serving of the assessment or
determination of tax and penalties, if any, due. The
City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing the
appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing
to the operator at his last known address. The findings
of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner
prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the
collection and remittance to the City of any tax
imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, in the
City, for a period of three years, records in such form

amount of such tax. The Tax Administrator shall have
the right to inspect such records at all reasonable times
and may subpoena the records of any operator who
refuses to make them available for examination.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.140)
3.28.150 Refunds.
(a) Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or
penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or
has been erroneously or illegally collected or received
by the City under this Chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in Subsections (b) and (c) of this Section,
provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under
penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator
within three years of the date of payment. The claims
shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
(b) An operator may claim a refund or take as
credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount
overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established in
a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the
person from whom the tax has been collected was not
a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor
a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so
collected has either been refunded to the person or
credited to rent subsequently payable by the person to
the operator.
(c) A transient may obtain a refund of taxes
overpaid or paid more than once erroneously or
illegally collected or received by the City by filing a
claim in the manner provided in Subsection (a) of this
Section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient
directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient
having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient
has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator
who collected the tax.
(d) No refund shall be paid under the provisions
of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right
thereto by written records.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.150)
3.28.160 Revocation of permit.
Whenever any operator fails to comply with any
provision of this Chapter relating to occupancy tax or
any rule or regulation of the Tax Administrator relating
to occupancy tax prescribed and adopted under this
30 Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
Chapter, the Tax Administrator upon hearing, after
giving the operator ten days’ notice in writing
specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring
him to show cause why his permit or permits should
not be revoked, may suspend or revoke any one or more
of the permits held by the operator. The Tax
Administrator shall give to the operator written notice
of the suspension or revocation of any of his permits.
The notices herein required may be served personally
or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of
notice of a deficiency determination. The Tax
Administrator shall not issue a new permit after the
revocation of a permit unless he is satisfied that the
former holder of the permit will comply with the
provisions of this Chapter relating to the occupancy tax
and regulations of the Tax Administrator.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.160)
3.28.170 Closure of hotel without permit.
During any period of time during which a permit
has not been issued, or is suspended, revoked or
otherwise not validly in effect, the Tax Administrator
may require that the hotel be closed.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.170)
3.28.180 Recording certificate--Lien.
If any amount required to be remitted or paid to
the City under this Chapter is not remitted or paid when
due, the Tax Administrator may, within three years
after the amount is due, file for record in the office of
the County of Riverside Recorder a certificate
specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due,
the name and address as it appears on the records of the
Tax Administrator of the operator liable for the same,
and the fact that the Tax Administrator has complied
with all provisions of this Chapter in the determination
of the amount required to be remitted and paid. From
the time of the filing for record, the amount required to
be remitted together with penalties and interest shall
constitute a lien upon all real property in the County
owned by the operator or afterwards and before the lien
expires acquired by him. The lien has the force, effect
and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for
ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless
sooner released or otherwise discharged.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.180)
3.28.190 Priority and lien of tax.
(a) The amounts required to be remitted and/or
paid by any operator under this Chapter with penalties
and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the
following cases:
(1) Whenever the person is insolvent;
(2) Whenever the person makes a voluntary
assignment of his assets;
(3) Whenever the estate of the person in the
hands of executors, administrators, or heirs is
insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased;
(4) Whenever the estate and effects of an
absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay
any amount under this Chapter are levied upon by
process law. This Chapter does not give the City a
preference over any recorded lien which attached prior
to the date when the amounts required to be paid
became a lien.
(b) The preference given to the City by this
Section shall be subordinate to the preferences given to
claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and 1206
of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.190)
3.28.200 Warrant for collection of tax.
At any time within three years after any operator
is delinquent in the remittance or payment of any
amount herein required to be remitted or paid or within
three years after the last recording of a certificate under
Section 3.28.160, the Tax Administrator may issue a
warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the
collection of any amount required to be paid to the City
under this Chapter. The warrant shall be directed to
any sheriff, marshal, or constable and shall have the
Transient Occupancy Tax 31
same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall
be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same
manner with the same effect as a levy of and a sale
pursuant to a writ of execution. The Tax Administrator
may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal, or constable
the. same fees, commissions and expenses for his
services as are provided by law for similar services
pursuant to a writ of execution. The Tax
Administrator, and not the court, shall approve the fees
for publication in a newspaper.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.200)
3.28.210 Seizure and sale.
At any time within three years after any operator
is delinquent in the remittance or payment of any
amount, the Tax Administrator may forthwith collect
the amount in the following manner. The Tax
Administrator shall seize any property, real or personal,
of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part
of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together
with any penalties and interest imposed for the
delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the
seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect
occupancy taxes due shall be only of property of the
operator not exempt from execution under the
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.210)
3.28.220 Successor’s liability--Withholding by
purchase.
If any operator liable for any amount under this
Chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his
successor or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the
purchase price to cover such amount until the former
owner produces a receipt from the Tax Administrator
showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that
no amount is due.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.220)
3.28.230 Liability of purchaser--Release.

valued in money. Within 60 days after receiving a
written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or
within 60 days from the date the former owner's
records are made available for audit, whichever period
expires the later, but in any event not later than 90 days
after receiving the request, the Tax Administrator shall
either issue the certificate or mail notice to the
purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of
the Tax Administrator of the amount that must be paid
as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the
Tax Administrator to mail the notice will release the
purchaser from any further obligation to withhold
purchase price as above provided. The time within
which the obligation of the successor may be enforced
shall start to run at the time the operator sells his
business or at the time that the determination against
the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the
later.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.230)
3.28.240 Responsibility for payment.
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under
the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt
owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been remitted to
the City is a fiduciary obligation of the operator to the
City and collectible in the same manner as a debt. Any
person owing money to the City under the provisions of
this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the
name of the City of Canyon Lake for the recovery of
such amount.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.240)
3.28.250 Withhold notice.
If any person or operator is delinquent in the
remittance or payment of the amount required to be
remitted or paid by him or in the event a determination
has been made against him for the remittance of tax and
payment of the penalty, the City may, within three
years after the tax obligation became due, give notice
thereof personally or by registered mail to all persons,
including the State or any political subdivision thereof,
32 Canyon Lake - Revenue and Finance
having in their possession or under their control any
credits or other personal property belonging to the
taxpayer. After receiving the withholding notice, the
person no notified shall make no disposition of the
taxpayer’s credits, other personal property or debts
until the City consents to a transfer or disposition or
until 60 days elapse after the receipt of the notice,
whichever expires earlier. All persons, upon receipt of
said notice, shall advise the City immediately of all
such credits, other personal property or debts in their
possession, under their control or owing by them. If
such notice seeks to prevent the transfer or other
disposition of a deposit in a bank or other credits or
personal property in the possession or under the control
of the bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered
or mailed to the branch or office of such bank at which
such deposit is carried or at which such credits or
personal property is held. If any person so notified
makes transfer or disposition of the property or debts
required to be held hereunder during the effective
period of the notice to withhold, he shall be liable to
the City to the extent of the value of the release up to
the amount of the indebtedness owed by the taxpayer to
the City.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.250)
3.28.260 Violations--Misdemeanor.
(a) Except for failure of an operator to pay to the
Tax Administrator taxes collected under this Chapter
which is punishable as a felony pursuant to Section 424
of the Penal Code, every violation of this Chapter is a
misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not exceeding
$500 or imprisonment in the County jail for not more
than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.
(b) If such offense is not otherwise punishable as
mentioned in (a) above, any person willfully failing to
comply with, or knowingly violating, any of the
provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
(c) Any operator or other person who willfully
fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to
furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data
required by the Tax Administrator, or who renders a
false or fraudulent return or claim is guilty of a
misdemeanor. Any person required to make, render,
sign or verify any report or claim who willfully makes
any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to
defeat or evade the determination of any amount due
required by this Chapter to be made, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.260)
3.28.270 Extension of time.
The Tax Administrator, for good cause, may
extend for not to exceed one month the time for making
any return or paying any amount required to be paid
under this Chapter. The extension may be granted at
any time, provided a request therefore is filed with the
Tax Administrator within or prior to the period for
which the extension may be granted. Any person to
whom an extension is granted shall pay, in addition to
the tax, interest at the rate of one percent per month or
fraction thereof, from the date on which the tax would
have been due without the extension until the date of
payment.
(3-12/90 § 3.24.270)
3.28.280 Divulging of information forbidden.
It is unlawful for any person having an
administrative duty under this Chapter to make known
in any manner whatever the business affairs,

CHAPTER 5.24: LICENSURE OF TOBACCO RETAILERS
Section
5.24.010 Purpose and intent.

application and renewal process.
5.24.040 License issuance or renewal;

5.24.100 Enforcement.
5.24.010 Purpose and intent.
The City of Canyon Lake has a substantial interest
in promoting compliance with Federal, State, and local
laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use; in
discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products
by minors; in promoting compliance with laws
prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to
minors; and finally, and most importantly, in protecting
children from being lured into illegal activity through
the misconduct of adults. It is the intent of this chapter
to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to
discourage violations of tobacco-related laws at the
local level as allowed by State, especially those that
prohibit or discourage the sale or distribution of
tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce
the degree to which the acts regulated by Federal or
State law are criminally proscribed or to alter the
penalty provided therefore or to regulate in areas
already preempted.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following
words and terms shall have the following meanings:
(a) “Arm's length transaction” means a sale in
good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects
the fair market value in the open market between two
informed and willing, parties, neither under any
compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale
between relatives, related companies or partners, or a
sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of
the violations of this chapter is presumed not to be an
arm's length transaction.
(b) “Business” means any sole proprietorship,
partnership, joint venture, corporation or other business
entity formed for profit-making purposes, including
retail establishments where goods or services are sold,
as well as professional corporations and other entities
where legal, medical, dental, engineering architectural
or other professional services are delivered.
(c) “City” shall mean the City of Canyon Lake or
its designee hereunder for the administration and
enforcement of this chapter.
(d) “Department” shall mean the Riverside
County Department of Health and Human Services or
other county department, if so designated by the City
Council by written contract, or any City department
designated to administer and/or enforce the provisions
of this chapter.
(e) “Proprietor” shall mean a person with an
ownership or managerial interest in a business. An
ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a
16A ALP S-7
16B Canyon Lake - Business Regulations
person has a 10% or greater interest in the stock, assets,
or income of a business other than the sole interest of
security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed
to exist when a person can or does have, or can or does
share ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of
a business.
(f) “Retail tobacco store” means a retail store
utilized primarily for the sale of tobacco products and
accessories; and in which at least 80% of the square
footage of the available retail floor and shelf space is
devoted to the sale of tobacco-related products and
accessories. Operation of a hookah lounge as defined
by City ordinance does not fall within the definition of
a “retail tobacco store.”
(g) “Self-service display” shall mean the open
display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in
a manner that is accessible to the general public
without the assistance of the retailer or employee of the
retailer. A vending machine is a form of self-service
display.
(h) “Smoking” shall mean possessing a lighted
tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other
weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, lighted cigar, or
lighted cigarette of any kind), the lighting of a tobacco
product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or
plant (including a pipe, cigar, or cigarette of any kind).
(i) “Tobacco paraphernalia” shall mean cigarette
papers or wrappers, pipes, holders of smoking materials
of all types, cigarette rolling machines, and any other
item designed for the smoking, preparation, storing, or
consumption of tobacco products.
(j) “Tobacco product” shall mean (1) any
substance containing tobacco leaf, including but not
limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff,
chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, bidis, or any other
preparation of tobacco; and (2) any product or
formulation of matter containing biologically active
amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered
for sale, or otherwise distributed with the expectation
that the product or matter will be introduced into the
human body but does not include any product
specifically approved by the Federal Food and Drug
Administration for use in treating nicotine or tobacco
product dependence.
(k) “Tobacco retailer” shall mean any person
who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers to exchange
for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco
products, or tobacco paraphernalia; “tobacco retailing”
shall mean the doing of any of these things. This
definition is without regard to the quantity of tobacco,
tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia sold,
offered for sale, exchanged, or offered for exchange.
(l) Notwithstanding, as used herein, this chapter
shall not be applicable to tobacco products either i)
offered for sale in a golf shop operated by a private
homeowners association whose purpose is not the sale
of tobacco products; or ii) made available only to
members or guests of such private homeowners
association, in a private bar or restaurant or private club
operated by such homeowners association.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.030 Tobacco license prerequisite; application
and renewal process.
(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except for
a retail tobacco store, to act as a tobacco retailer
without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco
retailer's license pursuant to this chapter for each
location at which that activity is to occur and to do so
without a valid tobacco retailer's license shall constitute
a public nuisance. As used herein, “license” shall
include any required review of a license.
(b) A tobacco retailer (including the proprietor of
a tobacco retailer) without a valid tobacco retailer's
license, including, for example, a revoked license:
(1) Shall keep all tobacco products and
tobacco paraphernalia from public view. The public
display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in
violation of this provision shall constitute an “offer for
sale” for the purposes of Section 5.24.040(c) hereof.
(2) Shall not display any advertisement
relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia
that promotes the sale or distribution of such products
from the tobacco retailer's location or that would lead
a reasonable consumer to believe that such products
can be obtained at the tobacco retailer's location.
ALP S-7
Licensure of Tobacco Retailers 16C
(c) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco
retailer's license any status or right other than the right
to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the City
identified on the face of the license. For example,
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render
inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of any other
provision of applicable law, including, without
limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in
enclosed places of employment made applicable to
business establishments by California Labor Code
Section 6404.5.
(d) Applications for a tobacco retailer's license or
for an annual renewal of that license shall be submitted
to the City or its designee, utilizing a form provided by
the City or its designee, which application shall be in
the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail
tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or
an authorized agent thereof. It is the responsibility of
each proprietor to be informed of the laws affecting the
issuance of a tobacco retailer's license. A license that is
issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading
information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked
pursuant to Section 5.24.100 hereof.
(e) In addition to any other penalty under this
chapter, a person found to have engaged in tobacco
retailing without a valid tobacco retailers license shall
be ineligible to apply for or be issued a tobacco
retailing license according to the following:
(1) After a first violation for a person within
any 60-month period, no new license may issue for the
person as a proprietor until 30 days have passed from
the date of last violation.
(2) After a second violation for a person
within any 60-month period, no new license may issue
for the person as a proprietor until 90 days have passed
from the date of last violation.
(3) After three or more violations for a
person within any 60-month period, no new license
may issue for the person as a proprietor until five years
have passed from the date of last violation.
(4) Each day that a person engages in
tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailers
license shall constitute a separate violation.
(f) Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia
offered for sale or exchange in violation of this chapter
are subject to seizure and forfeiture. Forfeited tobacco
products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed.
(g) All applications or renewals shall contain the
following information:
(1) The current name, address, and
telephone number of each proprietor.
(2) The current business name, address, and
telephone number of the single fixed location for which
a tobacco retailer's license is sought.
(3) The current name and mailing address
authorized by each proprietor to receive all
license-related communications and notices; unless a
different mailing address is provided, each proprietor
shall be understood to consent to the provision of
notice at the business address specified above.
(4) Current proof that the location for which
a tobacco retailer's license is sought has been issued a
valid state tobacco retailer's license by the California
Board of Equalization.
(5) Whether or not any proprietor is a
person who has been determined to have violated this
chapter or has been a proprietor at a location that has
been determined to have violated this chapter and, if so,
the dates and locations of all such violations.
(6) For a renewal, any change in the
information listed during the prior year.
(7) Such other information as the City
deems necessary for the administration or enforcement
of this chapter.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
ALP S-7
16D Canyon Lake - Business Regulations
5.24.040 License issuance or renewal; standards.
(a) No license (including any renewal) may issue
to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a fixed
location, i.e. no license shall issue for tobacco retailing
by persons on foot or from a vehicle of any kind.
(b) Upon the receipt of an application (including
a renewal) for a tobacco retailer's license and the
license fee therefor, the City or its designee shall issue
a license or renewal unless substantial record evidence
demonstrates that one of the following bases for denial
exists:
(1) The application is incomplete or
inaccurate.
(2) The application seeks authorization for
tobacco retailing at a location for which a prohibition
on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to this chapter.
However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for
denial of a license if the applicant provides the City
with documentation demonstrating that the applicant
has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in
an arm's length transaction.
(3) The application seeks authorization for
tobacco retailing for a proprietor for which a
prohibition on issuing licenses is in effect pursuant to
this chapter.
(4) The application seeks authorization for
tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to this
chapter, that is unlawful pursuant to any other City
ordinance, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other
local, State, or Federal law.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.050 License non-transferable.
(a) A tobacco retailer's license (including a
renewal license) is nontransferable. If the information
required in the license application changes, a new
tobacco retailer's license is required before the business
may continue to act as a tobacco retailer. For example,
if a proprietor to whom a license has been issued
changes business location, that proprietor must apply
for a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at
the new location. Or if the business is sold, the new
owner must apply for a license for that location before
acting as a tobacco retailer.
(b) Notwithstanding, any other provision of this
chapter, violations accumulated against a location or
business shall continue to be counted against the
location or business unless the location or business has
been transferred to a new proprietor and the new
proprietor provides the City with documentation
demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that
the new proprietor has acquired or is acquiring the
location or business in an arm's length transaction.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.060 License term, renewal and reinstatement
after expiration; fees.
(a) Term. The term of a tobacco retailer license
is one year from the date of issuance or renewal. A
tobacco retailer's license is invalid unless the
appropriate fee has been paid in full and the term of the
license has not expired.
(b) Renewal. Each tobacco retailer shall apply
for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer's license
no later than 30 days prior to expiration of the term.
(c) Reinstatement after expiration. A tobacco
retailer's license that is not timely renewed shall expire
at the end of its term. To reinstate a license that has
expired due to the failure to renew, the proprietor shall
submit the renewal fee plus a reinstatement fee of 10%
of the renewal fee and submit a signed declaration
stating the reason for the failure to renew the license in
a timely manner. Unless the proprietor can show that he
has not sold any tobacco product or tobacco
paraphernalia during any period that the license was
expired, the proprietor may be subject to additional
penalties for violation of this chapter.
(d) Fees. The fees applicable to this chapter
shall be determined by resolution of the City Council.
Reinstatement fee shall be at least 10% of renewal fee.

prohibitions.
(a) Display of license. Each license shall be
prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at
the licensed location in such a manner and size that it
may be easily read.
(b) Positive identification required. If the
purchaser reasonably appears to be under the age of 30,

the identification of the purchaser to confirm that the
proposed sale is to a purchaser who is at least the
minimum age under State law for purchasing the
tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia.

person shall engage in tobacco retailing if the person is
younger than the minimum age under State law for
being sold or for possessing any tobacco product.

shall display tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia
by means of a self-service display or engage in tobacco
retailing by means of a self-service display. A tobacco
retailer who chooses to display tobacco products or
tobacco paraphernalia in a locked cabinet, case or
similar structure shall post a clear and conspicuous sign
on or within five feet of the display stating that the
cabinet, case or structure is locked at all times and must
keep the cabinet locked when not removing products
for sale, restocking, or cleaning or maintaining the
cabinet.
(e) Violation of tobacco-related laws. It shall be
a violation of a tobacco retailer's license for a licensee,
including his or her agent or employee, to violate any
local, State, or Federal tobacco-related law, including
but not limited to those regarding signage or those
restricting the age of purchase for any product.
(Ord. 99, passed 6-3-2009)
5.24.080 Compliance monitoring.
(a) Compliance with this chapter shall be
monitored by the City or its designee. Any peace
officer may enforce the provisions of this chapter.
(b) Notwithstanding, neither the City nor its
designee shall not enforce any tobacco-related
minimum-age law against a person who otherwise
might be in violation of such law because of the
person's age (the “youth decoy”) if the potential
violation occurs when:
(1) The youth decoy is participating in a
compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a
code enforcement official; or
(2) The youth decoy is participating in a
compliance check funded in part, either directly or
indirectly through sub-contracting, by the City, the

Services or a law enforcement agency.

5.24.090 Revocation of license.
(a) Revocation of license for violation.
(1) In addition to any other penalty
authorized by law, a tobacco retailer's license may be
revoked if the City or its designee finds, after the

heard as provided in Section 2.01.100 of this Code or
pursuant to substantially equivalent procedures
delegated to the County, that the licensee, or any of the
licensee's agents or employees, has violated any of the
requirements, conditions or prohibitions of this chapter
or has otherwise admitted to a violation of this chapter.
(2) For a first or second alleged violation
within any five-year period, and in order to avoid a
hearing, the City or its designee is authorized to enter
into a settlement with the proprietor without additional
consent of the City Counsel, which settlement shall not
be confidential and which shall contain the following
minimum terms:
A. After an alleged first license
violation at a location within any 60-month period:

1. An agreement to stop acting as
a tobacco retailer for at least ten business days;

location within any 60-month period, no new license
may issue for the location until 90 days have passed
from the date of the last revocation or violation,
whichever is later.
(4) After four or more license violations at
a location within any 60-month period, no new license
may issue, for the location until five years have passed
from the date of the last revocation or violation,
whichever is later.
(c) Revocation of license issued in error. A
tobacco retailer's license shall be revoked if the
Department finds, after notice and opportunity to be
heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a
license under this chapter existed at the time
application was made or at any time before the license
issued. The revocation shall be without prejudice to
the filing of a new application for a license.
(d) No contest plea. To the extent allowed by
law, a plea of “no contest” or its equivalent by a
tobacco retailer for a violation of any law designated in
subsection (a) above shall operate as an admission that
this chapter has been violated for the purposes of
license revocation.

5.24.100 Enforcement.
The remedies provided by this chapter are

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or Section
6.01.130 hereof, should conditions warrant at any

increased frequency of collection. No accumulation of
solid waste shall be allowed to create a public nuisance,
and such accumulation shall be a public nuisance

City or its agent a charge in such amounts and in such
manner as shall be established by the City for the
service of having such ordinary household garbage,
solid waste, recyclables or organic waste, collected and
removed from the place or premises by the exclusive
contractor. In the case of residential and commercial
rental units, the property owner of record ultimately

(b) Nothing in this Section is intended to prevent
an arrangement, or the continuance of an existing
arrangement, under which payments of refuse
collection fees are made by a tenant or tenants, or any
agent, on behalf of the owner. However, any such
arrangement will not affect the property owner’s
obligation to the contractor.
(c) All fees for service shall be proposed by the
contractor and approved by the City Council by
resolution. Fees shall be based on the type of
occupancy or use of the place or premises.
(d) All fees (and any penalty) for collection

refuse to collect solid waste, organic waste or
recyclables from the premises until the bill is paid or
the matter otherwise is resolved.

the City shall cause a written report to be prepared and
filed with the City Clerk. The report shall describe
each parcel in the city receiving solid waste collection
services and the charge for such services for the next

hearing.
(d) At the hearing, the City Council shall hear

assessed for fees and may make such revisions or
corrections to the report as it deems just, after which,
by resolution, the report may be confirmed. The City
Clerk shall file the report with the County Auditor
before August 10 of each year.
(e) The fees set forth in the report as confirmed
shall constitute special assessments against the
respective parcels of land, and are a lien on the
property for the amount of such delinquent fees plus
administrative costs. A certified copy of the confirmed
report shall be filed with the County Auditor for
amounts of the respective parcels of land as they appear
on the current assessment roll. The lien created
attaches upon recordation, in the office of the County
recorder, of a certified copy of the resolution of
confirmation. The assessment may be collected at the
same time and subject to the same procedures,
including sale in case of delinquency, as provided for
such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection
and enforcement of ad valorem property taxes shall be
applicable to such assessments, except that, if any real
property to which such fees or charges relate has been
transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for
value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value
has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of such taxes would
become delinquent, then the lien which would
otherwise be imposed shall not attach to such real
property and the fees or charges and interest shall be
transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

4/5ths vote adopt an ordinance, levy and collect an
annual standby charge on unimproved property for
solid waste capacity and collection and to meet
obligations under AB 939, as it may be revised from
time to time. By resolution approved by 4/5ths vote of
the City Council, such charges may be collected in the
same manner, by the same persons and at the same time
and together with real property general taxes. In such
event, the City Council shall:
(a) Annually cause a written report to be filed
with the City Clerk, describing each parcel and the
amount of the charge;
(b) Give notice of the charge and a hearing
thereon shall be given as set out in Health & Safety
Code Section 5473.1;
(c) At the time of the hearing, hear and consider
any and all protests to the report. In the event of a
protest by the owners of a majority of separate parcels,
the report shall not be approved;
(d) Absent a majority protest, approve the report
and file it with the County Auditor as set out in
Section 5473.4 of the Health & Safety Code; and
(e) The charges set out in the report shall
constitute a lien on the property in the same manner as
real property taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and
enforcement of general taxes of the entity, including,
but not limited to, those pertaining to the matters of
delinquency, correction, cancellation, refund and
redemption, are applicable to such charges, except that
if any real property to which such charges relate has
been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser
for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for
value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to
the date on which the first installment of such taxes
would become delinquent, then the lien which would
otherwise be imposed shall not attach to such real
property and the charges relating to such property shall
be transferred to the unsecured roll of collection.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
8.35.010 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has in
Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800
conferred upon local governments the authority to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Canyon Lake
does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations. This Chapter meets and
exceeds the minimum standards for the State of
California, as recommended by FEMA, and as
requested in coordination with the Engineer for the
Property Owner’s Association.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.020 Findings of fact.
(a) The flood hazard areas of Canyon Lake are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
27
ALP S-6
28 Canyon Lake - Building and Construction
(b) These flood losses are caused by uses that are
inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or protected from
flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazards which increase flood
heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses.
(c) This Chapter meets and exceeds the minimum
standards for the State of California, as recommended
by FEMA, and as requested in coordination with the
Engineer for the Property Owner’s Association.
Community adoption of higher standards can be
applied towards credit under the Community Rating
System (CRS) program and result in reduced premiums
for all flood insurance policy holders within the entire
community.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable
regulations applied uniformly throughout the
community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood-prone, mudslide [i.e., mudflow] or flood
related erosion areas. These regulations are designed
to:
(a) Protect human life and health;
(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for
costly flood control projects;
(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief
efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and
utilities such as water and gas mains; electric,
telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing
for the sound use and development of areas of special
flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas
caused by flood damage;
(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that
property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
(h) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of
special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter
includes regulations to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous
to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or flood heights or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which
help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

public. In examining this requirement, the City Council
will consider the fact that every newly constructed
building adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years.
Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below
the base flood elevation are subject during all those
years to increased risk of damage from floods, while
future owners of the property and the community as a
whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience,
danger, and suffering that those increased flood
damages bring. In addition, future owners may
purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to
potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very
high flood insurance rates.
“Functionally dependent use” means a use which
cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located
or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are
necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or
passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities,
and does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
“Governing body” is the local governing unit (the
City) that is empowered to adopt and implement
regulations to provide for the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry.
“Hardship” as related to Sections 8.35.500 through
8.35.520 means the exceptional hardship that would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The City Council requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property
involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is
not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors
likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional
hardship. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even
if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the
property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to
a different use than originally intended.
“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest
natural elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
“Historic structure” means any structure that is:
(1) Listed individually in the National
Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by
the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listing on the National
Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by
the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the
historical significance of a registered historic district or
a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
(3) Individually listed on a State inventory
of historic places in states with historic preservation
programs which have been approved by the Secretary
of Interior; or
(4) Individually listed on a local inventory
of historic places in communities with historic
preservation programs that have been certified either by
an approved State program as determined by the
Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of
the Interior in States without approved programs.
“Levee” means a man-made structure, usually an

which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated
structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accord with sound
engineering practices.
“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the
lowest enclosed area, including basement. (See
“Basement” definition).
(1) An unfinished or flood resistant
enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an
area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to
applicable non-elevation design requirements,
including, but not limited to:
(A) The flood openings standard in
Section 8.35.300(c)(3);
(B) The anchoring standards in Section
8.35.300(a);
(C) The construction materials and
methods standards in Section 8.35.300(b); and
(D) The standards for utilities in
Section 8.35.310.
“Manufactured home” means a structure,
transportable in one or more sections, which is built on
a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the
required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does
not include a “recreational vehicle.”
“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means
a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
“Market value” shall be determined by estimating
the cost to replace the structure in new condition and
adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation
which has accrued since the structure was constructed.
(1) The cost of replacement of the structure
shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined
by reference to a building cost estimating guide
recognized by the building construction industry.
(2) The amount of depreciation shall be
determined by taking into account the age and physical
deterioration of the structure and functional
obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain
Administrator, but shall not include economic or other
forms of external obsolescence.
Use of replacement costs or accrued
depreciation factors different from those contained in
recognized building cost estimating guides may be
considered only if such factors are included in a report
prepared by an independent professional appraiser and
supported by a written explanation of the differences.
“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the
National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other
datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
“Mudslide” describes a condition where there is a
river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside,
usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush
cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the
ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or
sustained rain.
“Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area” means an
area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated
material where the history, geology, and climate
indicate a potential for mudflow.
“New construction,” for floodplain management
purposes, means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after January 7, 1998,
and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
“New manufactured home park or subdivision”
means a manufactured home park or subdivision for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
ALP S-6
Floodplain Management Regulations 33
(including at a minimum, the installation of utilities,
the construction of streets, and either final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or
after January 7, 1998.
“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any
dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, protection, excavation, channelization,
bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock,
gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other
material in, along, across or projecting into any
watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change
the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or
due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect
debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of
being carried downstream.
“One-hundred-year flood” or “100-year flood.”
See “Base flood.”
“Program deficiency” means a defect in a
community’s floodplain management regulations or
administrative procedures that impairs effective
implementation of those floodplain management
regulations.
“Public safety and nuisance” as related to Sections
8.35.500 through 8.35.520, means that the granting of
a variance must not result in anything which is
injurious to safety or health of an entire community or
neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons,
or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the
customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay,
stream, canal, or basin.
“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
(1) Built on a single chassis;
(2) Four hundred square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal projection;
(3) Designed to be self-propelled or
permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
(4) Designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
“Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a
river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot.
“Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure
or other development into compliance with State or
local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is
not possible, to reduce the impacts of its
noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced
include protecting the structure or other affected
development from flood damages, implementing the
enforcement provisions of this Chapter or otherwise
deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or
Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure
or other development.
“Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or
resembling a river (including tributaries), stream,
brook, etc.
“Sheet flow area.” See “Area of shallow
flooding.”
“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area
in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or
FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
“Start of construction” includes substantial
improvement and other proposed new development and
means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days from the date
of the permit. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on
a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any
work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement
of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of seawalls, streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary
forms; nor does it include the installation on the
ALP S-6
34 Canyon Lake - Building and Construction
property of accessory buildings, such as garages, shade
structures or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
“Structure” means a walled and roofed building
that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or
liquid storage tank or a manufactured home, and
excludes shade structures, boat shade structures, and
boat docks that are exempt from the CLOMR/LOMR
process.
“Substantial damage” means:
(1) Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to
its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred; or
(2) Flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each
such event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred. This is also known as “repetitive loss.”
“Substantial improvement” means any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before
the “start of construction” of the improvement. This
term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The term does not, however, include
either:
(1) Any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations or state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or
(2) Any alteration of a “historic structure,”
provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a “historic
structure.”
“Variance” means a grant of relief from the
requirements of this chapter which permits construction
in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
Chapter.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or
other development to be fully compliant with this
Chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required in this Chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
“Water surface elevation” means the height, in
relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum
(NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
coastal or riverine areas.
“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream,
wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on
or over which waters flow at least periodically.

ALP S-6
36 Canyon Lake - Building and Construction
8.35.210 Duties and responsibilities of the
Floodplain Administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain
Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the
following:
(a) Permit review. Review all development
permits to determine:
(1) Permit requirements of this Chapter have
been satisfied, including determination of substantial
improvement and substantial damage of existing
structures;
(2) All other required State and Federal
permits have been obtained;
(3) The site is reasonably safe from
flooding;
(4) The proposed development does not
adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where
base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated. This means that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any
point within the City of Canyon Lake; and
(5) All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs)
for flood control projects are approved prior to the
issuance of building permits. Building permits must not
be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map
Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow
construction of the proposed flood control project and
land preparation as specified in the “start of
construction” definition.
(b) Development of substantial improvement and
substantial damage procedures.
(1) Using FEMA publication FEMA 213,
“Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged
Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying
and administering requirements for substantial
improvement and substantial damage, to include
defining “market value.”
(2) Assure procedures are coordinated with
other departments/divisions and implemented by
community staff.
(c) Review, use and development of other base
flood data.
(1) When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with Section 8.35.070, the
Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a Federal or State agency,
or other source, in order to administer Sections
8.35.300 through 8.35.370.
(2) NOTE: Based on locally accepted
information, Canyon Lake has established a Base Flood
Elevation (BFE) of 1395.3.
(d) Notification of other agencies.
(1) Alteration or relocation of a
watercourse:
(A) Notify adjacent communities and
the California Department of Water Resources prior to
alteration or relocation;
(B) Submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency; and
(C) Assure that the flood carrying
capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse is maintained.
(2) Base flood elevation changes due to
physical alterations.
(A) Within six months of information
becoming available or project completion, whichever
comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit
or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or
scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR).
(B) All LOMRs for flood control
projects are approved prior to the issuance of building
permits. Building permits must not be issued based on
ALP S-6
Floodplain Management Regulations 37
Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs).
Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed
flood control project and land preparation as specified
in the “start of construction” definition.
Such submissions are necessary so that
upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting
flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.
(3) Changes in corporate boundaries. Notify
FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries
have been modified by annexation or other means and
include a copy of a map of the community clearly
delineating the new corporate limits.
(e) Documentation of floodplain development.
Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make
available as needed the following:
(1) Certification required by Sections
8.35.300(c)(1) and Section 8.35.330 (lowest floor
elevations);
(2) Certification required by Section
8.35.300(c)(2) (elevation or flood-proofing of
nonresidential structures);
(3) Certification required by Section
8.35.300(c)(3) (wet flood-proofing standard);
(4) Certification of elevation required by
Section 8.35.320(a)(3) (subdivisions and other
proposed development standards);
(5) Certification required by Section
5.35.350 (floodway encroachments); and
(6) Maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(f) Map determination. Make interpretations
where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section 8.35.230.
(g) Remedial action. Take action to remedy
violations of this Chapter as specified in Section
8.35.080.
(h) Biennial report. Complete and submit
biennial report to FEMA.
(I) Planning. Assure community’s General Plan
is consistent with floodplain management objectives
herein.
(j) Non-conversion of enclosed areas below the
lowest floor. To ensure that the areas below the BFE
shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited
storage, or access to the building and not be finished
for use as human habitation without first becoming
fully compliant with the floodplain management
ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
(1) Determine which applicants for new
construction and/or substantial improvements have
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are five
feet or higher;
(2) Enter into a “non-conversion agreement
for construction within flood hazard areas” or
equivalent with the City of Canyon Lake. The
agreement shall be recorded with the Riverside County
Recorder as a deed restriction. The non-conversion
agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the
Floodplain Administrator and County Counsel; and
(3) Have the authority to inspect any area of
a structure below the base flood elevation to ensure
compliance upon prior notice of at least 72 hours.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD
REDUCTION
8.35.300 Standards of construction.
In all areas of special flood hazards the following
standards are required:
(a) Anchoring. All new construction and
substantial improvements of structures, including
manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
(b) Construction materials and methods. All new
construction and substantial improvements of
structures, including manufactured homes, shall be
constructed:
(1) With flood resistant materials, and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage for areas below
the base flood elevation;
(2) Using methods and practices that
minimize flood damage;
(3) With electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding; and
(4) Within Zones AH or AO, so that there
are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
ALP S-6

elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent
grade if no depth number is specified.
(C) In an A zone, without BFEs
specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A zone], elevated
to at least two feet above the base flood elevation; as
determined under Section 8.35.210(c).
Upon the completion of the structure, the
elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall
be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed
land surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification
and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator.

construction or substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to
conform with Section 8.35.300(c)(1) or:
(A) Be flood-proofed, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the
elevation recommended under Section 8.35.300(c)(1),
so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(B) Have structural components capable
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy; and
(C) Be certified by a registered civil
engineer or architect that the standards of Section
8.35.300(c)(2)(A) and (B) are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain

and substantial improvements of structures with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, and which are
subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs
for meeting this requirement must meet the following
minimum criteria:
(A) For non-engineered openings:
1. Have a minimum of two
openings on different sides having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
2. The bottom of all openings

below grade parking areas, see FEMA Technical
Bulletin TB-6.
(B) Detached garages and accessory
structures.
1. “Accessory structures” used
solely for parking (two car detached garages or smaller)
or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in
Section 8.35.050, may be constructed such that its floor
is below the base flood elevation (BFE), provided the
structure is designed and constructed in accordance
with the following requirements:
a. Use of the accessory
structure must be limited to parking or limited storage;
b. The portions of the
accessory structure located below the BFE must be
built using flood-resistant materials;
c. The accessory structure
must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse and lateral movement;
d. Any mechanical and
utility equipment in the accessory structure must be
elevated or flood-proofed to or above the BFE;
e. The accessory structure
must comply with floodplain encroachment provisions
in Section 8.35.350; and
f. The accessory structure
must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of
floodwaters in accordance with Section 8.35.300(c)(3).
2. Detached garages and
accessory structures not meeting the above standards
must be constructed in accordance with all applicable
standards in Section 8.35.300.
(6) Crawlspace construction. This
subsection applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to
two feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space
construction in accordance with the requirements listed
below will not be considered basements.
(A) The building must be designed and
adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not
allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five
feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a
qualified design professional, such as a registered
architect or professional engineer;
(B) The crawl space is an enclosed area
below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that
equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance
on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93;
(C) Crawl space construction is not
permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations
that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required
in V zones;
(D) Portions of the building below the
BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to
flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building,
but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that
extend below the BFE; and
(E) Any building utility systems within
the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or
designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the system components during flood
conditions.
(F) Requirements for all below-grade
crawl space construction, in addition to the above
requirements, to include the following:
1. The interior grade of a crawl
space below the BFE must not be more than two feet
below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown
as in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01;
2. The height of the below-grade
crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the
ALP S-6
Floodplain Management Regulations 41
crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation
wall must not exceed four feet (shown as L in figure 3
of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any point;
3. There must be an adequate
drainage system that removes floodwaters from the
interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable
period of time after a flood event, not to exceed 72
hours; and
4. The velocity of floodwaters at
the site should not exceed five feet per second for any
crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet per
second, other foundation types should be used.

(3) Meet the permit requirements of Section
8.35.220 and the elevation and anchoring requirements
for manufactured homes in Section 8.35.330(a).
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.350 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the
following provisions apply:
(a) Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no
new construction, substantial development, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one foot at any point within the City.
(b) Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the
City shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other
development, unless certification by a registered civil
engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed
encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
(c) If Section 8.35.350(a) and (b) are satisfied, all
new construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development shall comply with all other
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
Subchapter.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.360 Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas.
(a) The Floodplain Administrator shall review
permits for proposed construction of other development
to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area.
(b) Permits shall be reviewed to determine that
the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably
safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in
making this determination include, but are not limited
to:
(1) The type and quality of soils;
(2) Evidence of ground water or surface
water problems;
ALP S-6
Floodplain Management Regulations 43
(3) Depth and quality of any fill;
(4) Overall slope of the site; and
(5) Weight that any proposed development
will impose on the slope.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.370 Flood-related erosion-prone areas.
(a) The Floodplain Administrator shall require
permits for proposed construction and other
development within all flood-related erosion-prone
areas known to the community.
(b) Permit applications shall be reviewed to
determine whether the proposed site alterations and
improvements will be reasonably safe from
flood-related erosion, and will not cause flood-related
erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing
hazard.
(c) If a proposed improvement is found to be in
the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the
erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or
adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid
aggravating the existing erosion hazard.
(d) Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map, a setback is required for all new development
from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of
water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural
vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be
designated according to the flood-related erosion
hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated
“useful life” of structures, and depending upon the
geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic
characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for
suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural,
forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas,
and for other activities using temporary and portable
structures only.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
VARIANCE PROCEDURE
8.35.500 Nature of variances.
(a) The issuance of a variance is for floodplain
management purposes only. Insurance premium rates
are determined by statute according to actuarial risk
and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
(b) The variance criteria set forth in this
Subchapter are based on the general principle of zoning
law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are
not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for
a parcel of property with physical characteristics so
unusual that complying with the requirements of this
Chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the
applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not
be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic
must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.
(c) The City Council shall help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and
the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built
below flood level are so serious that variances from the
flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can
only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this Subchapter are
more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must
be met before a variance can be properly granted. The
criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a variance are more
appropriate.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.510 Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new
construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development to be erected on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing that the
ALP S-6
44 Canyon Lake - Building and Construction
procedures of Sections 8.35.300 through 8.35.370 and
this Subchapter have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in
Section 8.35.050) upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as an historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any
mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the “minimum
necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief
with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of
this Chapter. For example, in the case of variances to
an elevation requirement, this means the City Council
need not grant permission for the applicant to build at
grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant
proposes, but only to that elevation which the City
Council believes will both provide relief and preserve
the integrity of the local ordinance.
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted
shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct
a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage,
and
(2) Such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. It is
recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office
of the Riverside County Recorder and shall be recorded
in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.
(f) The Floodplain Administrator will maintain
a record of all variance actions, including justification
for their issuance, and report such variances issued in
its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. 153, passed 9-17-2014)
8.35.520 Appeal Board.
(a) In passing upon requests for variances, the
City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this Chapter, and the:
(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto
other lands to the injury of others;
(2) Danger of life and property due to
flooding or erosion damage;
(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility
and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the existing individual owner and future
owners of the property;
(4) Importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community;
(5) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront
location, where applicable;
(6) Availability of alternative locations for
the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or
erosion damage;
(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with
existing and anticipated development;
(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
(9) Safety of access to the property in time
of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate
of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters
expected at the site; and
ALP S-6
Floodplain Management Regulations 45
(11) Costs of providing governmental
services during and after flood conditions, including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and
streets and bridges.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon a:
(1) Showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) Determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional “hardship” to the
applicant; and
(3) Determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary
public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety
and nuisance”), cause “fraud and victimization” of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) Variances may be issued for new
construction, substantial improvement, and other
proposed new development necessary for the conduct
of a functionally dependent use provided that the
provisions of Section 8.35.520(a) through (d) are
satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and does not result in additional
threats to public safety and does not create a public
nuisance.
(d) Upon consideration of the factors of Section
8.35.510(a) and the purposes of this Chapter, the City
Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this Chapter.

APPENDIX
ALLUVIAL FAN ADVISORY
1. Hazards of Alluvial Fan Development.
Alluvial fans present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment, slope, and
topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection.
Active alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and
erosion. As a result, any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards.
The technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris flows for alluvial fans is
still in the early development stage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has formulated a
mapping procedure for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan zones
to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain regulation, referred to as the FEMA alluvial fan
methodology.
An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria:
a. Flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex;
b. Abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its competence
to carry material eroded from a steeper, upstream source area; and
c. An environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope, and topography creates an
ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk.
Inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans.
It is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in
the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Counter to active alluvial fan flooding hazards, an inactive alluvial fan
flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths. However, areas of inactive alluvial fan
flooding, as with active alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion, but to a
degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainly.
An alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding hazards. The
hazards may vary spatially or vary at the same location, contingent on the level of flow discharge. Spatially,
for example, upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood flow to active areas at the distal
part of the alluvial fan. Hazards may vary at the same location, for example, with a flow path that may be stable
for lower flows, but become unstable at higher flows.
More detailed information can be found at FEMA’s website: “Guidelines for Determining Flood Hazards on
Alluvial Fans” at http:// www. fema.gov/fhm/ft_afgd2. shtm# 1.

ALP S-6
48 Canyon Lake - Building and Construction
2. Alluvial Fans and LOMRs.
The NFIP does not allow for the removal of land from the floodplain based on the placement of fill (LOMR-F)
in alluvial fan flood hazard areas. The NFIP will credit a major structural flood control project, through the
LOMR process, that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the protected area. Details about
map revisions for alluvial fan areas can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations at Title 44, Part 65.13.
3. Alluvial Fan Task Force.
As stated in AB 2141 (Longville, Chapter 878, Statutes of 2004), the State of California Department of Water
Resources will convene an Alluvial Fan Task Force (AFTF). The AFTF will produce an alluvial fan model
ordinance for local communities and a recommendations report to the legislature. As of March 2006, the model
ordinance and report are projected to be completed by 2007.

processed and used to make other or new products.
9.01.030 Development Projects.
On or after September 1, 1994, the development
projects which have not yet obtained a building permit
are required to include recycling areas as set out in this
Chapter.
9.01.040 Costs/Fees.
All costs associated with designing or adding
recycling space to new or existing development
projects shall be the responsibility of the developer.
The City shall by resolution establish fees for review of
the recycling plan.
9.01.050 Recycling Plan.
Before issuance of any building permit and as part
of a site plan or conditional use permit, any
development project shall prepare and submit to the
City Planner, and have approved by him/her, a
recycling plan for a recycling area which meets the
following requirements:
3
4 Canyon Lake - Planning and Zoning
(a) The area shall be designed to be compatible
with nearby structures and with the existing topography
and vegetation, in accordance with existing standards,
and its location shall be shown on the site plan.
(b) The design, fencing and construction of
recycling areas shall adequately screen and secure the
recyclable materials placed there.
(c) The design, construction, and location of
recycling areas shall not be in conflict with any
applicable federal, state or local laws relating to fire,
building, access, transportation, circulation or safety.
(d) Recycling areas or bins or containers shall
provide protection against adverse environmental
conditions, such as rain, which might render the
collected material unmarketable.
(e) Driveways and/or travel aisles, at a minimum,
shall conform to local building code requirements for
waste collection access and clearance. In the absence of
such building code requirements, unobstructed access
shall be provided for collection vehicles and personnel.
(f) A sign clearly identifying the recyclable
collection and loading area shall be posted in the area,
and the materials accepted there shall be posted
adjacent to all points of direct access to the recycling
areas. Signage shall also state that only the specific
recyclable materials for which bins are provided by the
handler shall be placed in those bins. Signage shall
conform to local signage code requirements.
(g) Developments and transportation corridors
adjacent to recycling areas shall be adequately
protected from adverse impacts such as noise, odor,
vectors, or glare through measures including, but not
limited to, screening, maintaining adequate separation,
fencing, and landscaping.
(h) Recycling areas shall be located so they are
at least as convenient for those persons who deposit,
collect and load the recyclable materials as the location
where solid waste is collected and loaded. Whenever
feasible, areas for collecting and loading recyclable
materials shall be adjacent to the solid waste collection
areas.
(I) On-going maintenance and clean up of the
interior of each recycling and solid waste area are the
responsibility of the property owner. A maintenance
and clean-up area also may be provided within the
enclosure.
(j) The areas shall provide adequate space for
the separation and holding of recyclable materials.
(k) Other requirements specific or appropriate to
that development project as determined by the City
Planner.
9.01.060 Waivers.
(a) In order to meet these requirements, an
existing development may use one parking space,
landscaped areas or private open spaces for the location
of the recycling containers, if as part of the recycling
plan the Planning Director determines that the loss of
the parking, landscaping area or open space areas will
not have a significant negative effect on the need for
such areas or the aesthetics of the development.
(b) A parking space that has been converted to a
recycling container area must be marked for recycling
and adequately barricaded to prevent use as a parking
space.
9.01.070 Enforcement.
(a) Violation or failure to comply with any of the
provisions of this Chapter shall constitute grounds for
refusal of a building permit.
(b) Violation or failure to comply with

The purpose of the PAR is to advise prospective
applicants of current City standards and requirements;
to assess whether a proposal is consistent with such
standards before the applicant has expended sums of
money; make applicants familiar with requirements and
thus potentially shorten the processing time for
applications; and encourage designs which are sensitive
to the City's environmental and development priorities.
The PAR is an optional process which is not required
of an applicant. The PAR letter is NOT a development
entitlement in any way.

CHAPTER 9.06: INDOOR MARIJUANA CULTIVATION
Section
9.06.010 Purpose and intent.
9.06.020 Definitions.
9.06.030 Outdoor cultivation.
9.06.040 Cultivation of marijuana only for
personal use; regulations for

9.06.070 Penalties not exclusive; violation
constitutes a crime.
9.06.080 Sunset clause.
9.06.090 Prohibition on possession and
smoking of marijuana in City
buildings.
9.06.010 Purpose and intent.
The City Council finds as follows:
(a) Purpose. The purpose and intent of this
Chapter is to regulate the cultivation of marijuana in a
manner that protects the health, safety and welfare of
the community consistent with Proposition 64, also
known as the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of
Marijuana Act ("AUMA"). This Chapter is not
intended to interfere with a patient’s right to medical
marijuana, as provided for in California Health &
Safety Code Section 11362.5, nor does it criminalize
medical marijuana possession or cultivation by
specifically defined classifications of persons, pursuant
to state law. This Chapter is not intended to give any
person unfettered legal authority to grow marijuana; it
is intended simply to impose zoning restrictions on the
personal indoor cultivation of marijuana permitted
under AUMA, when it is authorized by California state
law for medical or other lawful purposes under the state
law.
(b) Applicability. As set out in Canyon Lake
Municipal Code Chapter 9.03, and authorized by AB
243 (Section 11362.777 of the Health & Safety Code),
marijuana cultivation, as defined in Section 17.114.02,
remains prohibited in all zones and districts of the City
of Canyon Lake until and unless AUMA is passed at
the November 8, 2016, statewide general election.
Upon the passage of AUMA at that election, the
cultivation of non-medical marijuana in the City shall
be controlled and regulated by the provisions of this
Chapter, which is an uncodified portion of the Zoning
Code.
(c) Non-conflicting enactment. No part of this
Chapter shall be deemed to conflict with federal law as
contained in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.
§§ 800 et seq., nor to otherwise permit any activity that
is prohibited under that Act or any other local, state or
federal law, statute, rule or regulation.

present written evidence that any and all other persons,

The purpose of this Chapter is to provide
regulations for the development of areas in the City
that, because of their topography, require special
consideration to ensure that they are developed in a
way that substantially maintains their natural character
and environmental and aesthetic values to implement
the general plan, and to provide for the safety, health,
and welfare of the public by:
(a) Providing guidelines and standards for
development in visually sensitive hillside areas to
minimize the adverse impacts of grading and to
promote the following goals and objectives of the
general plan:
(1) Open Space Goal OS-1: Maintain an
open space system that conserves remaining natural
resources, enhances aesthetic values, and promotes the
health, safety and general welfare;
(2) Open Space Policy OSP-2: Cooperate
with regional and subregional planning agencies in
matters of mutual open space concerns;
(3) Open Space Strategy OSS-6: Require
sensitive ecological areas, steep slopes, and special
land form features to be preserved as open space;
(b) To preserve and enhance the visual and
aesthetic quality of hillsides for the surrounding
community;
(c) To encourage the characteristics and qualities
that promote a “sense of place” within a hillside
setting;
(d) Maintaining an environment consistent with
existing vegetation, wildlife, soils, geology, slopes, and
drainage patterns, and to preserve natural topography
and scenic character, including canyons, creeks, knolls,
rock outcrops, and ridgelines whenever feasible;
(e) Encouraging development that is limited to
the more gently sloping portions of the site;
(f) Encouraging developments that preserve
desirable existing features of land (e.g., natural
appearing slopes, significant ridgelines, natural
vegetation, viewsheds, topographic features);
(g) Limiting the impact of cut and fill slopes on
adjacent developed and undeveloped properties;
(h) Preserving the regional view corridor located
along Railroad Canyon Road and the aesthetics of the
region which further are preserved by similar
ordinances, policies and practices in surrounding cities;
and
(i) Preserving the community's existing natural
significant ridgelines visible from Canyon Lake.

9.15.20 Definitions.
For the purposes of this Chapter, the following
definitions shall apply:
(a) “Clearing” means the removal of vegetation
(grass, brush, trees, and similar plant types) by
mechanical means (also known as brushing and/or
grubbing).
(b) “Cluster development” is a concept where
structures are grouped on certain portions of a site,
frequently of different shapes and sizes, surrounded by
large expanses of open space.
(c) “Contour” is a line drawn on a plan that
connects points of equal elevation.
(d) “Contour grading” means a grading concept
designed to result in earth forms that resemble natural
terrain characteristics. Horizontal and vertical curve
variations are often used for slope banks.
(e) “Conventional grading” is a grading concept
that results in simple, straight forward cut and fill lines
and even planed slopes. This is the most basic type of
grading often resulting in an “engineered or man-made”
appearance attributable to a lack of curvilinear or
natural-appearing shapes.
(f) “Cut” means the mechanical removal of earth
material.
(g) “Fill” means a deposit of earth material
placed by artificial means.
(h) “Finished grade” means the final elevation of
the ground surface after development, that is in
conformance with the approved plan.
(i) “Grading” means to bring an existing surface
to a designed form by excavating, filling, or
landforming operations in excess of 50 cubic yards.
(j) “Hillside” or “Hillside areas” refers to those
portions of land displaying slopes, ridgelines, hills,
knolls, canyons or similar topographic features with a
slope (as defined herein) of 25% or greater and are
identified on the Hillside Overlay and Significant
Ridgeline Map.
(k) “Hillside Overlay and Significant Ridgeline
Map” is an exhibit which is incorporated herein by
reference and attached to Ordinance No. 112, passed
March 4, 2009 and which shall be maintained on file in
the Planning Department, showing the areas subject to
this Chapter.
(l) “Landform grading” is a grading method that
replicates the irregular shapes of natural slopes.
Landform graded slopes are characterized by
continuous series of concave and convex forms
interspersed with mounds that blend into profiles,
nonlinearity in plan view, varying slope gradients, and
significant transition zones, between man-made and
natural slopes.
(m) “Minimal grading” is a grading concept
designed to minimize excavation and filling. Allows
the movement of earth for projects (e.g., as individual
building foundations, driveways, local roads, and utility
excavation). The concept is associated with roads
conforming closely to natural contours and with
structures being built on natural terrain.
(n) “Pad” is a level area created by grading to
accommodate development.
(o) “Plot plan” is an application filed with the
Planning Division, including all information required
by forms available at the Planning Division and Section
18.30 of Ordinance 348 of the City of Canyon Lake.
(p) “Project” means a project which is subject to
this Chapter, includes subdivisions, permits, uses,
structures, specific plans, master development plans,
conditional use permits and associated plot plans for
development review except as specifically exempted by
Section 9.15.040.
(q) “Significant ridgeline(s)” means natural
ridgeline(s) that are generally within or surrounding the
City of Canyon Lake that are visible from Canyon
ALP S-3
Hillside and Ridgeline Development 15
Lake or Railroad Canyon Road that form part of the
skyline or are seen as a distinct edge. All significant
ridgelines are identified within the Hillside Overlay and
Significant Ridgeline Map and are included with
Ordinance No. 112, passed March 4, 2009.
(r) “Slope” is an inclined ground surface, the
inclination of which is expressed as a ratio of the
vertical distance (rise), or change in elevation, to the
horizontal distance (run). The percent of a given slope
is determined by dividing the rise by the run, multiplied
by 100.
Change in Elevation (rise)
Horizontal Distance (run)
(s) “Slope ratio” is the relationship of a slope's
horizontal length to vertical height, with the height
specified as one (e.g. 2:1).
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.030 Applicability.

9.15.060 Hillside development standards.
The hillside development standards are intended
to illustrate and amplify the appropriate development
concepts for hillside areas. The standards are intended
to encourage flexibility and creativity to design projects
which exceed the standards in order to respect the
natural character of each hillside. The following are
minimum standards and shall apply to hillside or
hillside area as defined in Section 9.15.020.
(a) Hillside Slope Categories. The following
descriptions serve as general standards for hillside
slope categories to ensure that development will
compliment the overall character of the landform.
[Table begins on following page]
ALP S-3
18 Canyon Lake - Planning and Zoning
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
% Natural Slope
Category
Standards
Up to 25% This is not considered a hillside condition and is not subject to this Chapter.
25% up to 50% This is a hillside condition and is subject to this Chapter. Development within
this slope category shall minimize impacts to grading, vegetation removal, safety
and environmental and aesthetic impacts. Impact of access and roadways shall
be minimized by following natural contours or using grade separations.
Structures shall blend with the natural landform through their shape, material,
and color. Special hillside design techniques are required, which may include the
use of larger lots, variable setbacks, and variable building structural techniques
and clustering. Padded building sites may be considered in some instances.
Where this occurs, the City may consider padded building sites adjacent to
special features when it is found that grading of padded building sites will create
a better relationship between the special feature(s) and the building sites.
35% up to 50% In addition to the requirements of the above slope category, projects with an
average slope in excess of 35% may not exceed 50% of the maximum allowable
density as identified within the General Plan.
50% and over This is an excessive slope condition and development is prohibited.
(b) Site Design.
(1) Grading shall not take place on natural
slopes that exceed 50%.
(2) Driveway grades above 14% may only
be considered when driveways are aligned with the
natural contours of the land, are necessary to achieve
effective site design, and safety considerations are met
to the satisfaction of the Building Official, City
Engineer, and the Fire Department. Proper design
considerations shall be employed, including the use of
vertical curves. On driveways that may be approved
with a slope greater than 14%, a coarse, all-weather
paving material, or grooves for traction, shall be
incorporated into the construction.
(3) Roadways shall conform to the natural
landform. Significant alterations to the physical and
visual character of a hillside shall be avoided by
eliminating large notches in ridgelines and wide
straight alignments. Modified or reduced width road
sections and split sections shall be considered in the
layout of hillside streets to reduce grading and cuts in
topography while allowing access for fire trucks and
other emergency vehicles.
(4) Slopes in excess of 2:1 shall not be
allowed and slopes shall not exceed 30 feet in height
between terraces or benches.
(5) Fill slopes shall not be placed
perpendicular across a canyon. Straight line cut-off fill
slopes shall not be made to appear like a dam. The
terminus of the fill shall, instead, be concave in shape
to restore the canyon appearance. This concave
configuration shall be in combination with the use of
substantially flatter slope ratios (4:1, 3.5:1, 3:1) at or
near the center of this indentation. Symmetrical or
unsymmetrical concave configurations shall be used
depending upon the adjoining or underlying
topographic characteristics.
ALP S-3
Hillside and Ridgeline Development 19
(6) Grading shall be phased so that prompt
renegotiation or construction will control erosion.
Where possible, only those areas that will be built on,
resurfaced, or landscaped within the next 120 days
shall be disturbed. Top soil shall be stockpiled during
rough grading and used on pads or revegetated habitat
areas, upon the recommendation of the soils engineer.
A 100% grading bond shall be submitted to the City to
ensure erosion control is in place throughout all phases
and stages of the grading project, subject to the
approval of the City Building Official.
(7) Applicable requirements of the City and
State shall be complied with in conjunction with a
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit prior to the issuance of a grading
permit, which may include, but is not limited to, an
Erosion Control Plan, Best Management Plan
(including Notice of Intent to be filed with the State
Water Resources Control Board) and Construction
Monitoring Program.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.070 Significant ridgelines.
(a) Structures. New structures shall not visually
impair significant ridgeline silhouettes as identified
within the Hillside Overlay and Significant Ridgeline
Map. Structures are not permitted closer to a significant
ridgeline than 50 feet measured vertically on a
cross-section or 100 feet horizontally on a topographic
map from the highest pad elevation, whichever is more
restrictive.
(b) Grading. Grading is prohibited within 50 feet
measured vertically on a cross-section or 100 feet
horizontally on a topographic map from the crest of a
ridgeline or significant ridgeline.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.080 Hillside grading guidelines.
The implementation of the Hillside Grading
Guidelines is essential to affect continued quality
community development. The City of Canyon Lake
desires to encourage planning, engineering, and
development that results in minimal site grading in
addressing the varying terrain and highly visible
hillside areas. This can be accomplished by following
the natural contours as much as possible. From large
scale subdivision design to individual lot grading plans,
graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to
blend with the existing terrain. Significant natural
vegetation should be retained and incorporated into
projects whenever possible.
The guidelines shall apply unless specifically
modified by the approving authority and findings are
made that the modification is consistent with the
findings listed in Subsection (k) hereof.
(a) Grading must minimize the disturbance to the
natural landform, not destroy visual quality and
community character, nor create conditions that may
result in landslides, flooding, or erosion.
(b) No grading shall take place in known or
suspected hazardous areas as determined by the City
without a geological survey and/or other data and tests
as requested by the City.
(c) Projects located in hillside areas shall
incorporate clustering, varying setbacks, multiple
orientations, and other site planning techniques to
preserve open spaces, protect natural features, and offer
views to residents.
(d) Transitioning Slopes. Minimal radius
rounding at edges of cut and fill slopes is not
acceptable. Proper transitioning from manufactured
slopes to natural slopes shall be achieved gradually and
naturally using radii or irregular curvilinear shapes that
will blend into the adjoining topography tangentially
and not create abrupt changes.
(e) Good grading design must be exercised for
safety as well as aesthetics and should incorporate the
following measures:
(1) Utilization of landform or contour
measures to produce cut-and-fill slopes compatible
with existing land character. Continuous unbroken
slope surfaces that are visible from offsite are
discouraged. Linear or straight slopes shall not
ALP S-3
20 Canyon Lake - Planning and Zoning
exceed 100-feet in distance before next rounded
contoured edge. Edges and exposed tops and toes of
slopes shall be rounded with a minimum five-foot
radius where there are linear slopes up to 50 feet in
length and ten-foot radius where linear slopes are
greater than 50 feet. The parallel planes of adjacent
linear slopes shall be offset by minimum distance of
ten-foot measured perpendicular to the planes.
(2) Grading slopes contoured by varying
slope increments and undulating banks vertically and
horizontally.
(3) Varied cut-and-fill banks and drainage
terrace spacing to alleviate monotony and to allow
informal landscaping.
(4) Berms at top of slopes and other
locations used to screen, vary profile, and ensure
drainage away from slopes.
(5) Varied pad levels to avoid appearance of
monotonous slope banks and flat level lots.
(f) Minimal Grading. This is typically used for
large lot single-family homes, custom homes with
variable foundations that conform to the existing slopes
and other uses such as golf courses that utilize the least
amount of grading in order to get the facility and
structures built, but is also acceptable for commercial
uses. This technique embraces the following concepts:
(1) Grading should be limited to individual
flat graded pad areas for residential building sites.
Grading should be limited to only the required building
areas and adjacent outdoor amenities in steep hillside
areas.
(2) Foundation systems that require little or
no grading are encouraged, forcing the architecture to
conform to the land rather than the land to conform to
the dwelling.
(3) Roadways, driveways, and individual
building pads should be designed to conform with
contours and to attempt to daylight in the center of the
road or building pad to ensure a minimum cut and fill
situation.
(g) All manufactured cut and fill slopes
exceeding ten-feet in height which will be either
exposed to permanent public view or are adjacent to
environmentally sensitive areas, should be designed
with features characteristic of natural slopes where
physically feasible so that their ultimate appearance
will resemble a natural slope. This will include slopes
along streets and highways, slopes adjacent to parks,
schools, or open spaces and other public facilities and
other prominent and visible slopes.
(h) Clustering of development is encouraged
within the allowable density identified in the General
Plan. This is particularly important in environmentally
sensitive areas in order to reduce the potential for fire
hazard, erosion and excess runoff, and to preserve
existing natural features and open space.
(I) In the planning, design, and development of
public utilities and infrastructure, every reasonable
effort shall be made to minimize grading impacts and
harmonize with natural contours and character of the
landform design applied.
(j) The City Council or its designee may modify
or waive any of the hillside/grading guidelines when an
improved design will result or where it can be
demonstrated that imposing hillside grading guidelines
would either render a parcel of land unbuildable, create
a loss of all its reasonable economic use, or place an
undue restriction on the improvement of the property,
the City Council may allow development consistent
with the General Plan, only when all of the following
findings can be made:
(1) The site is physically suitable for the
design and siting of the proposed development. The
proposed development will result in minimum
disturbance of sensitive areas;
(2) The grading proposed in connection with
the development will not result in soil erosion, silting
of lower slopes, flooding, severe scarring or any other
geological instability or fire hazard which
ALP S-3
Hillside and Ridgeline Development 21
would affect health, safety and general welfare as
determined by the City Engineer and all other
requirements of applicable law and regulation are met;
(3) The proposed development retains the
natural character and visual quality of the site and the
aesthetic qualities of the area; and
(4) The proposed development is in
conformance with the qualitative development
standards and guidelines as established in this Chapter
and is in conformance with the goals, objectives, and
policies of the General Plan.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.090 Grading, grubbing and scarring control.
No clearing or grubbing shall be allowed except in
conjunction with a grading permit approved pursuant to
the provisions of this Chapter.
(a) No permits shall be issued for any grading,
grubbing, building or structure except after compliance
with this Chapter.
(b) No dirt or rock shall be allowed to be used for
fill except in those locations approved by the grading
plan. Excess dirt or rock shall be carried to a disposal
area designated on the grading plan or to an approved
off-site location.
(Ord. 112, passed 3-4-2009)
9.15.100 Hillside and ridgeline development
permit procedures.
(a) Permit Required. Except as exempted in this
Chapter, no grading or construction within 100
horizontal feet or 50 vertical feet of the crest of a
Significant Ridgeline, as shown on the Hillside and
Significant Ridgeline Map shall be allowed.
(b) Review Authority. The City Planner in
consultation with the Building Official and City
Engineer shall review Hillside and Ridgeline
Development Permit Applications, make
determinations of completeness, and render decisions
on such permits, unless a Hillside and Ridgeline

contained in such kennel shall be exempt from the
requirements of individual license tags. The kennel
license fees, and late fees if an application for a license
is made more than 30 days after the date such license is
required, shall be set by resolution of the City Council.
(c) Application for a kennel or cattery license

messages when such caretaker is absent from the
subject kennel or cattery and consent to enter the

be submitted to the Animal Control Officer at the time
the application for the kennel or cattery license is
submitted.

the Animal Control Officer or the City Planning
Director may, in their respective discretion, limit the
numbers of dogs or cats over the age of four months
which are kept or maintained in any kennel or cattery,

considered or at such time as an application for renewal
of a kennel or cattery license is considered.

cattery license, each owner and operator of a kennel or
cattery shall agree to allow such entry and inspection
and such agreement shall be made a part of the license
application. Such inspections shall be made during
reasonable hours at times when the owner or operator
of the kennel or cattery is present on the kennel or
cattery premises, and with such frequency as the
Animal Control Officer shall deem appropriate, and
such inspections may, at the discretion of the Animal
Control Officer, be made without prior notice to the
owner or operator of the subject kennel or cattery.
Willful refusal on the part of a kennel or cattery owner
or operator to allow such inspection shall be grounds
for summary denial of an application for a kennel or
cattery license or for summary suspension or
revocation of a kennel or cattery license.
(b) A nonprofit corporation formed pursuant to
the provisions of the California Corporations Code
commencing with Section 10400, for the prevention of

kennel or cattery license.
The Animal Control Officer may, in his or her
discretion, deny any application for a kennel or cattery
license whether such application is for an original
license or renewal of a license, and may suspend or
revoke any kennel or cattery license if he/she finds that
a kennel or cattery fails to meet any or all of the
standards for kennels and catteries in this Chapter or is
in violation of any law of the State or any provision of
this Code.
(a) Notice. When such denial, suspension or
revocation occurs, the Animal Control Officer shall
prepare a written notice of such denial, suspension or
revocation which shall contain a brief statement of the
reason or reasons for such denial, suspension or
revocation. The Animal Control Officer shall serve
such notice upon the applicant or licensee by
handdelivery or by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested. Denial, suspension or
revocation shall be effective 30 days after service of
such notice. Where an application for a kennel or
cattery license is denied or where a kennel or cattery
license issue pursuant to this Chapter is revoked, no
application for a new license for such kennel or cattery
shall be considered for a period of one year from the
effective date of such denial or revocation; provided,
however, that the good cause shown the City Council
may direct that there be a lesser period of time before
such application will be considered.
(b) Appeal. Within 15 days after notice of such
denial, suspension or revocation, any person whose
application has been denied or whose license has been
suspended or revoked, may appeal such denial,
suspension or revocation by filing with the City Clerk
or his or her deputy a written notice of appeal briefly
setting forth the reasons why the appellant alleges such
action is improper. The appeal shall be conducted
under the provisions of Section 10.01.020; provided,
however, that during any pending appeal the Animal
Control Officer may take such action as he or she
deems appropriate under this Code or any other
provision of law respecting the subject kennel or
cattery, including, but not limited to, the abatement of
public nuisances, inspection of the kennel or cattery
premises, or the prosecution of any violation of this
Chapter or any other provision of law not related to the
failure of the subject kennel or cattery to be currently
and otherwise validly licensed.

determines that an epidemic of rabies exists or may be
threatened, the Animal Control Officer shall have the

pre-seizure hearing.
At least five days prior to the impoundment of any
dog or cat pursuant to this Chapter, written notice shall
be given by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, to the owner’s last known address, of the

justified.
(a) The notice shall include all of the following
information:
(1) The name, business address, and

and treating any animal properly seized under this
Section is a lien on the animal; that any animal seized
shall not be returned to the owner until such charges
are paid, and that failure to request or to attend a

within two (2) days, excluding weekends and holidays,
after receipt of the request for such hearing. The
hearing shall be informal and shall not be limited by the
technical rules of evidence, but evidence shall be of the
type upon which reasonable people rely.
(e) Failure of the owner to request or to attend a
scheduled hearing shall result in a forfeiture of any
right to a preseizure hearing or right to challenge his or
her liability for costs incurred pursuant to this Chapter.
(f) The owner shall produce the animal at the
time of the hearing unless, prior to the hearing, the
owner has made arrangements for the Animal Control
Officer to view the animal, or unless the owner can
provide verification that the animal has been humanely
destroyed. Any person who willfully fails to produce
the animal or provide appropriate verification is guilty
of a violation of this Code.

affirm or deny the owner's or keeper's right to custody
of the animal and, if reasonable grounds are
established, may order the seizure or impoundment of
the animal for care and treatment.

Whenever the Animal Control Officer seizes or
impounds an animal based on a reasonable belief that

ascertainable after reasonable investigation, with the

a responsible person for the violation, the
administrative citation shall be mailed to the
responsible person by certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested. Simultaneously, the same

in serving the responsible person personally, or by

interest, and such posting shall be deemed effective

such offense may be charged as an infraction in the
discretion of the City Attorney or District Attorney.

The City Attorney is authorized to prosecute any other
civil or criminal remedies available in law or in equity
for violations of this Chapter, including, but not limited
to, seeking an order or warrant to confiscate
psychoactive bath salts or psychoactive herbal incense.
(b) Any person who violates this Chapter shall be
guilty of a separate offense for each day or part of a day
during which the violation is committed, continued, or
permitted.
(c) Alternatively, the City may assess an
administrative fine and penalty of $1,000 a day for all
violations of this Chapter based upon its finding of the
immediate and substantial harm to public health, safety,
and welfare by a violation of this Chapter. Such
enforcement shall be consistent with the requirements
for administrative citations.
(d) In addition to any other remedies, the City
may withhold or refuse to issue a business license to
any person or entity found to be in violation of this
Chapter or may revoke an existing business license as
set forth in Section 11.90.060.
(e) Violation of this Chapter also constitutes a
public nuisance. Because the use of synthetic drugs
has been documented to cause hallucinations, agitation,
psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal ideations,
and death, any violation of this Chapter presents a
grave and imminent danger not only to the person
consuming the synthetic drug, but also to the public at
large. If the Code Enforcement Officer, based on the
facts then known, determines that a violation of this
Chapter presents an imminent danger or hazard or is
imminently injurious to the public health or safety, then
that violation is punishable by the summary abatement
procedures set forth in Chapter 11.20 hereof.

license and owning or operating a business in the City
may use that business to provide, distribute, or sell any
synthetic drug or any substance claimed or represented
to be a synthetic drug. A violation of this Section by
the holder of a validly issued City business license,
shall constitute grounds for modification, suspension,
and/or revocation of said license in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Code.

Nothing in this Chapter shall preclude the City
from pursuing the remedies made applicable hereto
elsewhere in this Municipal Code or under State law,
including but not limited to, as applicable, denial or
revocation of certificates of occupancy and injunctive
relief. In any administrative or criminal proceeding
involving the abatement of a public nuisance, the City
shall also be entitled to recover its full reasonable costs
of abatement, including, but not limited to,
investigation, analysis, and prosecuting the
enforcement against the guilty party, upon submission
of proof of such cost by the City.

In addition to and in accordance with the
determination made and the authority granted by the
state under Vehicle Code Section 22660 to remove
abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative
vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the
Council makes the following findings and declarations:
(a) The accumulation and storage of abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof on private or public property, not including
highways, is found to create a condition tending to
reduce the value of private property, to promote blight
and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire
hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a
hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a
harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to
the health, safety and general welfare; and
(b) Therefore, the presence of an abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part
thereof on private or public property, not including
highways, except as expressly permitted in this
Chapter, constitutes a public nuisance which may be
abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter.

(b) If the owner of the land submits a sworn
written statement denying responsibility for the
presence of the vehicle on his or her land within such
ten day period, the statement shall be construed as a
request for a hearing which does not require his or her

(a) All hearings under this Chapter shall be held
before the City Council, which shall hear all facts and
testimony it deems pertinent. The facts and testimony
may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle,
or part thereof, and the circumstances concerning its
location on the private property or public property. The
City Council shall not be limited by the technical rules
of evidence. The owner of the land on which the
vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing
or present a written statement in time for consideration
at the hearing and deny responsibility for the presence
of the vehicle on the land with his or her reasons for the
denial.
(b) The City Council may impose such
conditions and take such other action as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this Chapter. It may delay the time for
removal of the vehicle, or part thereof, if, in its opinion,
the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the
public hearing, the City Council may find that a
vehicle, or part thereof, has been abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or is inoperative on private or public
property and by resolution order the same removed
from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of
as provided in this Chapter and determine the
administrative costs and the cost of removal to be
charged against the owner of the parcel of land on
which the vehicle, or part thereof, is located. The order
requiring removal shall include a description of the
vehicle, or part thereof, and the correct identification
number and license number of the vehicle, if available
at the site.
(c) If it is determined at the hearing that the
vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of
the land owner and that he or she has not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, the City Council shall not
assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle
against the property upon which the vehicle is located
or otherwise attempt to collect the costs from the land
