Division 18.01.02 Interpretation, Transitional Provisions, and Severability 
Page 2 


18.01.02.01 Interpretation 
A. 	Generally. As this UDC affects constitutionally protected rights, it has been written with an understanding of, and subject to, these rights, which are articulated in the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Colorado and interpreted by federal and state courts with jurisdiction in and over the City of Loveland. 
B. 	Relationship to Policy and Land Use Plans. It is the City Council’s intent that this UDC provide for implementation over time of the policies that are set out in the Comprehensive Plan, as well as any specific area, transportation, or facility plans that may be adopted prior or subsequent to the adoption of this UDC. However, neither this UDC nor any amendments thereto may be challenged on the basis of any alleged inconsistency or nonconformity with any planning document. 
C. 	Permits Issued in Conflict with UDC. Any permit issued in conflict with the provisions of this UDC shall be null and void and shall not be construed as waiving any provision of this UDC, unless such waiver is expressly authorized by variance or other comparable procedure set out herein. No oversight or dereliction of any office or employee of the City shall legalize, authorize, or excuse any violation of any provision of this UDC. No legal, vested, or equitable rights shall be acquired under any invalid zoning or building permit, certificate of occupancy, or license. 
D. 	Basic Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this UDC shall be regarded as the basic requirements for the protection of public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and welfare. This UDC shall be liberally interpreted in order to further its underlying purposes. 
E. 	Construction with Other Laws. Whenever any provision of this UDC or any provision of any other law, rule, contract, resolution, ordinance, or regulation of the City, County, state, or federal government contains certain standards covering the same subject matter, the interpretation that gives effect to all of the applicable laws controls. Generally, that means that the more restrictive requirements or higher standards control the decision. 
F. 	Signs; Substitution of Noncommercial Speech for Commercial Speech. Notwithstanding anything contained in this UDC to the contrary, any sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this UDC or otherwise lawfully existing with a commercial message may, at the option of the owner, contain a noncommercial message in lieu of a commercial message. The noncommercial message may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from commercial to noncommercial messages, or from one noncommercial message to another, as frequently as desired by the owner of the sign, provided that: 
1. 	
The sign is not a prohibited sign or sign-type; 

2. 	
The frequency of message changes does not exceed the maximum frequency established by this UDC for electronic message centers; and 

3. 	
The size, height, setback, and other dimensional criteria contained in this UDC have been satisfied, or the sign structure is legally nonconforming. 


G. 	Hyperlinks. This UDC may contain hyperlinks to referenced standards. The Director is authorized to update hyperlinks from time to time without further action by the City Council. The hyperlinks are provided for the convenience of the end-user, and City makes no representation as to whether hyperlinked materials that are hosted on domains that are outside of the City’s control are accurate or current. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.01.02.02 Effect on Pending Applications 
A. 	Generally. An application for approval of a site specific development plan, as well as the approval, conditional approval, or denial of approval of such plan, shall be governed only by the duly adopted laws and regulations in effect at the time the complete application is submitted. See C.R.S. § 24-68-102.5, Applications -Approval by Local Government. 
B. 	Immediate Public Health and Safety Exception. The City may adopt a new or amended ordinance or regulation, when necessary, for the immediate preservation of public health and safety, and may enforce such ordinance or regulation in relation to applications pending at the time such ordinance or regulation is adopted. See C.R.S. § 24-68­102.5, Applications - Approval by Local Government. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Page 3 


18.01.02.03 Effect on Approvals and Permits that Pre-Date the Effective Date 
A. 	Generally. Development that was approved by the City prior to the effective date of this UDC, but not completed as of the effective date, may be carried out within the scope of the development approval or permit, provided that the approval or permit is valid and has not lapsed. Work that is authorized by permits must be commenced during the period in which the permit is valid, and then diligently pursued to completion. 
B. 	Duration of Development Approvals. 
1. 	Development approvals and permits that are valid on the effective date, but for which no further action has been taken with respect to permitting, construction, or establishment of a land use are valid until the earlier of: 
a. 	
Their stated expiration date, which may be on the face of the permit or development approval, or within related documents such as development agreements or regulations in force on the date of the approval; or 

b. 	
One year after the date of approval of a general development plan (“GDP”) or preliminary development plan (“PDP”), if the next step in the planned unit development process is not initiated before the anniversary date of the approval or an extension is approved by the Director. 

c. 	
Three years after the date of approval of a site development plan (“SDP”), if no applications for related permits have been filed with the City before the third anniversary of the approval. 

d. 	
Three years after the date of approval of a special review permit, if the special review use has not been established by the third anniversary of the approval. 

e. 	
Three years after the effective date of this UDC for other approval types, except those set out in subsection B.2., below. 


2. 	
Approved final plats and approved final development plans do not have expiration dates. However, property that is subject to a final development plan for which rights have not been vested may be rezoned by the City if no action is taken with respect to permitting, construction, or establishment of a land use for a period of three years after the date of approval. 

3. 	
The Director may grant an extension of up to one year for the approvals and permits listed above for good cause shown, provided that a request for the extension is filed with the Director not less than 30 days prior to the expiration date of the approval or permit. 


C. 	Scope of Approvals. 
1. 	
This Section shall not be interpreted to confer rights upon an applicant that are not set out within the scope of a development approval or permit. For example, if building design standards are adopted after a site plan is approved, but before any other applications are filed, then they may be applied to subsequent building permits because they are outside of the scope of site plan approval. 

2. 	
The standards of this UDC apply to planned unit developments unless the Director finds that the approved planned unit development documents include standards addressing the same item, and the planned unit development approval is vested. 


D. 	Conditions of Prior Approvals or Permits. All conditions of development approvals or permits that were granted or issued prior to the effective date remain in force according to their own terms, regardless of the standards or requirements of this UDC. Conditions of approval may be modified or eliminated pursuant to Division 18.17.15, Administrative Variations, Design Flexibility, Reasonable Accommodations, Height Exceptions, and Variances, or upon periodic review if the condition of approval required periodic review. 
E. 	Effect of Termination of Approval. Approvals that terminate pursuant to this Section become void on the date of termination, and no further development approvals or permits may be issued in reliance upon them. No application for an extension or modification of an approval or permit will be accepted after termination of the approval or permit for which extension or modification is sought.

except as may be provided therein or by applicable state or federal law. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.01.02.05 Effect on Special Review Approvals 
A. 	Generally. Property that is subject to an approved special review that was submitted or approved prior to the effective date of this UDC may be developed in accordance with the approved special review plan. The approved special review plan shall be considered a site development plan for an adaptable use. 
B. 	Amendment to an Existing Special Review Plan. Minor amendments (administrative variations) complying with the thresholds in subsection D. of Section 18.17.15.01, Administrative Variations, shall be processed in accordance with a Track 1 Decision-Making Track. Major amendments that exceed the thresholds in subsection D. of Section 18.17.15.01, Administrative Variations, shall be processed as a new adaptable use. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.01.02.06 Effect on Flexible Overlay Zones 
A. 	Generally. Property that is subject to a Flexible Overlay Zone that was approved prior to the effective date of this UDC may be developed in accordance with the approved plan as provided in this Section. No new Flexible Overlay Zones shall be established. 
B. 	Minor Amendments. A flexible overlay plan may be amended administratively if the Director determines that the proposed amendment meets the criteria of this subsection. Where these criteria have been met, the amendment shall be considered minor and the Director shall have the authority to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed amendment: 
1. 	
The boundaries of the flexible overlay zone would not expand; 

2. 	
The amendment would not allow new uses; 

3. 	
The amendment would not allow a change in development density or intensity greater than 20 percent; 

4. 	
The amendment would not alter a condition approved by City Council; and 

5. 	
The amendment would not create material negative impacts on adjacent property owners or other owners of property within the Flexible Overlay Zone. 


C. 	Major Amendments. Amendments exceeding the thresholds in subsection B., above, shall require rezoning to an 
appropriate zone that is listed in Section 18.02.02.01, Zones Established. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.01.02.07 Effect on Existing Violations 
A. 	Generally. Any violation of the previous versions of the UDC or sections of the City of Loveland Municipal Code that were repealed and replaced upon adoption of this UDC shall be treated as follows: 
1. 	
If a violation occurred prior to the effective date and continued past the effective date, then the City may pursue remedies for each day of violation, based on the UDC or municipal code sections that were in effect on each day that the violation occurred. 

2. 	
If a violation occurred prior to the effective date, but the same activity is no longer a violation after the effective date, then the City may pursue remedies for each day of the violation, based on the UDC or municipal code sections that were in effect on each day prior to the effective date during which the violation occurred. 


B. 	Fines and Penalties. Payment of fines shall be required for any civil penalty assessed prior to the effective date (under the previous versions of the UDC or City of Loveland Municipal Code), even if the original violation is no longer considered a violation under this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.01.02.08 No Effect on Existing Easements, Covenants, or Agreements 
Page 5 

A. 	Generally. This UDC is not intended to abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, or any other agreement related to the use or development of land if the easement, covenant, or agreement pre-dates the effective date. 
B. 	No Effect on Private Restrictions. 
1. 	
Generally. The UDC does not change or override private restrictions on property. The UDC will be enforced on property that is subject to private restrictions in the same manner as other properties. 

2. 	
No Duty to Search for Private Restrictions. The City has no duty to search for the existence of private restrictions on property. In the review of applications pursuant to this UDC, the City will enforce only its own regulations and agreements to which it is a party or has an interest. 

3. 	
No Duty to Interpret Private Restrictions. 

a. 	
The City will not interpret or apply private restrictions unless: 

1. 	
It is a party to them; and 

2. 	
As a party, the County determines that interpretation is necessary. 



b. 	
When the City zones or rezones property or otherwise issues a development approval, such action shall not be considered an interpretation regarding existing private restrictions to which the City is not a party. 

c. 	
Parties to private covenants who seek permits or development approvals from the City that are inconsistent with their private covenants do so at their own risk that the covenants may be enforced by other private parties who may have standing to file suit. 



4. 	
No Duty to Enforce Private Restrictions. The City will not generally seek to enforce private restrictions. The City may become involved in the enforcement of private restrictions only if: 


a. 	The City is a party to or has an explicit right of enforcement set out in the restrictions; or the City Council or City Manager determines that enforcement is in the interest of the City as a whole; and 
b. The City finds that it is likely to have legal standing to enforce the private restrictions. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.01.02.09 Severability 
A. 	Generally. It is the legislative intent of the City Council that provisions of this UDC and subsequent amendments (unless otherwise set out in the adopting ordinance for said amendments) shall be severable in accordance with the provisions set out in this Section. 
B. 	Severability of UDC Provisions, Except Signs. If any chapter, division, section, subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of this UDC is held unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this UDC shall not be affected, and shall continue in full force and effect unless and until the City Council acts to modify the UDC or part thereof. If any application of this UDC to a particular building, use, structure, improvement, land, or water is adjudicated as unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not be applicable to any other building, use, structure, improvement, land, or water that is not specifically included in said judgment. 
C. 	Severability of UDC Provisions Regarding Signs. With respect to Division 18.04.08, Signs, the following severability provisions shall apply instead of those set out in Subsection B., above: 
1. 	
Generally. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause, provision, or portion of Division 18.04.08, Signs, or any other provision of this UDC that is related to signage (collectively “Sign Regulations”), is declared unconstitutional by judgment or decree of a court, then the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other Sign Regulation, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 

2. 	
Severability of Provisions Pertaining to Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements. It is the intent of the City Council to ensure that the sign types and sign elements that may be constitutionally prohibited by the Sign Regulations continue to be prohibited. Accordingly, without diminishing or limiting in any way the declarations of intent with respect to subsection C.1., above, if any Sign Regulation related to prohibited signs and sign elements is declared 


Page 6 

unconstitutional by judgment or decree of a court, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other Sign Regulation that pertains to prohibited signs or sign elements. 
3. 	Severability of Provisions if Adjudicated Stricken Due to a Content-Basis. If any Sign Regulation is declared unconstitutional by judgment or decree of a court on the basis that said Sign Regulation is content-based and does not survive strict scrutiny review, then it is the intent of the City Council that only that portion of the provision that is found to be unconstitutional be severed from this UDC, and if it is not possible for the court to strike only the portion of the provision that is found to be unconstitutionally content-based, then it is the intent of the City Council that all signs that would be subject to the stricken provision will instead be subject to the next surviving provision for a sign of comparable geometry and character that is more restrictive than the stricken provision in terms of sign area, and if the sign area is the same, sign height.

Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.02.02.03 Official Zoning Map Adopted 
A. 	Official Zoning Map Adopted. The boundaries of Zones and Overlay Zones are shown upon the map entitled “Official Zoning Map of the City of Loveland” (referred to hereinafter as “Zoning Map”) which is incorporated into and made part of this UDC by this reference. 
B. 	Force and Effect. The Zoning Map and all notations, references, and other information shown on it are a part of this UDC and have the same force and effect as this UDC. 
C. 	Status of Zoning Map. The Zoning Map that is on file at the Development Services Department shall control in the event of a conflict between the map that is on file and any other reproduction of said map, including but not limited to, maps that are made available electronically. 

D. 	Maintenance of Zoning Map. Amendments to the zoning district map shall be made administratively to implement all zone boundary changes approved by Ordinance by the City Council. Technical changes to the Zoning Map that are necessary to ensure that the Zoning Map accurately reflects zone boundaries previously approved by Ordinance of the City Council shall also be made administratively. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.02.02.04 Interpretation of Zoning Map 
A. 	Generally. The precise location of any zone boundary line shown on the Zoning Map shall be defined by the rules of this Section. 
B. 	Rezoning Ordinances. 
1. 	
Rezoning ordinances shall be promptly reflected on the Zoning Map. The boundaries of property that are specified in a rezoning ordinance are controlling, except as provided in this subsection. 

2. 	
Conflicts between the zone boundaries on the Zoning Map and the zoning for property provided by an adopted rezoning ordinance dated after the effective date of this UDC could result from administrative or scrivener’s errors. In the event of such conflict: 

a. 	
It is presumed that the adopted rezoning ordinance controls, and the Zoning Map shall be promptly corrected when the conflict is identified. The Director shall provide written notice of the correction to the owners of property that is the subject of a Zoning Map correction. 

b. 	
The presumption may be rebutted if it is obvious that the error is within the text of the rezoning ordinance, in that: 

1. 	
The rezoning affects property that was not the subject of the application for rezoning; or 

2. 	
The rezoning affects only a portion of the property that was the subject of the application, the application requested rezoning for the entire property, and the application was granted without conditions that restricted the extent of the rezoning. 





3. 	
Any conflict between the boundaries on the Zoning Map and a development approval granted before the effective date shall be resolved as follows: 

a. 	
If the Zoning Map conflicts with a rezoning ordinance adopted before the effective date, the Zoning Map boundaries control. However, if the rezoning ordinance was tied to a site specific development plan, then the Zoning Map designation shall not interfere with any vested rights created by the site specific development plan. 

b. 	
If the Zoning Map conflicts with an active planned unit development (“PUD”) ordinance that was adopted before the effective date, the PUD ordinance controls, unless there is record evidence to show that the Zoning Map was intended to adjust the boundaries of the PUD. 

c. 	
If the Zoning Map conflicts with an inactive PUD ordinance, or with the boundary of a completed PUD, then the Zoning Map controls. 

d. 	
If the Zoning Map conflicts with a development or annexation agreement, then the conflict shall be resolved according to the terms of the agreement. 




C. 	Identifiable Features. In the absence of a rezoning ordinance that specifies parcel boundaries, where zone boundary lines appear to follow identifiable features, their location shall be determined by applying the rules of this subsection in order from 1. to 5.: 
1. 	
Rights-of-Way. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, streets, alleys, railroad tracks, or utility lines shall be construed as following the centerline of the right-of-way. Where the location of the actual streets or alleys differs from the location of corresponding streets or alleys on the Zoning Map, the location of the actual streets or alleys controls. 

2. 	
Property Lines. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, lot lines or other property lines shown on the Zoning Map shall be construed as following such lines. 

3. 	
Toe or Top of Slope. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, the toe or the top of a steep slope, shall be construed as following the contour line of the toe or top of slope. 

4. 	
Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of streams, canals, or other watercourses shall be construed as following the channel centerline. In the event of a natural change in the location of such streams or other watercourses, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline. However, such movement shall not render existing development nonconforming. 

5. 	
Parallel to Features. Boundaries shown as separated from and parallel, or approximately parallel, to any of the features listed in paragraphs 1. through 4., above, shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances as are shown by the scale on the zoning map. 



D. 	Un-subdivided Land or No Identifiable Feature. In the absence of a rezoning ordinance that specifies parcel boundaries, on un-subdivided land, or where a district boundary follows no identifiable feature, the location of zone boundaries shall be determined by applying the following rules in sequential order until the boundaries are known: 
1. 	
Text Dimensions. The boundary shall be located by reference to dimensions shown in text on the zoning map, if any. 

2. 	
Map Scale. The boundary shall be located using the map scale appearing on the Zoning Map. 


E. 	
All Land Within City Limits Shall Be Zoned. It is the intent of the City Council that all land within the City be zoned. Accordingly, the Developing Resource Zone (“DR”) shall be applied to all land on the zoning map that is not the subject of one of the conflicts identified in subsection B.2. or B.3., above, and: 

1. 	
Within the corporate limits of the City; 

2. 	
Not within a right-of-way; and 



3. 
Not shown within the boundaries of a particular zone. Effective on: 11/20/2018 



18.02.02.05 Zoning of Annexed Land 
A. 	Generally. Zoning of annexed land or land in the process of annexation is an initial zoning. The standards and procedures that apply to zoning of annexed land are the same as those applied to a rezoning of property within the City limits. 
B. 	Timing of Adoption of Zoning Ordinance. An ordinance proposing zoning of a parcel or parcels to be annexed shall not be finally adopted by the City Council before the date of final adoption of the annexation ordinance, but the annexation ordinance may include the zoning ordinance for the annexed property. 
C. 	Compliance with State Law. All annexations to the City shall meet the requirements of C.R.S. § 31-12, et seq., shall 
be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be in compliance with Division 18.17.01, Annexation. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.02.03 Land Use by Zone 
18.02.03.01 Interpretation of Land Use by Zone Tables 
A. 	Generally. The tables set out in this Division describe which land uses are permitted “as-of-right,” permitted if certain conditions are met, permitted after notice and comment if certain conditions are met, permitted after public hearing if certain conditions are met, and not allowed in each zone. 
B. 	Legend. The following symbols are used in the tables in this Division: 
1. 	
“R” means “permitted as-of-right.” These uses are subject to administrative review for compliance with the general requirements of this UDC. 

2. 	
“L” means “limited use.” Limited uses are subject to administrative review for compliance with specific standards that pertain to the use, as well as the general requirements of this UDC. 

3. 	
“A” means “adaptable use.” Adaptable uses are subject to administrative review for compliance with specific standards that pertain to the use, the general standards for all adaptable uses, and the general requirements of this UDC. Adaptable uses do not require a public hearing, but do require a neighborhood meeting. 

4. 	
“C” means “conditional use.” Conditional uses are subject to public hearing review for compliance with specific standards that pertain to the use, the general standards for all conditional uses, and the general requirements of this UDC. 

5. 	
“-” means that the use is not allowed in the specified district. 



C. 	Multiple Uses. In instances where a proposed development will combine more than one listed use, except those developments that qualify as mixed-use, each listed shall be evaluated independently for compliance with applicable standards. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018

B. 	Conversion to an Adaptable Use. 
1. 	
Generally, in the event that a use standard for a Limited Use cannot be met, and the use standard does not represent a dimensional or numerical standard that can be processed through Section 18.17.15.01, Administrative Variations, the use may be treated (at the applicant’s option, subject to the exceptions of subsection B.2., below) as an Adaptable Use. Thereafter, it shall be processed in accordance with the Adaptable Use standards in Section 18.02.04.13, General Standards for Adaptable Uses, and the Adaptable Use procedures in Section 18.14.02.02, Decision-Making Tracks by Application Type, and the applicable use-specific standards from this Division shall be met to the extent practicable.

Division 18.02.07 Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone 
18.02.07.01 Purpose of Division 
A. 	Generally. The purpose of this Division is to establish standards within the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone. The regulations in this Division are intended to apply to specific areas of the City that recognize benefits and potentially adverse impacts that may occur within certain distances from an airport, and to provide regulations that both minimize these impacts and protect aircraft operations. 
B. 	Noise-Sensitive Uses. These regulations are intended to minimize exposure of residential and other noise-sensitive land uses from uncontrollable aircraft noise and high numbers of aircraft overflights; to minimize risks to public safety from potential aircraft accidents; to discourage traffic congestion within these areas by regulating land use densities; and to restrict incompatible land uses within the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone. 
C. 	Interagency Coordination. These regulations recognize the efforts of other agencies and show the City’s willingness 
to cooperate with these agencies in the administration of these regulations. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.02.07.02 Interpretation and Disclaimer 

A. 	Interpretation. In the event a lot is located within more than one noise contour, the entire lot shall be subject to the restrictions of the noise contour that most restricts development of the lot. This provision shall not be applied to prevent or discourage subdivision of a subject property to minimize encroachment into noise contours or to prevent straddling the boundary between noise contours. 
B. 	Disclaimer. The degree of protection provided by this Division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on planning, engineering and scientific methods of study, and in coordination with aviation agencies. This Division does not imply that areas outside of the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone will be totally free from aircraft hazards, and, therefore, shall not create a liability on the part of the City or any of its officers or employees for any damages resulting from reliance on this Division. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.02.07.03 Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone Boundaries 
A. 	Generally. 
1. 	
The boundaries of the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone and its noise contours, are based in part upon predictions of day to day noise levels that are perceptible at ground level. These predictions are based upon acoustical modeling techniques that are accepted as accurate and reliable by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and by hundreds of airport operators and municipalities nationwide, but are difficult for property owners to test or confirm. 

2. 	
The City Council has determined that the noise contours and critical areas that are relied upon in part as the basis for the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone regulations are accurate and reliable for the purposes of land use planning. The City Council has also determined that, based upon the usage patterns of the airport, the contours and the restrictions associated therewith reflect sound land planning principles and are justified based upon the current airport traffic regardless of whether the noise predictions are accurate. 

3. 	
The boundaries of the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone and its associated noise contours and critical areas shall be reviewed and amended when appropriate, either in conjunction with adoption of updated studies by the airport, or based upon other credible information and studies as determined by the City Council. 


B. 	Boundaries and Mapping. The Director shall maintain maps of the vicinity of the airport, depicting the Airport Influence Area Overlay Zone; the 55 DNL, 60 DNL, and 65 DNL noise contours, and the critical zones within and around the airport. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.02.07.04 Interference with Airport Operations Prohibited 
No use may be made of land within an Airport Influence Area that: 
1. 	
Creates electrical interference with radio communication between an Air Traffic Control (“ATC”) facility and an aircraft; 

2. 	
Makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights;

Division 18.04.01 Purpose and Application of Chapter 
18.04.01.01 Purpose of Chapter 
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide standards for: 
1. 	
The creation of new lots and the adjustment of lot boundaries; 

2. 	
The design and placement of buildings on individual lots; 

3. 	
The design and placement of other improvements on individual lots (e.g., fences, garden walls, etc.); and 

4. 
The type, size, placement, display, and illumination of signs. Effective on: 11/20/2018 



18.04.01.02 Application of Chapter 
A. 	Generally. This Chapter provides standards related to individual lots, buildings, and structures. 
B. 	Housing Palette. Division 18.04.02, Housing Palette, provides standards for a variety of housing types, including single-family detached, duplex, townhome, multiplex, multifamily, manufactured homes, micro-homes, and clustered housing types. The housing types that are described in the housing palette are allowed in each zone as provided in Section 18.02.03.02, Residential Land Use by Zone. 
C. 	Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Lots. Division 18.04.03, Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Bulk Standards, provides standards for the creation of new nonresidential or mixed-use lots, the adjustment of their lot boundaries, and the placement of buildings within them. 
D. 	Exceptions and Adjustments to Bulk Standards. Division 18.04.04, Exceptions and Adjustments to Bulk Standards, sets out the types of improvements that may encroach into required setbacks, and special setback requirements along alleys, easements, ditches, and waterbodies. 
E. 	Building Design Standards. Division 18.04.05, Building Design Standards, establishes minimum standards for the design of various types of buildings. 
F. 	Downtown Design Standards. Division 18.04.06, Downtown Design Standards, establishes building and site design standards for buildings in the DT zone. 
G. 	Supplemental Standards. Division 18.04.07, Supplemental Standards, sets out standards for accessory buildings; accessory dwelling units; accessory structures; apiaries; fences, garden walls, and hedges; outdoor displays of merchandise; outdoor storage; refuse, recycling, and compost containers; renewable energy systems; retaining walls; satellite dishes and antennae; swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas; unattended donation drop-off boxes; and vending and reverse vending machines. 
H. 	Signs. Division 18.04.08, Signs, sets out standards for the construction, installation, display, and maintenance of permanent and temporary signs. 
I. 	Modification of Bulk Standards. The bulk standards that are set out in this Chapter may be modified as provided in Division 18.17.06, Complete Neighborhoods; Division 18.17.08, Planned Unit Development, and Division 18.17.15, Administrative Variations, Design Flexibility, Reasonable Accommodations, Height Exceptions, and Variances. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

A. 	Generally. 
1. 	
The housing palette provides lot and building standards so that a variety of different housing types may be constructed. The housing palette allows an applicant to provide a variety of lot sizes and product types, but does not require a minimum floor area for any particular building (minimum floor area is set by the applicable building code). 

2. 	
After the number of dwelling units that are allowed on a subject property is calculated pursuant to Division 18.03.02, Residential Density, and after required dedications and open spaces are set aside, the applicant may design the buildable areas of the property to include any of the housing types that are allowable for the subject property pursuant to Section 18.02.03.02, Residential Land Use by Zone. 

3. 	
The design of the development is subject to the applicable provisions of PART 3: Site Design and Environmental Quality. 



B. 	Differentiating Among Single-Family Detached Housing Types. 
1. 	
Section 18.04.02.03, Single-Family Detached, sets out seven lot types for single-family detached housing. To meet the requirements for any lot type, both the lot area and the lot width minimums must be met. 

2. 	
For example: 

a. 
If a developer proposes a 4,000 sf. lot that is 45 ft. wide, the lot would be classified as an “urban” lot. 

b. 
If a developer proposes a 7,000 sf. lot that is 50 ft. wide, the lot would be classified as a “general” lot. 




C. 	Classifications that Include Floor Area Thresholds. Certain housing types are defined by their floor area (e.g., micro homes, cottages, and cluster duplexes). A micro home or cottage may be constructed as the principal dwelling unit on any single-family detached lot, and a cluster duplex may be constructed as the principal building on any duplex lot (or pair of lots, as applicable). Unlike their larger single-family detached or duplex counterparts, these “cluster housing types” may also be constructed as allowed in Section 18.04.02.07, Manufactured Homes and Micro Homes in Manufactured Home Parks and Manufactured Home Subdivisions, and Section 18.04.02.08, Clustered Housing Types. 

D. 	Alternative Standards for Condominium Ownership or Alternative Lotting Patterns. 
1. 	
The standards of this Division with respect to lot area, lot width, and setbacks relate to the development of residential buildings on conventional lots that are intended to be owned in fee-simple by the owners of the buildings. However, the standards are not intended to preclude other ownership types, such as condominiums (in which the land is owned in common by the owners of the condominium units), or common maintenance communities (in which fee simple ownership is limited to the land under the building, and, in some cases, a small area around it). 

2. 	
Alternative standards for lot area, lot width, and setbacks may be approved, provided that the proposed development could be approved pursuant to this UDC using conventional fee-simple ownership arrangements. That applicant must demonstrate that it would comply with the density, open space, and applicable setback requirements of this UDC if the proposed development was platted with lots that meet the minimum requirements of this Division for each of the proposed housing types. 


Effective on: 11/20/2018 



18.04.02.02 Lot Averaging Option 
A. 	Generally. Lot averaging allows for flexibility with regard to lot width and lot area when property is subdivided for residential uses. 
B. 	Applicability. Applicants may apply lot averaging to the housing types described in Section 18.04.02.03, Single-Family Detached, Section 18.04.02.04, Duplexes, or Section 18.04.02.05, Townhomes, as follows: 
1. 	
Lot width and lot depth may be reduced by up to 10 percent from the standards set out in the applicable table for lots up to 50 feet in width and 15 percent for lots 50 feet in width or more, provided that the average lot width and lot depth for each housing type within the subdivision is at least that which is set out in the applicable table; and 

2. 	
Each individual block in the subdivision that includes one or more lots that are modified pursuant to this Section includes: 



a. 	More than one housing type; or 
b. A mix of lot sizes such that smaller-than-average lots occupy not more than 40 percent of the block. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.04.02.03 Single-Family Detached 
A. 	Generally. Single-family detached homes are residences for one family that are typically located on a privately-owned lot, with private yards on each side of the unit. Single-family detached homes may also be located on property that is covered by a condominium declaration, surrounded by limited common elements for use by residents of the single-family detached home, which would serve the same purpose as a private yard. See Figure 18.04.02.03.A., Illustrative Single-Family Detached Home. 

B. 	Lot and Building Standards. The lot and building standards for single-family detached homes are set out in Table 18.04.02.03.A., Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards. There are seven lot types, which are classified based on their area, width, and location of vehicular access.

TABLE NOTES: 1 Maximum height (and maximum building coverage) may vary based on the zone in which the subject property is located, and whether it is within a complete neighborhood. See Sec. 18.02.03.02, Residential Land Use by Zone (which for some zones or development types refers to Sec. 18.02.04.02, Scale Thresholds in DT and Residential Zones). 2 Setbacks for alley-loaded garages shall be subject to Sec. 18.04.04.03, Setbacks Along Alleys, Sidewalks, Trail or Access Easements, Ditches, and Waterbodies. Garages that are accessed across front or side lot lines are subject to the same setbacks as the principal building. 3 Setback is measured from the property line or the back of the sidewalk, whichever provides a greater setback.  

C. 	Zero Lot Line Home. 
1. 	
Zero lot-line homes are a single-family detached housing type that differs from the typical single-family detached form in that they are situated on the lot such that one side building wall is located on a side lot line and the other side is designed to provide an expanded and useable private side yard. Lot line homes are subject to the standards of this subsection. 

2. 	
Subdivision Layout. Lots that are designated for lot-line homes must be configured such that the zero setback (the “zero lot line”) is on the same side of the lot for all of the lots on each street face. Street side setbacks are required where the side lot line borders a public right-of-way or a lot or tract that is not approved for use as a lot-line home. 

3. 	
Design Standards. To provide a reasonable level of privacy in the adjoining side yard, the following design standards apply to all lot-line homes: 

a. 	
No window shall be permitted on the zero lot line side of the house unless: 

1. 	
It opens into an enclosed light court; 

2. 	
The window sill is framed at a minimum of six foot four inches above the room floor so as to not provide a line of sight into the neighboring yard; or 

3. 	
It is composed of glass block, frosted glass, or similar treatment, and is inoperable. 



b. 	
The lot shall include a usable combined side and rear yard on the opposite of the zero-lot line. 



4. 	
Access and Maintenance Easements. Appropriate access and maintenance easements shall be provided to ensure that each lot owner is able to access and maintain the side of the building that is constructed upon the lot line. Easements for overhanging eaves may also be required, as appropriate to the design of the buildings. 

5. 	
Lot and Building Standards. The lot and building standards for lot-line homes are set out in Table 18.04.02.03.B., Lot-Line Home Lot and Building Standards.

18.04.02.06 Multiplex and Multifamily 
A. 	Generally. 
1. 	
Multiplex and multifamily are both multiple-family building types. Multiplex buildings are constructed to look like large single-family homes. See Figure 18.04.02.06.A., Illustrative Multiplex Building. Typically, multifamily takes the form of apartments or condominiums that are two or more stories in height, in walk-up or elevator-access configurations. Multifamily units may also be located in mixed-use buildings, but mixed-use buildings are subject to the standards that apply to nonresidential and mixed use buildings and not the standards of this Section. 

2. 	
For the purposes of this Code, multifamily is classified as “General Multifamily,” “Infill Multifamily,” and “Downtown Multifamily.” These classifications relate to the anticipated location, scale, and density of the housing type. 

a. 	
General multifamily refers to a development that contains two or more multifamily buildings that, together, contain more than 30 dwelling units. 

b. 	
Infill multifamily refers to a development that contains one or two multifamily buildings that, together, contain 30 or fewer dwelling units. 

c. 	
Downtown multifamily refers to “urban” multifamily development, with any number of dwelling units. This type is different from general multifamily and infill multifamily in that it is constructed next to the street right-of-way, it is generally more dense, and dwelling units that are located on upper floors are accessed from inside the building. 






B. Lot and Building Standards. Table 18.04.02.06, Multiplex and Multifamily Lot and Building Standards, sets out the lot and building requirements for multiplex and multifamily. 
Table 18.04.02.06 Multiplex and Multifamily Lot and Building Standards

TABLE NOTES: 1 May be increased as provided in Section 18.04.04.03, Setbacks Along Alleys, Sidewalks, Trail or Access Easements, Ditches, and Waterbodies. 2 The total number of units allowed on the lot is limited by the density of the zoning district in which the property is located (if the zoning district limits density), but the number of units in any individual building is not specifically limited. 3 Maximum height and maximum building coverage may vary based on the underlying zoning district or applicable overlay district in which the property is located (if the district or overlay district limits height), based on limited, adaptable, or conditional use standards, or based on whether the development is located in a complete neighborhood. 4 The maximum lot area for this housing type is 65,000 sf. 5 Stepback rules may apply, see Section 18.06.07.04, Infill Multifamily.  

Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.04.02.07 Manufactured Homes and Micro Homes in Manufactured Home Parks and Manufactured Home Subdivisions 
A. 	Generally. 
1. 	Manufactured homes are a special type of single-family detached dwelling unit, in that they are constructed in factories according to federal standards, and are designed to be moved. See Figure 18.04.02.07.A., Illustrative Manufactured Homes. There are three types of manufactured homes: 
a. 	
Single-wide (transported in one section); 

b. 	
Double-wide (transported in two sections); and 

c. 	
Triple-wide (transported in three or more sections). 



2. 	Micro homes are detached, building code compliant dwelling units with a floor area of 500 sf. or less. 

B. 	Lot and Building Standards. 
1. 	
The lot and building standards for manufactured and micro homes are set out in Table 18.04.02.07, Manufactured Home Lot and Building Standards. The standards of this section apply to micro homes and manufactured homes that are located in new manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions, or expanded areas of existing manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions. 

2. 	
In existing manufactured home parks and subdivisions, manufactured homes or micro homes may be placed on existing lots or spaces that do not comply with this section, provided that they are spaced a minimum of 10 feet apart and 10 feet from property lines.

18.04.02.08 Clustered Housing Types 
A. 	Generally. Clustered housing types are small homes that are arranged in clusters with common parking areas, common open spaces, and in some cases, a common building that includes amenities such as a shared kitchen, conference room, game room, or up to two guest rooms. There are three clustered housing building types: 
1. 	
Micro Homes. Micro homes are detached, building code compliant dwelling units with a floor area of 500 sf. or less. 

2. 	
Cottages. Cottages are detached dwelling units with a floor area that is more than 500 sf., but not more than 800 sf. 

3. 	
Cluster Duplexes. Cluster duplexes are duplex buildings in which individual dwelling units have a floor area that is 600 sf. or less. 



B. 	Housing Type Equivalencies. The clustered housing types may be mixed within a single cluster. For the purposes of the application of density standards and the minimum and maximum number of dwelling units in Table 18.04.02.08, Clustered Housing Types Site and Building Standards: 
1. 	
A cottage is counted as one dwelling unit, 

2. 	
A cluster duplex building is counted as two dwelling units, and 

3. 	
A micro unit is counted as one-half of a dwelling unit. 


For example, for the purposes of compliance with this Section, a cluster than includes two duplex buildings, four cottages, and four tiny homes would be counted as including 10 dwelling units ((2 x 2)+(4 x 1)+(4 x 0.5)). 
C. 	Site and Building Standards. The site and building standards for clustered housing types are set out in Table 18.04.02.08, Clustered Housing Types Site and Building Standards. Standards apply to the subject property upon which the cluster will be developed. Standards for individual lots in a cluster (if the cluster is divided into lots) are not specified.

2. 	The encroachments that are allowed by this Section shall not be allowed if the result would be encroachment into a required bufferyard, unless the Director approves the encroachment pursuant to Section 18.08.03.07, Variations from Bufferyard Standards. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.04.04.03 Setbacks Along Alleys, Sidewalks, Trail or Access Easements, Ditches, and Waterbodies 
A. 	Generally. This Section provides standards for adjusting setbacks near certain infrastructure and natural features. 
B. 	Alleys. 
1. 	
Increased Setback. Where this Code specifies a zero setback along an alley, the City Engineer may establish a greater setback for a subject property if the City Engineer determines that such setback is required in order to provide safe passage along the alley for passenger vehicles and service trucks (e.g., trash removal, utility trucks, etc.), adequate access for the maintenance of existing utility lines, safe movement between the alley and an intersecting street, or safe and adequate maneuvering areas from the alley to adjoining lots. 

2. 	
Garage Access. No garage door that faces an alley shall be located in the area that is between five feet from the edge of pavement of the alley and the area that is 20 feet from the edge of pavement of the alley. 


C. 	Trail or Access Easements. Outside of the DT zone and outside of Neighborhood Activity Centers within Complete Neighborhoods, buildings shall be set back 15 feet from public trail or access easements (except shared driveways) or 20 feet from the edge of the trail or access easement, whichever provides for a greater setback. Within the DT zone and Neighborhood Activity Centers within Complete Neighborhoods, no setback is required unless the City Engineer determines that a setback is necessary to provide for maintenance of the trail, or the Parks and Recreation Director determines that the building placement will create detrimental shading on the trail. 
D. 	Ditches. 
1. 	
Ditch Boundaries. Notwithstanding the described width of a ditch in a recorded ditch easement or ditch right-of­way owned in fee simple by a ditch company, the ditch company may have rights to an easement or right-of-way that are larger in width, either under the rules of adverse possession, prescription, or irrevocable license, or other applicable state or federal law. The City does not adjudicate rights that are not recorded, but in the event of a good faith dispute, the County may withhold approvals until the shared boundaries are agreed to or adjudicated. 

2. 	
Required Setbacks. For the purposes of evaluating building and structure setbacks, the boundaries of a ditch easement or ditch right-of-way that is owned in fee simple by a ditch company shall be considered property lines. 

a. 	
Drainage features, such as detention ponds, swales, and underdrains, shall be set back a sufficient distance from irrigation ditches to ensure that they will not affect the hydrology of the ditch. 

b. 	
Buildings and structures shall be set back a sufficient distance from the ditch bank to ensure that maintenance access is not impeded. 




E. 	Natural Water Courses and Waterbodies. Buildings and structures (except fences and water-dependent structures) shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark of natural water courses and waterbodies, the greater of: 
1. 	
25 feet; or 

2. 	
The distance required to ensure that the development is outside of the boundary of the FP overlay zone; or 

3. 
The distance necessary to meet the requirements of Section 18.09.06.02, Environmentally-Sensitive Areas. 



F. 	Sidewalks. Garage doors that face sidewalks shall be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the closest edge of that 
sidewalk. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.04.05 Building Design Standards 


18.04.05.01 Application of Division 
A. 	Generally. The standards that are set out in this Division apply as set out in this Section. 
B. 	New Construction. The standards of this Division shall apply to new construction of buildings of the types that are addressed in this Division, unless the subject property is located within a PUD, MAC, or E zone in which building design standards are established by approved development plans. Where an approved development plan does not contain design standards, the provisions in this Division shall apply. 
C. 	Expansions of Existing Buildings. The standards of this Division apply to expansions of existing buildings as follows: 
1. 	The standards shall apply to expansions of existing buildings after an “Application Threshold” is crossed, as follows: 
a. 	
The floor area of the existing building as of the effective date of this UDC is the “Base Floor Area.” 

b. 	
Expansions of the Base Floor Area are exempt from this Division provided that, cumulatively, they do not increase the Base Floor Area by more than 25 percent (25 percent is the “Application Threshold”). 

c. 	
When the Application Threshold is crossed, all applications for expansions of the existing building must meet the standards of this Division. See Figure 18.04.05.01, Illustrative Application. 


Figure 18.04.05.01 Illustrative Application  
1. 2. 3.  Building A had 10,000 square feet of floor area at the time this UDC was adopted. As such: a. The Base Floor Area is 10,000 square feet, and b. The Application Threshold (25 percent of the Base Floor Area) is 2,500 square feet. Two years after the UDC was adopted, the owner of Building A obtains a permit to add 1,500 square feet of floor area. a. 1,500 square feet is less than the Application Threshold, so this Division does not apply. Five years after the UDC was adopted, the owner of Building A seeks another permit to add 1,500 square feet of floor area. a. Since 1,500 square feet had already been added, the new application, if approved, would result in 3,000 square feet of cumulative expansion. b. The application thus crosses the Application Threshold (2,500 square feet), and is therefore subject to the standards of this Division.  

2. 	
It is intended that a building expansion that is subject to these standards be reasonably integrated with the existing building or site condition in a manner that is consistent with the applicable standards of this Division. 

3. 	
The standards of this Division shall not be construed to necessitate improvements to existing buildings or site conditions beyond those necessary to integrate the proposed improvement with existing conditions in a manner that is consistent with these standards. 


D. 	Exemption for Historic Buildings. The standards of this Division shall not apply to designated historic buildings or structures that are proposed to be altered or restored in compliance with a building alteration certificate authorized pursuant to Chapter 15.56, Loveland Municipal Code. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.04.05.02 Residential Buildings with Four or Fewer Dwelling Units 
A. 	Generally. These standards are intended to minimize the extent to which overhead garage doors dominate residential streetscapes, and to add visual variety in building design. The standards in this Division apply to public and private streets. 
B. 	Building Entrances. All buildings shall be designed such that a primary entrance and windows face a street . On double-frontage lots, the primary entrance must face the street from which the property takes access. 
C. 	Garage Doors. 
1. 	Recessed Design. 
a. 	
On at least 75 percent of the dwelling units on a block face, garage doors that face the street shall be recessed a minimum of four feet behind either the living portion of the house or from the front of a covered porch measuring at least six feet in depth by eight feet in length. 

b. 	
No more than 25 percent of the dwelling units on a block face shall have garage doors that face the street that do not meet the provision in subsection C.1.a., above. 

c. 	
No two homes with garage doors facing the street that do not meet the standards in subsection C.1.a., above, shall be constructed on lots that share a side property line. 

d. 	
For buildings with garages that are designed to accommodate three or more cars, the third or fourth car garage door opening shall be recessed a minimum of three feet from the vertical plane of the two-car garage door opening, or shall not have the same orientation as the first two garage doors. 


2. 	Visual Mitigation. 
a. 	
Garages that extend not more than 10 feet in front of the living portion of the house shall incorporate at least one of the following mitigation measures: 

1. 	
A defined outdoor space such as a patio or courtyard surrounded by a masonry wall or fence no more than 42 inches in height that is designed to include the entire front yard space between the front facade of the living portion of the house and the front facade of the garage, developed to extend outward to be at least flush with the garage door opening. As an alternative to the masonry wall or fence, the outdoor space may contain a permanent covered feature such as a pergola, veranda, or patio cover that integrates with the colors, materials and design of the house and is located flush with the garage door opening; or 

2. 	
A second story living area shall be constructed directly above the garage that contains architectural details and features such as dormers, windows, brackets, and roof variations, that integrate the garage into the front façade and covers a minimum of 50-percent of that portion of the garage in front of the front facade of the living unit. As an alternative for one-car garages, a second story porch that covers five feet of the 10-foot extension may substitute for a second story living area. 



b. 	
Garages that extend more than 10 feet in front of the living portion of the house shall have garage doors located perpendicular to the street. 


3. 	
Perpendicular Orientation. Garages that are adjacent to the street but that have side-facing garage doors (perpendicular to the street) shall be clad with the same predominant materials, architectural detail, and windows that mimic the features of the living portion of the dwelling on the side of the garage facing the street. 

4. 	
The following additional standards apply to garage doors that face streets: 

a. 	
Garage door openings on homes that are constructed on lots greater than 50 feet in lot width shall not comprise more than 50 percent of the street-facing building facade, except that garages that are designed to accommodate three or more cars may comprise up to 60 percent of the street-facing building facade. 

b. 	
Garage door openings on homes on lots of less than 50 feet in width shall be handled on a case-by-case with design review. Architectural treatments and design elements shall be used to soften the effects of the garage door openings such as the following: 

1. 	
The overhead garage door shall be recessed beneath a second story deck, pergola, or veranda measuring at least six feet in depth and matching the street-facing building facade in width; or 

2. 	
A second story living element is incorporated above the garage. 





5. 	
Alley Exemption. Overhead doors facing alleys are exempt from the provisions in this subsection C. 

6. 	
Alternative Treatments. Alternative overhead garage door treatments may be approved by the Director if: 

a. 	
The configuration of the lot or other existing physical constraints make the application of the standards of this subsection C. impractical; or 

b. 	
The proposed design substantially meets the intent of this subsection to line streets with active living spaces, create pedestrian-oriented streetscapes, and provide variety and visual interest in the exterior design of residential buildings. 





D. 	Roof Design. The maximum length of a continuous street facing roof ridge is 40 feet, unless the roof is punctuated by dormers or intersections with perpendicular roof systems. 
E. 	Housing Model Variety. Single family detached, duplex, or multiplex building developments that contain more than 10 dwelling units shall comply with the following standards: 
1. 	
Distinguishing Features. Each housing model shall have at least three characteristics which clearly and obviously distinguish it from the other housing models, which characteristics may include, without limitation, differences in exterior materials, changes in roof lines, garage placement, placement of the footprint on the lot, and / or building fenestration. 

2. 	
Differentiation of Models. Any development of 100 or more housing units shall have at least four different types of housing models. Any development containing fewer than 100 housing units shall have at least three different types of housing models. The applicant shall include documentation on how the development will comply with this requirement with the submittal of their housing palette. 


F. 	Architectural Diversity Standard. The standards of this subsection apply to each new development that contains 20 or more single-family detached, duplex, or multiplex dwelling units (not including clustered housing types). The standards are applied to “proximate lots,” which are lots that adjoin or share side property lines, or lots that, although separated by a street, face each other such that the extension of side lot lines across the street creates an overlap along the front lot line of more than 30 percent. 
1. 	General Standards. No two buildings of similar front elevation shall be constructed or located on more than three proximate lots. Front elevations shall be deemed to be similar if there is no substantial difference in the: 
a. 	
Roof lines (see subsection F.2., below); 

b. 	
Fenestration (see subsection F.3., below); and 

c. 	
Color or type of cladding materials (see subsection F.4., below). 


2. 	Roof Lines. For the purpose of this subsection F., the following differences in roof lines that are visible on the front building elevation are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection F.1.a., above: 
a. 	
Changing gable roofs to hip roofs or vice-versa; 

b. 	
Providing an intersecting roof ridge or dormer on the main roof, provided that the height of the intersecting roof or dormer is at least 50 percent of the height of the main roof; 

c. 	
Rotating gable roof systems 90 degrees; or 

d. 	
Other comparable changes that are approved by the Director. 


3. 	Fenestration. For the purpose of this subsection F., the following differences in the size, location, or type of windows that are visible on the front building elevation are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection F.1.b., above: 
a. 	
Changing from single windows to a multiple window arrangement or vice-versa; 

b. 	
Changing the types of windows (e.g., casement to double hung); or 

c. 	
In the event that because of its size, location or design, one window is the predominant window on the front building elevation, if the size, location, or type of that window is changed, then no other window need be changed. 



4. 	Cladding and Color. For the purpose of this subsection F., the following differences in the size, location, or type of windows that are visible on the front building elevation are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection F.1.c., above: 
a. 	Changes in cladding materials throughout the facade or elevation for a minimum of one story in height. 
b. Changes in color (rather than merely shade). Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.04.05.03 Residential Buildings with More than Four Dwelling Units 
A. 	Generally. The standards of this Section apply to all residential buildings that contain more than four dwelling units (including multiplex, multifamily (all types), and townhomes), except those that are located in the DT Zone. 
B. 	Horizontal Articulation. 
1. 	Buildings that are three or more stories in height shall include elements that provide meaningful horizontal articulation on building elevations facing public streets, street-like private drives, or open space, including at least one change in cladding materials (e.g., from brick to siding, or from stone to stucco), and any combination of two or more of the following: 
a. 	
Awnings that are aligned on a horizontal plane; 

b. 	
Balconies; 

c. 	
Belt courses, score lines, or other relief, combined with a change in color; or 

d. 	
Stepbacks or cantilevered projections from the building wall. 


2. 	Townhomes shall include elements that differentiate the townhome units from each other. Such elements may include: 
a. 	
Offsetting wall planes on the front building elevation at common walls, or at other locations on the front building elevation that highlight the differentiation among the individual dwelling units; 

b. 	
Changes in cladding materials and color from dwelling unit to dwelling unit; or 

c. 	
Changes in roofline or parapet height from dwelling unit to dwelling unit. 


C. 	Offsets and Variation of Wall Planes. Building elevations that are 60 feet or longer (except townhome elevations that comply with subsection B., above) shall include offsets according to the standards of this Subsection. 
1. 	
Maximum Distance Between Offsets. 50 feet 

2. 	
Minimum Offset Distance (measured perpendicularly to the wall plane from which the offset is taken). 

a. 	
Two feet; or 

b. 	
Partially recessed balconies that meet the requirements of this subsection C. may be used to meet the offset requirement, if the balcony extends at least two feet from the building wall plane and the total depth of the balcony is at least six feet. 



3. 	
Minimum Width of Offset. 10 feet 

4. 	
Minimum Height of Offset. The minimum vertical distance of each offset shall be as follows (the vertical distance may be interrupted for elements such as a recessed portion of a balcony): 

a. 	
One-story buildings: 90 percent of the height of the wall that establishes the plane from which the offset is taken. 

b. 	
Two or more story buildings: 70 percent of the height of the wall that establishes the plane from which the offset is taken. 



5. 	
Materials. Offsets shall be incorporated into the architecture and materials of the principal building (e.g., wood decking with wood post supports that are mounted on a ledgerboard on a continuous wall plane is not sufficient to achieve the offset required by this Subsection). 


Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.04.05.04 General Building Design Standards 
A. 	Generally. The standards of this Section are intended to promote high-quality buildings. Accordingly, the City may require prototypical or franchise architecture to be modified to meet these standards. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, modifications to roofs, windows, doors, building mass, materials, building colors, and placement of architectural features and details. Franchise architectural styles found to meet the standards of this Section and other applicable standards of this UDC will not require modification. 
B. 	Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all buildings, including buildings in commercially-designated areas of a PUD and buildings that are subject to Division 18.11.05, Other Physical Nonconformities, except that the standards in this Section shall not apply to:

a. 	
Bed and Breakfast; 

b. 	
Campground; 

c. 	
Parks (passive); and 

d. 	
RV Park. 




C. 	Limited Application to Industrial Buildings in I Zone and PUD Zones. The standards of this Section do not apply to buildings that are located in the I Zone, except as follows: 
1. 	
For such buildings in the I zone, the exterior portions of the building that enclose the non-industrial space shall comply with the this section. 

2. 	
These standards shall apply to the buildings in the I Zone that are located on sites that are adjacent to an arterial street, if at least 50 percent of the building’s gross floor area is put to a use other than a use listed in Table 18.02.03.07, Industrial, Processing, Recycling, Storage, and Disposal Land Use by Zone, counting any outdoor area used for retail displays as an area put to non-industrial use. 

3. 	
When these standards are applied to buildings that contain industrial and non-industrial uses, only the area of the building that encloses non-industrial uses is required to comply with this section. 


D. 	Discretionary Waiver of Commercial Building Design Standards. 
1. 	
The Director may waive the application of the standards set forth in this Section as applied to side or rear building walls in cases where the visibility of the walls is obstructed from adjacent properties or streets by any combination of landscaping, buffering, topography, distance, or decorative screening walls or earthen berms, provided that such screening is at least 60 percent opaque to a height of six feet upon installation, and at least 80 percent opaque to a height of six feet within five years after planting. 

2. 	
If living materials are used to meet the standards of subsection D.1., above, said landscaping shall consist of primarily evergreen plant material to provide year-round screening. The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition by the property owner. In the event any required landscaping material dies or is 



destroyed, it shall be replaced by the owner within six months. Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of the landscape plan. 
E. 	Design Continuity in Multi-Building Developments. Developments with multiple buildings shall include predominant characteristics in each building so that the buildings within the development appear to be part of a cohesive, planned area, yet are not monotonous in design. Predominant characteristics may include use of the same, similar, or complimentary architectural style, materials, and colors. 
F. 	Primary Building Entrances. Primary public entrances shall be clearly defined and recessed and projected or framed by elements such as awnings, arcades, porticos, or other comparable architectural features. 
G. 	Building Colors. 
1. 	
Colors shall be used to blend buildings into their context, and to unify different elements of a development. Color should compliment the surrounding area and, if in a new development area, shall be selected to establish an attractive image and set a standard of quality for future developments and buildings within the area. 

2. 	
Buildings that are larger than 10,000 square feet shall be finished with more than one color on all elevations that are visible from public streets. 

3. 	
Accent colors that are used to call attention to a particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern, shall be compatible with the predominant building base colors. Accent colors shall cover no more than five percent of a street-facing building elevation. 



H. 	Design Integration. 
1. 	
Building design shall contribute to the special or unique characteristics of an area and/or development through building massing and scale, building materials, architectural elements, and color palette. 

2. 	
Design integration shall be achieved through any combination of techniques, such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of comparable proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, comparable relationships to the street, comparable window and door patterns on street-facing facades, or the use of building materials that have color shades and textures that are comparable to or complimentary to those existing on, or in the immediate area of, the subject property. 

3. 	
Where there is no established or consistent neighborhood or area character or unifying theme, or where it is not desirable to reinforce the existing character because it does not reflect a design theme that is consistent with the architectural standards as described in this Division, the proposed development shall be designed to establish an attractive image and set a standard of quality for future development. 


I. 	Building Design. All buildings shall be designed and maintained using the following building elements, with a minimum of one item each selected from four of the five groups below: 
1. 	Group 1 – Exterior Wall Articulation.

c. 	
A recognizable base treatment of the wall consisting of thicker walls, ledges, or sills using integrally textured and colored materials such as stone, masonry, or a decorative concrete; or 

d. 	
Some other architectural feature that breaks up the exterior horizontal and vertical mass of the wall in a manner equivalent to subsections I.1.a., b., or c., above. 


2. 	Group 2 – Roof Articulation. 
a. 	
Changes in roof lines, including the use of stepped cornice parapets, a combination of flat and sloped roofs, or pitched roofs with at least two roof line elevation changes; or 

b. 	
Some other architectural feature or treatment that breaks up the exterior horizontal and vertical mass of the roof in a manner equivalent to subsection I.2.a., above. 



3. 	Group 3 – Building Openings, Walkways and Entrances. 
a. 	
Canopies or awnings over at least 30 percent of the openings of the building; or 

b.

d. 	
Some other architectural feature or treatment that adds definition to the building openings, walkways or entrances in a manner equivalent to subsection I.3.a., b., or c., above. 


4. 	Group 4 – Cladding Materials. 
a. 	
At least two kinds of materials distinctively different in texture or masonry pattern, at least one of which is decorative block, brick or stone, with each of the required materials covering at least 25 percent of the exterior walls (excluding the areas of windows, doors, and overheard doors) of the building; or 

b. 	
Brick or stone (including synthetic stone) covering at least 50 percent of the exterior walls (excluding the areas of windows, doors, and overheard doors) of the building. 


5. 	Group 5 – Other Architectural Definition. 
a. 	
Overhanging eaves extending at least 24 inches past the supporting walls, or with flat roofs, cornice parapets or capstone finish; or 

b. 	
Ornamental lighting fixtures (excluding neon) for all exterior building lighting; or 

c. 	
Other features that add architectural definition to the building, in a manner equivalent to subsection I.5.a., or b., above. 


J. 	Articulation of Walls. No horizontal width of building wall shall run for more than 100 feet without a wall plane projection or recess having a depth of at least four percent of the length of the building elevation, extending for a distance that is not less than 20 percent of the width of the building elevation. 

K. 	Loading Docks and Trash or Recycling Storage and Pickup Areas.

3. 	
If the subject property has multiple street frontages, loading docks and trash or recycling pickup areas shall be located in the least obtrusive manner, with preference for sides of the building that do not face streets or surface parking lots (except employee-only parking lots), then for sides that are set back more than 150 feet, and if such location is not practicable, the frontage with the least public visibility. 


L. 	Multi-Building Developments. Developments with multiple buildings shall integrate architectural characteristics into each building, that, taken together in the aggregate, make the development appear to be a cohesive, planned area that is not monotonous in design. Such architectural characteristics may include use of the same, similar, or complementary architectural styles, materials, or colors. 
M. Exterior Building Illumination. 
1. 	The following are not allowed: 
a. 	
Illumination that highlights the entire width of a building elevation, or a significant portion of a building elevation; and 

b. 	
Back-lit translucent awnings. 


2. 	This subsection is not intended to preclude the use of lighting (including neon lighting) to accent limited portions of a building elevation. 

1. 	
Metal wall panels with exposed fasteners (e.g., wall panels commonly referred to as “R-Panel,” “U-Panel,” “Corrugated Panel,” “7.2 Panel,” and other comparable panel systems), and metal wall panels with hidden fasteners that have a corrugated appearance that resembles the typical exposed fastener panels described above, combined, shall not be used as cladding on any building wall. 

2. 	
Standing seam metal panels may be used for cladding on not more than 25 percent of any building wall (exclusive of windows, doors, and overhead doors), provided that they integrate into the architectural style and color of the building. 

3. 	
Insulated architectural metal wall panels with hidden fasteners are allowed without limitation, provided that they do not have a corrugated appearance that resembles the typical exposed fastener panels described in subsection N.1., above. 

4. 	
The Director may permit other metal cladding or finishes, such as bronze, brass, copper, or wrought iron, if a 


determination is made that such materials are equal or superior to the primary building materials. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.04.05.05 Building Design Standards in the I Zone 
A. 	Generally. The standards of this Section are intended to promote high-quality buildings in the I Zone, when such buildings are adjacent to major streets and therefore have an impact on the image and character of the City. These standards may require changes including, but not limited to, modifications to roofs, windows, doors, building mass, materials, colors, and inclusion of architectural features and details. 
B. 	Applicability.

18.04.06.07 Fourth Street Character Area Urban Design Standards 
A. 	Generally. The intent of this Section is to preserve and enhance the historic character of the Fourth Street character area; to enhance the area as a specialty retail, restaurant, and entertainment district; and to maintain and enhance a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
B. 	Applicability. These standards shall be applicable to properties within the Fourth Street character area. See Section 18.04.06.02, Establishment of Character Areas and Primary Pedestrian Streets. 

1. 	
New Construction. These standards shall apply to new construction of buildings and structures. 

2. 	
Facade Renovation. 

a. 	
These standards shall apply to facade renovations. Standards shall apply only to the portion(s) of elevation(s) which are being renovated. 

b. 	
The Director may waive the requirements of this Section with regard to including a storefront within a renovated facade if: 

1. 	
The building was not originally constructed with a storefront, or had not been renovated to create a storefront in the past; 

2. 	
The installation of a storefront is not practicable based on the cost of such renovation being greater than 50 percent of the total building permit valuation for the work being performed on the structure; or 

3. 	
The proposed renovation will not materially change the form of the facade. 



c. 	
No change in existing setbacks shall be required under this Section for a facade renovation. 



3. 	
Lots that Do Not Have Frontage on Fourth Street. Lots that are located in the Fourth Street character area, but with no lot line adjacent to Fourth Street, shall comply with standards for the core area (see Section 18.04.06.05, Core Character Area Urban Design Standards). 


C. 	Building Disposition in Fourth Street Character Area. Front, side, and rear setbacks or build-to lines in the Fourth Street character area shall be as shown in Table 18.04.06.07.A., Setbacks and Build-To Lines.

Lot Line  Distance  Setback or Build-To  
Fourth Street Lot Line1, 3  0  Build-To  
Rear Lot Line2  0  Setback  
Side Lot Line  0  Setback  
TABLE NOTES: 1 Except for minor recesses and projections and recessed doorways. 2 Garage doors shall be set back five feet or less or eighteen feet or more from alley rights of way. 3 Variation of the build-to line may be allowed in order to allow for the plaza spaces shown in the Destination Downtown HIP Streets Master Plan.  

D. 	Building Units. The provisions of this subsection are intended to result in building forms that are compatible with the historic pattern of 25 foot wide lots and storefronts found in the Fourth Street character area (see Figure 18.04.06.07.A., Illustrative Building Unit Diagram). 
1. 	
New buildings constructed along Fourth Street shall, at the ground floor, shall be segmented into storefronts of between 20 feet and 50 feet in width. 

2. 	
Each storefront shall have a separate entrance. 

3. 	
Each storefront shall be separated from the adjoining storefront by a solid vertical element or feature a minimum of eight inches wide. 

4. 	
Buildings with more than 75 feet of facade width facing Fourth Street shall be designed so as to appear to be multiple buildings (e.g., using obvious changes in facade cladding material, window design, facade height, cornice treatment, or other decorative details). There should be some slight variation in alignments among the facade elements (e.g., window heights). 




E. 	Corner Buildings. The provisions of this subsection are intended to ensure that buildings that front on two streets reinforce the pedestrian orientation of both streets through window and door openings--a characteristic that is common within the Fourth Street character area. This enhances pedestrian comfort and the walkability of the DT zone. 
1. 	
Corner buildings are those that have a frontage on Fourth Street and frontage on an intersecting street including Garfield Avenue, Railroad Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, or Washington Avenue. 

2. 	
For lots located at the corner of Fourth Street and any intersecting street, storefronts shall be designed to appear to wrap around corners by including a corner entrance or large pane display window at least ten feet in width along the side street facade. See Figure 18.04.06.07.B., Illustrative Corner Treatments. 

3. 	
Any corner building having more than seventy-five feet of frontage on an intersecting street, shall have at least one storefront at ground level (as described in subsection F.3.), facing the intersecting street and measuring at least 25 feet in width. 



Figure 18.04.06.07.B. Illustrative Corner Treatments  

 

 

F. 	Architectural Features. The provisions in this subsection are intended to lead to a building form that is compatible with the existing historic character of the Fourth Street character area, and that maintains or enhances the attractiveness of the area for specialty retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses, and maintains or enhances the pedestrian-friendly character of this area. See Figure 18.04.06.07.C., Illustrative Architectural Treatments. 


1. 	
Upper floors shall be designed with a pattern of vertically oriented windows with spacing between windows, and a ratio of solid-to-void similar to surrounding historical facades. 

2. 	
Floor-to-floor heights of the ground floor and upper floors shall appear to be compatible with surrounding historic buildings; 

3. 	
Ground floor facades facing Fourth Street shall be designed as a typical storefront having the following features: 

a. 	
Large display windows with metal or wood frames; 

b. 	
Transom windows; 

c. 	
Kick plates that are between 12 and 30 inches in height above the sidewalk, constructed of metal, tile, stone, brick, or comparable high-quality material. 



4. 	
Ground floor storefront doorways shall be recessed a minimum of three feet from the front plane of the building. The width of the recessed area shall not be more than 40 percent of the width of the individual storefront or 20 feet, whichever is less. 

5. 	
A recessed storefront doorway is not required for every entrance to a building that is divided into more than one store-front. Secondary doors and doors servicing upstairs uses are not required to be recessed unless the door is required to open outwards by building or fire codes. 

6. 	
Ornamentation or a banding technique shall be used to provide a visual cue that appears to delineate the ground floor from the upper floors. 

7. 	
Excepting the recessed door and any upper-story stepbacks, the facade should appear as predominantly flat, with any decorative elements and projecting or setback “articulations” appearing to be subordinate to the dominant building form. 

8. 	
The roof shall incorporate a parapet wall with a cornice treatment, capstone finish, or similar feature facing public streets. 

9. 	
Awnings, if used, shall provide weather protection, express the dimensions of the storefront framing, and not obscure characteristic lines or details of the facade. 

10. 	
Facades are not required to mimic historic buildings, but shall be of a style that is compatible to the historic character of Fourth Street in terms of rhythm, massing, cladding and glazing material, and design. Thematic facade designs that were not historically present in the DT zone (such as “Swiss chalet”) shall not be used. 


G. 	Building Finish Materials. This subsection is intended to ensure that quality materials that will compliment the existing character and historic precedent of the Fourth Street character area will be used in new construction and renovations, and that building facades will be durable, maintain or improve the attractiveness of the area for specialty retail, restaurant, and entertainment uses, and maintain or enhance the pedestrian-friendly character of this area. 
1. 	
Facades facing Fourth Street shall consist of brick, stone, masonry, or similar high quality, traditional cladding material.

4. 	
These materials standards shall not apply to upper floors that are stepped back to comply with Section 18.04.06.03, Downtown Building Height. 



H. 	Building Openings. These provisions are intended to result in a permeable street wall that matches existing character and historic precedent and enhances the pedestrian and retail character of the Fourth Street character area. The standards of this subsection do not apply to renovations to existing buildings unless the standards can be met by safely opening original windows, doors, or storefronts that were previously closed. 
1. 	
Windows and doors shall comprise a minimum percentage of facades facing public streets rights-of-way, as indicated by Table 18.04.06.07.B., Minimum Facade Openings. 

2. 	
Any section of wall facing Garfield Avenue, Arthur Avenue, Railroad Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, or Jefferson Avenue may not exceed 25 feet in width without containing windows or doors on the ground floor. 

3. 	
Highly reflective or darkly tinted glass is not allowed in first-floor storefront display windows. 

4. 	
During renovation of the facade of a building that has been evaluated as contributing to a downtown historic district in the Historic Preservation Plan, historic window openings that have been altered shall be restored if feasible and consistent with applicable building codes.

18.04.06.08 Neighborhood Transition Character Area Urban Design Standards 
A. 	Generally. Certain areas of the DT zone maintain a largely consistent character of high-quality historic homes. The neighborhood transition character area is meant to protect the character of these areas when redevelopment or new development occurs, while allowing for a mix of uses appropriate to these areas and allowed by zoning. The neighborhood transition areas are also meant to transition to adjoining neighborhoods. 
B. 	Applicability. These standards shall be applicable to properties within the neighborhood transition character area. See Section 18.04.06.02, Establishment of Character Areas and Primary Pedestrian Streets. 
1. 	
New Construction. These standards shall apply to new construction of buildings and structures, including additions to existing buildings or structures. 

2. 	
Facade Renovation. These standards shall apply only to those portion(s) of each elevation that is being renovated. This section shall not require a change in existing setbacks during a facade renovation. 

3. 	
Exception to Setback Requirements. This section shall not be interpreted to require modification of existing setbacks in cases of building expansion, except that a building cannot be expanded in such a manner that the setback of the new construction will not conform to subsection D, below. 

4. 	
Limited Exceptions for Single-Family Detached and Duplex Residential Uses. These standards, other than those pertaining to setbacks, shall not apply to single-family detached and duplex residential uses. 



C. 	Massing and Architectural Rhythm. 
1. 	
Continuation of Massing Pattern. New buildings or additions shall continue a massing pattern that is similar to the existing pattern of the block face as shown in Figure 18.04.06.08.A., Illustrative Rhythm of Block Face. For the purposes of this subsection, massing shall refer to height, width, bulk, roof form, roof slope, and direction of slope. Compliance may be accomplished by creating independent building modules through articulation, roofline, or other distinguishing features. 

2. 	
Roof Form. New buildings shall have pitched roofs including hips or gables in order to reflect the residential character of the area, unless the buildings located on a lot with frontage on Washington Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, or Lincoln Avenue. 

3.

a. 	
Building elevations that face a public street shall consist of at least 15 percent openings (i.e., windows and doors). 

b. 	
Each principal building shall have at least one entrance facing a public street. This entrance shall have a direct pedestrian connection to the adjacent sidewalk. 



4. 	
Garage Placement and Design. Attached garages shall be setback from the front facade of the building a minimum of six feet. The width of the total elevation of garage doors facing a public street may be no more than eighteen feet. 



D. 	Cladding Materials. Facades that are visible from a public street, public plaza, or public pedestrian space shall be finished with quality materials that reinforce the pedestrian character of the downtown, as follows: 
1. 	
At least 30 percent of the cladding (which does not include windows and doors) of each street-facing facade shall consist of brick or stone or finish materials that are consistent with the historic character of the area. 

2. 	
Architectural metal shall not account for more than 20 percent of the cladding material on any facade. 

3. 	
Exterior insulated finishing systems (“EIFS”) may be used for architectural details, provided that not more that five percent of any facade is finished with EIFS, and all EIFS is installed at least eight feet above adjacent grade. 



E. 	Setbacks. 
1. 	
Building setbacks shall be in accordance with Table 18.04.06.08, Setbacks in Neighborhood Transition Character Area. Front setbacks shall be within four feet of the average setback on the block face, provided that the resulting setback is in keeping with the pattern of the block face. See Figure 18.04.06.08.B., Measurement of Average Setback, for an example of how a front yard setback is determined. 

2. 	
Setbacks Along Washington Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. For lots with frontage on Washington Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, or Lincoln Avenue, the setback for buildings may be reduced or buildings may be built to the back of the public sidewalk on all street frontages, provided there is a transition between the corner lot and the rest of the block face. Such transition may include: 

a. 	
A front yard setback that meets the requirements of subsection E.1. for a minimum width of 25 feet, combined with a building massing of at least 25 feet in width that is similar to the massing pattern on the rest of the intersecting street's block face, that is implemented for the entire length, front to back, of the building, and has at least two of the following characteristics that are comparable to typical buildings along the block face: 

1. 	
height; 

2. 	
width; 

3. 	
bulk; 

4. 	
roof form; or 

5. 	
roof slope and direction of slope (see Figure 18.04.06.08.C., Illustrative Transition); or 



b. 	
An existing alley.

F. 	
Additions, Expansions, or Modifications to Existing Buildings. The intent of this subsection is to provide guidelines that maintain the residential character of the largely historically intact neighborhood transition character areas when existing buildings are expanded or converted from residential to commercial use. All of the following apply to additions, expansions, or modifications to existing buildings: 

1. 	
When a residential structure is converted into a commercial use, the basic residential form of the building shall be maintained. 

2. 	
Existing front porches shall remain and shall not be enclosed. 

3. 	
The existing window pattern on street-facing facades shall not be materially changed. 

4.

5. 	
Additions or expansions to existing buildings shall not be in front of the front building elevation or side building elevation on corner lots unless the existing elevation is set back more than three feet from the allowed setback on the affected block face. 

6. 	
Additions or expansions of an existing building shall utilize a roof form with the same pitch as the existing roof and be constructed of similar material as the original building. 



7. 
The use of architectural metal as anything other than an accent material is prohibited. Effective on: 11/20/2018 




18.04.06.09 Exceptions to Design Standards 
Exceptions to the standards in this division (Division 18.04.06, Downtown Design Standards) may be granted by the Planning Commission, provided: 
1. 	
The applicant submits a written request to the Director to have the request for an exception be considered by Planning Commission; 

2. 	
The Planning Commission finds that granting any such exception would either: 

a. 	
Result in only a de minimus departure from the design standards; or 

b. 	
Satisfy the intent of the design standards to promote high-quality architecture that is compatible with the surrounding built environment, and not conflict with the objectives of the DT Zone as set out in Section 18.02.02.01, Zones Established.

Except as provided in subsection A.3., below, architectural features, structural supports, and landscape elements shall not be included within the sign face area. 

2. 	
Wall Signs. For the purpose of determining sign face area (and the number of wall signs, in locations where the number of wall signs is limited), wall signs that are located closer than five feet to each other will be counted as a single sign, unless: 

a. 	
They are attached to a different building elevation; 

b. 	
They are attached to building walls that are not on the same vertical plane; 

c.

necessary to ensure compliance with the current adopted Fire Code. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

Division 18.05.02 Access and Circulation 
18.05.02.01 Access Approval Required; Access Standards 
A. 	Generally. Access approval from the City is required for access onto the City’s streets, as provided in the City of Loveland Street Standards. Approval is granted during the development review process (through plan approval) or by issuance of a right-of-way permit. 
B. 	State Highways. All access onto State Highways shall comply with the Colorado Department of Transportation State Highway Access Code, and is subject to approval by the Colorado Department of Transportation. 
C. 	Types of Access. There are two types of access that are subject to permitting: 
1. 	
Access for land use (driveways); and 

2. 	
Public streets (street intersections). 


D. 	Design Requirements. Driveways and intersections shall be designed as provided in the City of Loveland Street Standards to provide for the safety of motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. 
E. 	Restricted Access. Generally, direct access to individual lots from Collectors and Arterials is restricted, and all/any 
access must meet the criteria (separation, location, design, etc.) identified in the City of Loveland Street Standards. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.02.02 Sight Triangles 
A. 	Generally. Street intersections, alley-street intersections, and street connections to adjacent property shall be designed so that adequate sight distance is provided along the streets. The required sight distance shall be determined by the design speed and grades of the street and the acceleration rate of an average vehicle as prescribed below. 
B. 	Minimum Requirements. All designs must provide minimum safe stopping sight distance in accordance with Chapter 7, City of Loveland Street Standards, and AASHTO. In addition, for all streets that intersect with arterial and collector streets, the sight distance must be large enough to allow a vehicle to enter the street and accelerate to the average running speed without interfering with the traffic flow on the arterial or collector street.

4. 	
Logically connects adjoining properties where appropriate; 

5. 	
Minimizes the number of vehicular turning movements and points of vehicular conflict (particularly at access points); and 

6. 
Minimizes points of potential conflict between pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Effective on: 11/20/2018 




18.05.02.04 Stacking 
A. 	Generally. Stacking spaces are used to measure the capacity of a drive-through lane to hold cars while transactions are taking place at drive-through stations. Stacking spaces measure eight feet wide by 20 feet long and provide direct access to a service window, ATM, or station at a drive-through bank (collectively, for the purposes of this section, a “station”). The position in front of a station is counted as a stacking space. 
B. 	Requirements. Uses that include drive-through service shall provide not less than the following numbers of stacking spaces: 
1. 	
Financial institutions, convenience retail, liquor store, or pharmacy: Three stacking spaces per station. 

2. 	
Coffee shop (except as provided in subsection B.4.): Eight stacking spaces. 

3. 	
Restaurant: Five stacking spaces. 

4. 	
Drive-through only use in a building with less than 300 square feet of gross floor area and no detached menu board (e.g., coffee stands): Three stacking spaces per station. 

5. 	
Dry cleaner: Two stacking spaces per station. 

6. 	
Vehicle Wash: 

a. 	
Three stacking spaces for each bay in a self-service vehicle wash facility; 

b. 	
Five stacking spaces for each in-bay or conveyor vehicle wash facility; and 

c. 	
If the facility provides detailing, manual drying or polishing, and / or vacuuming, sufficient area to provide those services without creating additional demand for stacking at the vehicle wash entrance. 



7. 	
Stacking spaces for other uses are determined by the Director. 


C. 	Design. 
1. 	
Stacking lanes shall be clearly marked, and shall not interfere with on-site or off-site traffic circulation or parking access. 

2. 	
Generally, stacking areas shall not be situated between the facade of a building and the primary street frontage. The Director may waive this requirement if: 

a. 	
Either: 

1. 	
The applicant demonstrates that the subject property is unusual in its configuration such that such design is necessary; or 

2. 	
The applicant demonstrates that the configuration of the stacking area is preferable in terms of mitigating impacts on adjoining properties; and 



b. 	
A parking lot bufferyard is installed and maintained between the stacking lane and the street. 



3. 	
If a stacking area is aligned in parallel to a secondary street frontage and is not screened from the street by 


buildings, a parking lot bufferyard shall be installed and maintained between the stacking area and the street. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.05.03 Parking and Loading Calculations 



18.05.03.01 Calculation of Required Parking Spaces 

A. 	Generally. Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables, sets out the number of parking spaces that are required for each land use that is listed in Division 18.02.03, Land Use by Zone. The number of parking spaces is based on one or more independent variables, which are measured as provided in this Section. 
B. 	Factors. The factors for parking calculations are measured as follows: 
1. 	
Per sf. The phrase “per sf.” means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of square feet of gross floor area put to the use, as calculated using the methodology in Section 18.19.01.05, Floor Area and Floor Area Ratio. 

2. 	
Per dwelling unit or per BR. The phrase “per du” means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of dwelling units. In some cases, the parking requirements are based on the number of bedrooms (per “#” BR du) in the dwelling units. 

3. 	
Per Bed. The phrase “per bed” means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of beds in the facility instead of the number of sleeping rooms or some other measure. Per bed calculations are normally applied to uses that offer residential care or overnight accommodations with shared rooms. 

4. 	
Per Employee. The phrase “per employee” means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees (full-time and part-time) on the maximum shift, that is, the work shift in which the maximum number of employees are present. 

5. 	
Per Seat / Per Seat Design Capacity. The phrase "per seat" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of seats that are provided to guests (patrons, members, etc.); and the phrase “per seat design capacity” means that the number of parking spaces is based on the maximum seating capacity of the use as determined by applicable fire codes. 

6. 	
Per Person Design Capacity. The phrase “per person design capacity” means that the number of parking spaces is based on the maximum number of people who may occupy the use pursuant to applicable fire code standards or licensing requirements, whichever is less. 

7. 	
Others. Other factors are measured according to their common meanings. 


C. 	Rounding. When the calculation of required parking spaces results in a fractional parking space, the result of the parking calculation shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
D. 	Tandem Parking Spaces. Tandem spaces are not counted towards the parking requirements of this Division, except as follows: 
1. 	
Residential Uses. Where a garage is provided for an individual dwelling unit, tandem spaces in front of the garage are counted toward meeting off-street parking requirements for the dwelling unit, provided that the unit is within a single-family detached, duplex, townhome, or multiplex. 

2. 	
Valet Parking. Tandem spaces may be used in lots that are designated exclusively for valet parking. 


E. 	Parking Reductions. Generally, the total number of required parking spaces is equal to the sum of the required parking for each use of a subject property. However, parking requirements may be reduced according to the methodology of Section 18.05.03.05, Shared Parking, and the provisions of Section 18.05.03.06, Parking Credits and Reductions. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.03.02 Exemptions from Parking Requirements 
Nonresidential and mixed-use development that is located within the boundaries of General Improvement District #1 is exempt from the parking requirements of this Division. However, if parking is provided, such parking shall be designed as provided in Division 18.05.04, Parking and Loading Design. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018

18.05.03.04 Required Accessible Parking Spaces 
A. 	Generally. Parking spaces that are accessible to disabled persons (“accessible parking spaces”) shall be provided as set out in this Section. Such spaces shall be counted toward the total number of spaces that are provided for compliance with Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables, after applicable reductions pursuant to Section 18.05.03.05, Shared Parking. Section 18.05.03.06, Parking Credits and Reductions. 

B. 	Number of Required Spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall be provided as set out in Table 18.05.03.04, Number of Accessible Parking Spaces, or as required by the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, Section 208 (as may be amended or retitled from time to time) (“ADAAG”), whichever requires more parking spaces and more van accessible parking spaces for disabled persons.

C. 	Use-Specific Standards. Hospital outpatient facilities, rehabilitation facilities or outpatient physical therapy facilities, 
and residential uses are subject to ADAAG §§ 208.2.1, 208.2.2, and 208.2.3, respectively. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.03.05 Shared Parking 
A. 	Generally. The City encourages the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce impervious surfaces or enhance the efficiency of land use. Thus, where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the utilization of parking spaces due to differences in peak parking demand periods, the City may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this Section. 
B. 	Shared Parking Table. Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a subject property is occupied by two or more uses that typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed in Table 18.05.03.05.A., Shared Parking, the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the Director by the following procedures: 
1. 	
Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals (except car share programs), by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 18.05.03.05.A., Shared Parking, for each of the designated time periods. 

2. 	
Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods (columns). The minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums, plus any reserved spaces that were excluded from the calculation in the first step. Figure 18.05.03.05.A., Illustrative Shared Parking Credit Calculation, provides an example of how to use Table 18.05.03.05.A., Shared Parking, to calculate required parking.

EXAMPLE: A mixed-use building has 50, 2-bedroom residences, 50,000 square feet of office space, and 50,000 square feet of retail space. Separately, these uses would require 450 parking spaces ((50 sp. x 2 sp. / unit) + (50,000 sf. x (1 sp. / 250 sf.)) + (50,000 sf. x (3 sp. / 1,000 sf.)) = 450).

TABLE NOTE: 1The largest number, 350, is the number of parking spaces that are required. This example is a 22 percent reduction compared to individual calculations.  

C. 	Special Shared Parking Study. 
1. 	In the alternative to the methodology in subsection B., above, an applicant may submit a special study to demonstrate that the parking required to serve mixed uses is less than the sum of the parking requirements for each individual use. The special study shall be conducted by a qualified transportation planner or traffic engineer at the applicant's expense (the Director shall develop and maintain a list of qualifications and / or certifications that are acceptable to the City for this purpose), and shall: 
a. 	
Review peak parking demand periods for the proposed uses during a 24-hour weekday and each weekend day, and shall propose a required number of parking spaces based on the combined maximum peak hour demand for parking. 

b. 	
Provide data on the following: 

1. 	
The sensitivity of the proposed uses to change. For example, a center with no restaurant could have significant changes in parking if a restaurant was added. 

2. 	
Similar mixes of uses in other areas of the community. 

3. 	
Degree of variability of parking for individual uses (average, range, and standard deviation). 





2. 	The City may require a reserved open area (which shall not be counted as open space) if it finds that the risk of parking needs changing over time so warrants. Once the project is occupied and well established, if there is a surplus of parking, the applicant may petition for additional development capacity and parking using the reserved area. 
D. 	Shared Parking Among Lots. When a shared parking reduction is to be applied to uses on several different lots, the following shall be provided: 
1. 	
A plan that provides for a pedestrian circulation system that connects uses and parking areas, making it easy and convenient to move among uses; and 

2. 	
Recorded easements, approved as to form by the City Attorney, that provide, at a minimum, for: 

a. 	
Cross-access among the parking areas and connections to permit parking by the different uses anywhere in the connected properties; 

b. 	
Allocation of maintenance responsibilities; and 

c. 	
A right of enforcement by the City. 



3. 	
As an alternative to the establishment of an easement, a recorded shared parking agreement may be provided. The agreement shall include provisions indicated in subsection D.2.a., D.2.b., and D.2.c., above, unless otherwise approved by the Director. 


Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.03.06 Parking Credits and Reductions 
A. 	Generally. This section sets out several ways to reduce the number of off-street parking spaces that must be provided, as set out in Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables. If used in conjunction with shared parking (see Section 18.05.03.05, Shared Parking), these reductions may be applied to one type of use to reduce the parking requirement for the use prior to calculating the shared parking reduction. 
B. 	Limitations. 
1. 	
The credits and reductions set out in this Section are not available to uses that base their parking on a special study (see Section 18.05.03.07, Parking Studies), unless the special study's methodology specifically addresses these credits and reductions and determines that they are appropriate. 

2. 	
The credits and reductions set out in subsections F. and G., below shall not be used, alone, together, or in combination with any other standards, to allow a reduction in required parking of more than 15 percent. 


C. 	On-Street Parking Credits. In approved mixed-use developments and complete neighborhoods that provide new on-street parking along internal streets in locations approved by the City Engineer, on-street parking may be credited to particular uses in accordance with the formula: Parking Credit = (Sa x P), where: 
1. 	
Sa = the area of the subject property divided by the area of the mixed-use development (or in the case of complete neighborhoods, the neighborhood activity center); and 

2. 	
P = the total parking that is available on-street in the mixed-use development (or in the case of complete neighborhoods, the neighborhood activity center). 


D. 	Reduction of Parking Requirements for Qualified Affordable Housing Development. The off-street parking requirements for qualified affordable housing developments (see Division 18.16.05, Affordable Housing), are reduced as follows: 
1. 	
For units that are affordable to households that earn more than 60 percent, up to and including 80 percent of the area-wide median income (“AMI”): parking requirements are reduced by 25 percent. 

2. 	
For units that are affordable to households that earn at least 30 percent, up to and including 60 percent of AMI, parking requirements are reduced by 50 percent. 

3. 	
For units that are affordable to households that earn less than 30 percent of AMI, parking requirements are reduced by 75 percent. 



E. 	Reduction of Parking Requirements for Age-Restricted Multifamily Residential Development. The off-street parking requirements for dwelling units may be reduced if the Applicant restricts the occupancy of all the units in the project to persons aged 67 years and older. Reductions shall apply as follows: 
1. 	
Studio, 1 BR, 2 BR, Micro Homes, and Cottages: 1 space per dwelling unit 

2. 	
3+ BR: 2 spaces per dwelling unit 


F. 	Reduction of Parking Requirements by Re-Use for a Beneficial Purpose. Up to five percent of parking spaces that existed on the effective date of this UDC may be converted to other functions, provided that: 
1. 	
The reduction is used to improve the design or overall function of a site with an existing building, and not to maximize the building envelope of a subject property; 

2. 	
The conversion is used to provide an area for: 

a. 	
Bringing the subject property into compliance with disabled parking and / or accessibility requirements; 

b. 	
A screened enclosure for solid waste or recycling bins; 

c. 	
Utility pedestals used for the relocation of overhead utilities underground, provided that the utility providers agree that the best location for the pedestals requires displacement of the parking space or spaces; and / or 

d. 	
Adding landscaped area to a lot which does not conform to the landscape requirements of this UDC. 



3. 	
The reduction does not reduce the amount of parking provided in the lot by more than 10 percent; and 

4. 	
There are no practical alternative locations for the functions that displace the parking spaces. 



G. 	Discretionary Parking Reduction. 
1. 	The Director may allow application of an alternative parking standard, provided that the Director determines the following: 
a. 	
The applicant has demonstrated that either: 

1. 	
Site-specific physical constraints necessitate application of the alternative standard, and such constraints will not allow a reasonable use of the property without application of such alternative standard; or 

2. 	
The alternative standard achieves the intent of the parking standard to the same or greater degree than the parking standard, and results in equivalent or greater benefits to the community as would compliance with the parking standard. 



b. 	
The reduction in the number of required parking spaces is not more than 10 percent. 


2. 	Whenever the Director grants a Discretionary Parking Reduction, the Director shall prepare a written statement of findings based on the above criteria for such action. Such statement shall be placed in the development application file. 

H. 	Redevelopment Corridors. 
1. 	The off-street parking requirements of this Division that apply to development that has with frontage on the following redevelopment corridors, excluding areas zoned DT, may be reduced up to 10 percent. 
a. 	
S.H. 287 (including Buchanan Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, Garfield Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue) from Ranch Acres Drive to 14th Street SE. 

b. 	
Eisenhower Avenue from Namaqua Drive to Boise Avenue. 


2. 	The Director may approve parking reductions of up to 25 percent for development within the redevelopment corridor, if the Director finds that the reduction is appropriate for the use due to: 
a. 	
The location of the subject property; 

b. 	
The availability of sufficient on-street parking and public off-street parking; 

c. 	
Vehicular access to the site and parking area(s); 

d. 	
Pedestrian, bicycle, and transit access to the subject property; 

e. 	
The potential for negative impacts from parking spillover as a result of insufficient off-street parking on the subject property. 




I. 	R3e Reductions. 
1. 	
Parking reductions of up to 25 percent are allowed for property within the R3e zone that is located within the area bounded by U.S. Highway 34 on the north; Boise Avenue on the east; the Big Thompson River on the south; and Taft Avenue on the west. In addition, on-street parking spaces directly adjacent to the subject property may be counted toward off-street parking requirements. 

2. 	
The Director may approve parking reductions of up to 50 percent, if the Director finds that the reduction is appropriate for the use due to: 

a. 	
The location of the subject property; 

b. 	
The availability of sufficient on-street parking and public off-street parking; 

c. 	
Vehicular access to the site and parking area(s); 

d. 	
Pedestrian, bicycle, and transit access to the subject property; 

e. 	
The potential for negative impacts from parking spillover as a result of insufficient off-street parking on the subject property. 




J. 	LEED Credit Reductions. Where Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification is being sought for new buildings, major building renovations, or for existing buildings, and LEED credit is achieved for addressing alternative modes of transportation, the Director may approve a reduction in the number of required parking spaces that corresponds to the reasonably anticipated reduction in parking demand. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.05.03.07 Parking Studies 
A. 	Generally. 
1. 	
Some of the uses that are listed in the tables set out in Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables, have nonlinear or widely varying parking demand characteristics. Accordingly, their parking requirements are listed in the table as “special study.” Required parking for these uses shall be established according to the standards of this Section. 

2. 	
Required parking for uses that are not listed in Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables shall be established according to the standards of this Section. 

3. 	
Special studies may also be submitted to support a request to reduce the number of required parking spaces to less than that set out in Section 18.05.03.03, Parking Requirements Tables, due to the nature of the operations and / or location of a proposed use. Such special studies shall include and support all requested reductions in parking. Further parking credits and reductions that are otherwise available pursuant to Section 18.05.03.05, Shared Parking, and Section 18.05.03.06, Parking Credits and Reductions, shall not be applied when parking reductions are granted pursuant to this Section, unless such reductions are supported by the special study. 


B. 	Special Study Requirements. 
1.

C. 	Abbreviated Special Study Requirements. The analytical requirements set out in Subsection B., above, may be reduced to two functionally comparable uses if: 
1. 	
The uses are located in the City or within five miles of its corporate limits; 

2. 	
The proposed use to which the special study is to be applied has less than 5,000 square feet of floor area; or 

3. 	
The special study is used to justify a reduction in required parking and the requested reduction is 15 percent or less. 



D. 	Approval of Special Study. 
1. 	
The City may rely upon the special study or may request additional information or analysis, including, but not limited to: alternative or new data points, or consideration of additional or alternative factors related to comparability or peak demand, as supported by sound engineering principles. 

2. 	
As a condition of approval of a special study, the City may require that land be reserved or land-banked for additional parking if there is a demonstrably high probability the use could change, resulting in a higher demand for parking. Such additional land shall not be counted as open space. 


Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.05.03.08 Required Loading 
A. 	Generally. Off-street loading areas shall be required for non-residential uses that require goods, merchandise, or equipment to be routinely delivered to or shipped from the subject property. 
B. 	Minimum Required Loading Spaces. Unless additional loading space is necessary to meet the requirements of the use, loading spaces for nonresidential uses (including nonresidential components of mixed-use development) shall be provided as follows: 
1. 	
One off-street loading space for buildings between 5,000 sf. and 20,000 sf.; plus 

2. 	
One additional off-street loading space for each 20,000 sf. or fraction thereof of additional gross floor area in excess of 20,000 sf. 



C. 	DT Zone and Neighborhood Activity Centers. 
1. 	In the DT zone and within the neighborhood activity center of a complete neighborhood, the Director may allow: 
a. 	
Alley loading if the Director finds that: 

1. 	
Off-street loading is impractical; and 

2. 	
Alley access is available and safe; or 



b. 	
Over-the-curb loading if the Director finds that: 

1. 	
Alley loading is unavailable or unsafe; and 

2. 	
Over-the-curb loading will not materially disrupt traffic movements on the street. 




2. 	If the Director allows alley loading or over-the-curb loading pursuant to this subsection, the Director may place 
conditions on the timing and types of vehicles used in order to promote the safe operation of the street or alley. Effective on: 11/20/2018

Division 18.05.04 Parking and Loading Design 
18.05.04.01 General Design Principles 
A. 	Single-Family Detached, Duplex, Multiplex, and Townhome Uses. Single-family detached, duplex, multiplex, or townhome dwelling units may be parked in a manner that permits vehicles to back directly onto one public local street. 
B. 	All Other Uses, Except Extraction and Agricultural Uses. All parking lots (surface or structured) for uses that are not subject to subsection A., above, shall be designed as follows: 
1. 	
Backing and turning movements associated with parking shall not extend into a street, and shall not obstruct or conflict with traffic, either on-site or off-site. 

2. 	
The closest driving distance from the flowline of the street at a point of ingress, to the first parking space or drive aisle intersection that is accessible from that point of ingress, is controlled by the City of Loveland Street Standards, Figure 19-6, Minimum Off-Street Parking Setback Distance. 

3. 	
Parking lots with more than three parking spaces shall: 

a. 	
Be designed and traffic controlled therein so that access to and from a public street requires vehicular traffic to be traveling in a forward direction when entering and exiting from the parking lot; 

b. 	
Include curbs, wheel stops, or other barriers to prevent vehicles from extending beyond the perimeter of the parking lot, and to prevent vehicles from contacting an unprotected wall, fence, or sidewalk; 

c. 	
Be clearly and permanently marked on the parking surface (e.g., stalls shall be located and traffic channelized with painted stripes); and 

d. 	
Be designed using the angles, layout, and dimensions in Section 18.05.04.02, Parking Space and Aisle Standards. 



4. 	
Parking lots shall be designed in accordance with Section 18.08.04.03, Parking Lots. 

5. 	
Parking aisles shall be designed to collect and channel traffic from parking compounds towards points of ingress and egress. 

6. 	
Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided for all off-street parking spaces. 



C. 	Location. Parking is not allowed in a required front setback except on a single-family detached, duplex, townhome, or multiplex residential driveway or parking pad that extends through a front setback. 
D. 	Surfacing. All parking, loading, maneuvering and driving areas shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, or similar permanent material approved by the City. The Director may waive surfacing requirements for extraction and agricultural uses, provided that appropriate dust control measures are in place. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.04.02 Parking Space and Aisle Standards 
A. 	Generally. Parking spaces and access aisles shall be designed according to the standards of this Section. 
B. 	Arrangement. 
1. 	
All parking spaces located across from each other, on the opposite side of a drive lane, shall be located at the same angle to the drive lane, except that parallel parking may be provided on one side of the drive lane in order to enhance disabled access. 

2. 	
Angle parking located on a drive lane with a dead-end is not allowed unless: 

a. 	
The angle of the parking space is 90 degrees to the direction of travel; or 

b. 	
The geometry of the subject property requires such a configuration for an efficient parking layout and the Director determines that the design provides for safe circulation. 




C. 	Compact Car Spaces. 
1. 	
All parking spaces that are designated for compact cars shall be at least eight feet wide and 15 feet long. No reduction in size shall be allowed for vehicles that extend over the sidewalk (see subsection D., below). 

2. 	
Compact car spaces shall be:

D. 	Overhangs. The length of standard parking spaces may be reduced by up to two feet where the adjacent sidewalk or landscape area is protected by a curb and not less than seven feet in width, allowing for vehicle overhang and an unobstructed walkway or landscape area of at least five feet in width. The use of wheel barriers in such locations is prohibited. 
E. 	Enclosed Individual Garages. To count towards parking requirements, individual garage interiors shall be not less 
than 11 feet by 21 feet in dimension. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.05.04.03 Urban Parking Design (DT Zone and Neighborhood Activity Centers) 
A. 	Generally. The intent of this section is to reduce the impact of parking in pedestrian-oriented areas with urban character. The standards of this section apply within the DT zone, and may be applied within neighborhood activity centers in complete neighborhoods. 
B. 	DT Zone (Except Neighborhood Transition Character District) and Neighborhood Activity Centers. The standards of this subsection apply within the DT zone (except in the neighborhood transition character district) and within neighborhood activity centers in complete neighborhoods. 
1. 	Access. Vehicular access to parking lots (surface or structured) shall be from alleys unless the Director determines that such access is infeasible or would create a public safety hazard. In such cases, access shall be provided: 
a. 	
With ingress from a public street and egress into the alley, or if such an arrangement is infeasible or would create a public safety hazard; 

b. 	
With ingress and egress from the street. (See options A, B, and C in Figure 18.05.04.03.A., Urban Parking Access). 

a. 
Parking spaces and drive aisles in surface parking lots shall not be located between the primary elevation of 


Figure 18.05.04.03.A.  
Urban Parking Access  
A  B  C  

 
 
 


the building and the public right-of-way. 
b. 	
Parking lot frontage may not comprise more than 50 percent of any secondary lot frontage facing a public street right-of-way. This standard does not apply to lot frontage on an alley or on a lane that functions as an alley. 

c. 	
Parking lot frontage may not comprise more than 25 percent of the primary lot frontage, with the exception that a drive aisle and a single bay of parking perpendicular to the primary lot frontage is permitted where alley access is not utilized. 


3. 	
Screening. Parking shall be screened from public rights of way, not including alleys, and residential zones or uses as provided in Section 18.08.04.03, Parking Lots. 

4. 	
Pedestrian Facilities. Pedestrian sidewalks at least five feet in width shall connect the parking area to the street. Sidewalks shall provide access to adjacent streets, public spaces, parks, and adjacent developments, when feasible. Front ground floor entrances to residential units shall be connected by a porch and/or walkway to the public sidewalk. 

5. 	
Access Aisle Widths. Access aisle width shall not exceed the minimum required width unless an increase in width is necessary to serve a demonstrated public safety interest. 


C. 	Parking in DT Zone Neighborhood Transition Area. The standards of this subsection apply to development within the neighborhood transition character area, except single-family detached and duplex residential uses. 
1. 	Access. Access shall be provided in one of the following ways: 
a. 	
Where curb cuts from adjoining streets already exist or are required and no alley is present, two-way access to the street will be allowed. 

b. 	
Where curb cuts from adjoining streets already exist or are required, the preferable design is to have vehicular ingress from the public street and egress into an alley. See Figure 18.05.04.03.B., Neighborhood Transition Character Area Parking. 

c. 	
Unless waived by the Director for public safety reasons, vehicular access to lots should be provided through the existing alleys. 


2. 	Location. Parking is not allowed: 
a. 	
Between the front façade and a public street; or 

b. 	
In the side yard setback adjacent to a public street on corner lots (see Figure 18.05.04.03.B., Neighborhood Transition Character Area Parking). 




3. 	
Screening. Parking shall be screened from adjacent residential zones and residential uses by an opaque fence or wall that is six feet in height.

B. 	Relationship to Other Standards of this UDC. The standards set out in Division 18.06.08, Standards for North Cleveland Overlay Zone, and Division 18.06.09, Standards for the Enhanced Corridor Overlay Zone, supersede any conflicting standards in this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.06.02 General Standards for Subdivision Layout 18.06.02.01 Lots 

A. 	Generally. All new lots shall comply with the provisions of this UDC related to their access, dimensions, and area. 
B. 	Relationship to Street. When practical, lot lines shall be at right angles to the street line or at right angles to the tangent of the curve of the street line. 
C. 	Double Frontage Lots. 
1. 	
New double frontage lots shall not be permitted unless vehicular access to the lots meets the applicable City of Loveland Street Standards, and the options that are set out in Section 18.06.02.02, Blocks, cannot reasonably be implemented. 

2. 	
All access restrictions shall be noted on the final plat or development agreement. 


D. 	Access. All new lots shall have direct vehicular access to a public street or alley, except that: 
1. 	
Lots within manufactured home parks or manufactured home subdivisions may take access from private streets; 

2. 	
If a housing cluster is divided into individual lots for each dwelling unit, the access requirement applies to the cluster, and not each individual lot. 


E. 	Minimum Frontage. 
1. 	Residential Lots. The minimum frontage for residential lots shall not be less than 80 percent of the minimum lot width, except that: 
a. 	
Frontage for lots within manufactured home parks or manufactured home subdivisions that take access from private streets is measured along the private street; 

b. 	
If a housing cluster is divided into individual lots for each dwelling unit, the frontage requirement applies to the cluster, and not each individual lot; 

c. 	
The frontage for single family detached lots that take access from a cul-de-sac may be reduced to 30 feet, regardless of the required lot width. 


2. 	Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Lots. The minimum frontages for nonresidential and mixed-use lots are set out in 
Section 18.04.03.01 Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Lot and Building Standards. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.06.02.02 Blocks 
A. 	Generally. All contiguous lots bounded by right-of-way, boundaries of the subject property, or designated or dedicated open space shall be grouped and labeled as distinct blocks. The City may require one or more easements through a block for the purpose of access. 
B. 	Residential Blocks with Arterial or State Highway Frontage. 
1. 	
Generally, the City strongly discourages the use of double frontage residential (except general multifamily and downtown multifamily housing types) lots along arterial frontages, either as a method of restricting vehicular access to those properties or for maximizing the number of lots within a residential subdivision. Along all arterial streets, development design shall allow for homes to face arterial streets, with generous front yard setbacks, and vehicular access being taken from either an alley or local street. The City also encourages the use of cul-de-sacs in conjunction with pocket parks that are adjacent to arterial streets. This arrangement should provide a high degree of visible permeability to residential development and allow for pedestrian and bicycle access, while at the same time limiting auto access along the arterial or state highway. 

2. 	
Where rear yards are allowed along arterials or state highways, buffering shall be provided as required by 


Section 18.08.03.05, Street Bufferyards. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.06.03 Standards for Residential Subdivisions

Recreation areas may include playgrounds with tot lots, plazas, gathering areas with seating and wildlife viewing, community gardens, dog parks, or active hard surface courts. The standards of this Section apply to residential subdivisions that are not complete neighborhoods. For standards that apply to complete neighborhoods, see Division 18.06.04, Standards for Complete Neighborhoods. 
B. 	Minimum Required Outdoor Recreation Area. Outdoor recreation areas are required at a rate of one acre for every 100 dwelling units for residential subdivisions containing 50 or more residential dwelling units. 
C. 	Design. Outdoor recreation areas shall be of suitable size, dimension, topography, and general character for the particular purpose of providing adequate space within the development for outdoor recreational activities. The recreation areas shall be integrated into the development design to create meaningful areas within a reasonable distance of the maximum number of residential dwelling units, as well as to provide visibility, and where practicable, views to the mountains or other landmarks from public rights-of-way. The recreation areas shall be connected by walkways that emphasize and place priority on pedestrian movement. The minimum dimension of an outdoor recreation area shall be 50 feet. Small, odd, “left-over” open space areas, areas within street bufferyards, detention pond two-year storm inundation areas, and areas isolated in corners of the development shall not be included in outdoor recreation areas. 
D. 	Maintenance. Outdoor recreation areas shall be maintained by a property owners’ association and shall have no 
effect on the amount of capital expansion fees otherwise imposed under Division 18.16.04, Capital Expansion Fees. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.06.04 Standards for Complete Neighborhoods 
18.06.04.01 Purpose and Application of Division; General Requirements for Pattern Books 
A. 	Generally. A Complete Neighborhood is a community that may include a variety of housing types and densities at a variety of price points. A Complete Neighborhood may also include prominently sited civic or community buildings, public open spaces, and neighborhood activity centers including stores, offices, entertainment, and services. Schools and other public facilities may also be included in a Complete Neighborhoods. Complete neighborhoods provide a balanced mix of activities in close proximity to each other and have a recognizable center (or centers). Edges of the community are clearly defined and integrate land uses that appropriately transition to adjacent development. Wide detached sidewalks with amenities like benches, planters, and gathering places are provided throughout the neighborhood. Streets are designed to be comfortable for bicycling with slow vehicle speeds and bicycle lanes on collectors. 
B. 	Purpose. 
1. 	The purpose of the Complete Neighborhood is to implement the goals set out in Create Loveland, the Comprehensive Plan, which include: 
a. 	
promoting a mix of land uses that includes high-density residential, commercial, employment, and civic uses; 

b. 	
promoting high quality architecture; 

c. 	
maximizing transit investment and transit readiness; 

d. 	
encouraging places for neighborhood activity; and 

e. 	
creating a highly connected multimodal transportation network. 


2. 	The purpose of this Division is to promote (but not to require) the development of high quality Complete Neighborhoods in the City’s residential, mixed-use activity center, and employment zones. The standards of this Division apply if an applicant chooses to develop a subject property as a Complete Neighborhood. 
C. 	Zones in Which Complete Neighborhoods May Be Developed. An application for a Complete Neighborhood may be submitted only for development within the ER, R1, R1e, R2, R3, R3e, MAC, and E Zones.

E. 	
Application. A pattern book for a Complete Neighborhood is a design guide that addresses the design of the individual buildings, the relationship among buildings, streets, and public spaces, the cross-sections of streets, and other defining features of the development. A pattern book provides the following: 

1. 	
A palette of housing types, architectural themes and styles, and finish materials (as such, it addresses the design elements, not the density or intensity of development); 

2. 	
Generalized street cross-sections, streetscape design, and landscaping parameters; and 



3. 
May propose standards different than in the UDC, including housing types. Effective on: 11/20/2018

C. 	Maximum Land Area for Nonresidential Uses. Complete neighborhoods may include non-residential uses as provided in Division 18.02.03, Land Use by Zone. The total land area designated for nonresidential uses (except vertically mixed-use buildings with residential uses on upper floors, parks, outdoor recreation, schools, and places of assembly) shall not exceed 20 percent of the land area of the complete neighborhood. 
D. 	Spatial Mix of Housing Types. Complete Neighborhoods shall be designed as integrated places in which housing types are mixed in a manner that does not create areas containing a single type. Such designs may include lessening of density from a point of high density near a neighborhood activity center to areas of lower density, mixing of housing types on a single block, and other comparable techniques to create an integrated mix of housing types. See Figure 18.06.04.03, Spatial Mix of Housing Types. 

Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.06.04.04 Neighborhood Design 
A. 	Generally. Complete Neighborhoods shall be designed as provided in this Section. 
B. 	Layout of Complete Neighborhood. The layout of the complete neighborhood shall be shown on a sketch plat or sketch site plan. The sketch plat or sketch site plan shall include areas designated for each housing type (or areas designated for particular mixes of housing types), and if nonresidential uses other than parks, outdoor recreation, schools, or places of assembly will be included in the neighborhood, it shall also include areas designated as neighborhood activity centers. 
C. 	Blocks. 
1. 	
Arrangement. Blocks shall be arranged in a grid-like pattern to ensure connectivity and alternate travel routes within the complete neighborhood; cul-de-sacs shall be limited to locations where they are demonstrated to be necessary due to site constraints, or where their use improves non-vehicular connectivity. A strict grid pattern is not required. 

2. 	
Maximum Block Length. 

a. 	
Block lengths shall not exceed: 

1.

Blocks that include single-family not listed in subsection C.2.a.2.: 800 ft. 



b. 	
Blocks that include parks, outdoor recreation, schools, or places of assembly shall not be limited by the standards of this subsection C.2. 

c. 	
The Director may authorize modifications from the maximum block length requirements if it is demonstrated that the modified blocks offer comparable connectivity within the neighborhood, and between the neighborhood and nearby transit, parks, outdoor recreation facilities, schools, and places of assembly. The Director may require pedestrian and bicycle access mid-block for block lengths greater than 800 ft. 




D. 	Off-Street Circulation. 
1. 	
A network of sidewalks, off-street trails, or multi-use paths shall be integrated into the design of the Complete Neighborhood to enhance access to and through parks, outdoor recreation areas, schools, places of assembly, and neighborhood activity centers and to connect to existing or planned sidewalk, trail, or multi-use path systems in the City. 

2. 	
The network of sidewalks, off-street trails, or multi-use paths shall be consistent with the objectives of Complete Streets. 

3. 	
In residential areas, sidewalks shall be detached and not less than six feet in width. 

4. 	
In Complete Neighborhoods that include cul-de-sacs, the Director may require that the pedestrian circulation system include connections between cul-de-sac ends and streets or other cul-de-sac ends within 250 feet. 


E. 	Common Open Space and Recreation. 
1. 	Open Space. 
a. 	
Generally, open spaces are integrated into the development design to create meaningful areas of useable open space within a reasonable distance of the maximum number of residential properties, as well as to provide visibility, and where practicable, views to the mountains or other landmarks from public rights-of-way. Site design shall minimize or eliminate small, odd, “left-over” open space areas, except where necessary for the stormwater system. The Director may require extra landscaping to enhance the aesthetic or ecological value of such spaces where they cannot be avoided. 

b. 	
Where possible, open space shall be designed to provide greenways along drainage corridors and streams. The landscaping along corridors or streams shall be designed to enhance water quality of surface and subsurface water flows. Where feasible, trails shall be provided along greenways to provide access for residents of the proposed development. Greenways, trails, and landscaping shall be located outside of the 



rights-of-way of irrigation ditches, unless the ditch company provides an easement for such greenways, trails, or landscaping. 
c. 	
Common open spaces shall be designed to provide areas of visual focus, recreation, or public assembly within the Complete Neighborhood. Landscaping and furniture for pedestrians is included in these areas to enhance functionality. 

d. 	
Open spaces shall be protected by appropriate easements, dedications, or plat notations. 


2. 	Accessibility of Recreation Areas. In the R1e, R2, R3e, R3, MAC, and E zones, parks and outdoor recreation opportunities shall be provided such that 90 percent of the dwelling units in the Complete Neighborhood are located within a one-quarter mile walk of an outdoor recreation area. For the purpose of this standard, a plaza with features that provide recreational opportunities (e.g., interactive fountain or sculpture, tot lot, etc.) shall be included in the definition of outdoor recreation area. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018

2. 	
Vehicular access is provided from an alley or parking court; 

3. 	
The modified setback does not allow an encroachment upon an easement or a required view triangle at a street intersection; and 

4. 	
A combination of street trees, yard landscaping, open space, street furniture, or other pedestrian oriented amenities compensates for the loss of the front yard. 


C. 	Modification of Side Setbacks. Side setbacks (interior or street) may be modified if the pattern book demonstrates that: 
1. 	
The buildings will comply with applicable building and fire codes; 

2.

The purposes of the landscaping standards that are set out in this Chapter are to: 
A. 	Preserve, protect, and enhance the character of the City by: 
1. 	
Ensuring that development in the City has a balance of buildings, paved areas, and landscaping that is consistent with the intended character of the zone in which the development is located; 

2. 	
Buffering uses that tend to diminish the appearance of the community; and 

3. 	
Creating well-landscaped, high-quality views along streets. 



B. 	Encourage non-vehicular modes of travel by: 
1. 	
Creating deciduous tree-lined streets that offer shelter in summer months and solar access in winter months; and 

2. 	
Enhancing the experience of the pedestrian. 


C. 	Preserve, protect, and enhance the environmental quality of the City by: 
1. 	
Using landscape materials to clean the air, slow runoff, and prevent soil erosion by wind and water; 

2. 	
Reducing the "heat island" effect that is created by large areas of exposed pavement; 

3. 	
Promoting landscape designs that conserve energy and water resources; 

4. 	
Preserving or replacing native grasses, valuable mature trees, and other desirable vegetative cover. 


D.

2. 	
Buffering certain land uses from each other; and 



3. 
Landscaping parking lots and open space areas. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.08.01.02 Application of Chapter 
A. 	Calculations. Division 18.08.02, Calculation of Landscape Requirements sets out the standards for calculating the landscape requirements of this Chapter. 
B. 	Bufferyards. Division 18.08.03, Standards for Bufferyards, sets out types, dimensions, and planting requirements for different types of bufferyards that are required by this UDC, and authorizes the Director to allow variations from those standards in certain circumstances. 
C. 	Other Landscape Areas. Division 18.08.04, Standards for Landscape Areas, sets out standards for street trees, plazas, parking lots, and certain other interior portions of a subject property. 
D. 	Tree Preservation and Protection. Division 18.08.05, Tree Preservation and Protection, sets out standards for preserving certain trees on-site, and for protecting trees that are designated for preservation. 
E. 	Installation, Maintenance, and Warranties. Division 18.08.06, Landscape Elements, Maintenance, and Warranties, sets out standards for how landscaping is to be installed, maintained, and warrantied. 
F. 	Sight Triangles. The standards of this Chapter shall be implemented in a manner that complies with Section 
18.05.02.02, Sight Triangles. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.08.02 Calculation of Landscape Requirements 
18.08.02.01 Approved and Prohibited Plant Lists 
A. 	Generally. Only those plants on the approved plant list may be used to meet the standards of this Chapter. Plants on the prohibited plant list shall not be installed, and the City may require their removal as a condition of development approval. Applicants may request that plants which are not listed be included on the approved plant list, and the Director may add them according to the standards in subsection B.3., below. Plants that are on neither the approved plant list nor the prohibited plant list may be installed, but are not counted towards compliance with this Chapter. 
B. 	Approved Plant List. 
1. 	The Director shall maintain a list of approved plants in the following categories: 
a. 	
Street Trees (deciduous trees with a mature height that is generally more than 35 feet, planted between the street side curb and the sidewalk, typically in the public right-of-way); 

b. 	
Large Trees (deciduous trees with a mature height that is generally more than 35 feet); 

c. 	
Small Trees (deciduous trees with a mature height that is generally 35 feet or less); 

d. 	
Evergreen Trees (conifers or other evergreens with a mature height of more than 20 feet); and 

e. 	
Shrubs (perennials or evergreens with a mature height of at least three feet). 



2. 	The Director may further classify the approved plant list according to: 
a. 	
Locations where approved plants are appropriate or not appropriate (e.g., street tree species may be identified, etc.); and 

b. 	
Level of water usage (e.g., identification of species which may be used to meet the requirements of Section 18.08.02.07, Water-Wise Landscaping Requirement, and Section 18.08.02.08, Irrigation Subject to Hydrozone Water Budget). 


3. 	The Director may modify the approved plant list on his or her own initiative or in response to requests. Plants may be added to the list if the Director finds that they are appropriate for planting in the City (or in certain locations, see subsection B.2., above)), in consideration of: 
a. 	
Climate zone; 

b. 	
Growth habits; 

c. 	
Invasiveness; 

d. 	
Lifespan; 

e. 	
Habitat; 

f. 	
Hardiness (resistance to disease and harmful insects); 

g. 	
Leaf litter; 

h. 	
Structural strength; and 

i. 	
Watering needs / drought tolerance. 


4. 	The Director may approve proposed plantings that are not on the approved plant list for use in a specific development, in order to determine their suitability for use in the City. Such plantings will be counted as “approved plants” for the purposes of the proposed development’s compliance with the standards of this Chapter. 
C. 	
Prohibited Plant List. The following plants are not allowed in the City, and shall be removed during development or redevelopment if they are present on the subject property: 

1. 	Plants that are identified as noxious, invasive, or prohibited in Loveland by the United States or the State of Colorado; and 

2. 
Plants that are identified on the City’s list of prohibited plants, which is maintained by the Director. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.08.02.02 Substitution of Plant Types 
A. 	Generally. The planting requirements of this Chapter are expressed in terms of the number of large trees, small trees, evergreens, and shrubs that must be planted within a specific area. In some circumstances, it may not be practicable to plant the specified types of vegetation. In those cases, the Director may allow substitutions as provided in this Section. 
B. 	Use of Equivalent Plant Types. The Director may allow the substitution of required plants for other plant types, if the Director finds that: 
1. 	
The substitution will improve the buffering qualities of the bufferyard, given the nature of the use to be buffered; 

2. 	
The substitution is justified by the habits (forms) of the proposed plantings, in that it will provide for adequate space for the trees to grow to maturity, and will not compromise the buffering effect of the bufferyard; and 

3. 	
Unique conditions of the site (e.g., soil conditions, overhead power lines, solar orientation) justify the 



substitution. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.02.03 Tree Preservation Credits 
A. 	Generally. Existing trees that are protected on a subject property, excluding existing, individual residential lots, count towards the planting requirements of this Chapter, provided that: 
1. 	They are either: 
a. 	
On the approved plant list; or 

b. 	
Established for at least five years and not on the prohibited plant list; and 


2. 	They are not: 
a. 	
Overmature; 

b. 	
Diseased; 

c. 	
Poor in form; 

d. 	
Leaning heavily over buildings; 

e. 	
Too close to building foundations; 

f. 	
Damaging sidewalks and driveways; or 

g. 	
Impacting utilities. 


B. 	Credit for Preservation of Trees. Healthy, mature trees that are preserved on-site may count as more than one tree for the purposes of the landscaping requirements, as set out in Table 18.08.02.03, Tree Preservation Credits. 
Table 18.08.02.03 Tree Preservation Credits

Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.02.04 Identification of Landscape Areas 
A. 	Generally. This Section sets out several different areas of a subject property in which specific quantities or techniques of landscaping may be required. 
B. 	Identification of Landscape Areas in All Development Types. 
1. 	
Bufferyards. Bufferyards are areas of a subject property that must be used for buffering the subject property from adjoining lots, parcels, or public rights-of-way. Bufferyards are generally situated along (or close to) property lines, outside of the public right-of-way. 

2. 	
Street Tree Lawns. Street tree lawns are areas of a subject property or adjoining right-of-way that are used for the planting of street trees. This landscape area may or may not be a part of the subject property. 

3. 	
Parking Lot Landscape Areas. Parking lot landscape areas are those areas within surface parking lots that must be landscaped. Parking areas are delineated to include access aisles and off-street parking spaces, and any corners that are necessary to give the parking area a relatively regular shape, except: 

a. 	
Corners and other landscape areas that bound access points (the areas used for ingress / egress stacking at connections to streets). 

b. 	
Parking in service areas that are hidden by screen walls; and 

c. 	
Individual driveways that provide access to single-family detached, duplex, townhome, or multiplex development. 



4. 	
Foundation Plantings. Planting beds adjacent to buildings are not required, but are encouraged to add a natural element to building elevations. Such planting beds shall be given credit toward meeting open space standards in the UDC. Plant material in planting beds shall be low water usage plants, with drip irrigation. 

5. 	
Protected Open Spaces. Protected open spaces are the areas of a subject property that meet the definition of open space and which are subject to an easement or dedication that restricts future development to open space uses. 



C. 	Landscape Areas in Single-Family Detached, Duplex, Townhome, and Multiplex Development. 
1. 	
Private Lots. Private lot landscape areas are the yards on lots that are intended for individual ownership, or, in the case of common maintenance communities or condominiums, areas around dwelling units that would be located within private lots if the subdivision were platted for fee-simple ownership. 

2. 	
Common Landscape Areas. Common landscape areas are those areas of land within a subject property that are either owned by a property owners' association or dedicated to the City or another governmental or non-profit entity for the purpose of maintaining the areas in their natural or landscaped condition. Bufferyards, street tree lawns along new streets, open stormwater detention or retention facilities, recreation areas, and protected open spaces may be components of the common landscape area. 


D. 	Landscape Areas in Multifamily, Mixed-Use, and Nonresidential Development. 
1. 	General Landscape Area. General landscape areas are those areas of a subject property that are required to be landscaped or designated as open space. They may be privately owned, owned by a property owners' association, or dedicated to the City or another governmental or non-profit entity for the purpose of maintaining the areas in their natural or landscaped condition. Bufferyards, street tree lawns along new streets, protected open spaces, open stormwater retention and detention facilities, foundation landscape areas, recreation areas, and parking lot landscape areas are components of the general landscape area. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.02.05 Size and Quality of Landscape Plants 
A. 	Generally. In general, plant materials that are installed according to the requirements of this Chapter shall meet the standards that are set out in this Section. However, larger sizes may be required to ensure survival or to implement a condition of approval of a limited or conditional use. 
B. 	Minimum Size of Landscape Materials. The minimum sizes of landscape materials used to satisfy the requirements of this Chapter are set out in Table 18.08.02.05, Minimum Size of Landscape Materials. 
Table 18.08.02.05 Minimum Size of Landscape Materials  
Type of Plant Material  Minimum Caliper, Height, or Container Size  
Large Trees and Street Trees  2 in. Caliper  
Small Trees  1.5 in. Caliper  
Evergreen Trees  6 ft. Height

Table 18.08.02.05 Minimum Size of Landscape Materials  
Type of Plant Material  Minimum Caliper, Height, or Container Size  
If used in bufferyards, estimated growth to 3 ft. in height within 3 years  

C. 	Specification of Landscape Materials. 
1. 	
All new plant material shall meet specifications of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1) and 8 CCR § 1203-5, Rules Pertaining to the Administration and Enforcement of the Colorado Nursery Act. 

2. 	
Plant materials shall be true to name and type, and first class representatives of their species or varieties. 

3. 	
Trees shall be balled and burlapped, with the burlap wrapped in a metal wire basket. Container and bare root 


tree plantings are not permitted without the written permission of the Director upon good cause shown. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.02.06 Required Biodiversity 
A. 	Generally. Diversity of the genus and species of trees and shrubs is required in order to prevent monocultures which could result in large-scale losses in the event of disease or blight. 
B. 	
Standards. 

1. 	
Within each category of required landscape plants (i.e., large trees, small trees, evergreens, and shrubs), not more than 30 percent shall be of any one genus. 

2. 	
Each street frontage where at least six street trees are required shall include at least three genera of street trees. For the purpose of this paragraph only, street trees shall include all trees that are planted within 10 feet of the public street right-of-way. 

3. 	
No more than six trees of one genus may be located within an individual cluster of trees on the subject property, with such clusters separated from each other such that the driplines of trees in different clusters are at least 100 feet apart. 



4. 
Exceptions may be made with written permission of the Director upon good cause shown. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.08.02.07 Water-Wise Landscaping Requirement 
A. 	Generally. The requirements of this Section are applied to all landscaped areas within a subject property. 
B. 	Plant Selection and Grouping Requirements. 
1. 	
Plants shall be selected based on their suitability for the site. Where possible, native species shall be installed, protected, or preserved. 

2. 	
Not more than 50 percent of the trees and shrubs that are installed to meet the requirements of this Chapter shall be classified as high water use. Plants or trees that produce food for human consumption are not counted in this calculation. 

3. 	
Low water use plants (including grasses) are allowed in any location, but are required: 

a. 	
On slopes that are steeper than 25 percent; and 

b. 	
In areas that the Director determines are not appropriate for permanent irrigation (unless such areas are characterized by hydric soils). 




C. 	Mulch. Mulch, such as bark, stone, or other materials, left loose, or other water-saving treatments applied to the soil surface at a depth of four inches for bark, or two to four inches for stone, shall be used for all planting areas (except turf areas) in order to help maintain soil moisture and inhibit weeds. Landscape fabric is required below non-organic materials. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.08.02.08 Irrigation Subject to Hydrozone Water Budget 
A. 	Generally. The City provides cost-saving incentives for the implementation of a hydrozone landscape plan, for new landscapes, redeveloped landscapes, and retrofits to existing landscapes. Participation in the hydrozone landscape plan incentive program is voluntary. 
B. 	Relationship to Water Budget Program. Submittal of a qualifying hydrozone landscape plan is a requirement of the City’s voluntary water budget program that is designed to protect the City’s water resources by encouraging the design, installation, and maintenance of hydrozone landscapes in which plantings are grouped by hydrozone and are subject to an annual water budget. See Chapter 19.06, Loveland Municipal Code. 
C. 	Applications. 
1. 	
Hydrozone landscape plans shall be designed for and secure a dedicated irrigation meter (under provisions established by the City’s Water Division) that provides irrigation water to landscape areas governed by the program. 

2. 	
Hydrozone landscape plans shall be provided as a component of standard landscape plan submittals. 


D. 	Plan and Hydrozone Standards. A complete and appropriately detailed landscape plan and irrigation plan shall demonstrate compliance with the standards of this Chapter and this Section. 
1. 	
Landscape and irrigation plans must satisfy standards specified by this Division, including soil amendment requirements and landscape / irrigation design requirements. Landscape plans shall clearly demonstrate compliance with program requirements, including the identification of hydrozones, specification of plant lists with Evapo-Transpiration (“ET”) or Kc-values and indication of plant spacing. 

2. 	
Planting areas must be organized into distinct hydrozones according to their microclimatic needs and water requirements. Plants with similar water usage shall be grouped into distinct hydrozones. High water use hydrozones shall be separated from low and very low water use hydrozones by moderate water use hydrozones whenever possible. 

3. 	
A water budget that is based on submitted landscape and irrigation plans must demonstrate the requirements of Chapter 19.06.050.F.1, Loveland Municipal Code. 

4. 	
Irrigation system design shall be based on a maximum irrigation period (window) of not more than 16 hours of operation per day, excluding subsurface irrigation of trees, shrubs, and other plantings. 

5. 	
Irrigation systems shall be provided with automatic rainfall shut-offs to limit the unnecessary application of irrigation water. 

6. 	
ET irrigation system controllers (or similar controllers) may be utilized to ensure that irrgation water is provided efficiently based on the moisture needs of landscape plantings. 

7. 	
Landscape and irrigation system design and operation shall comply with requirements specified in Chapter 19.06, Loveland Municipal Code. 


E. 	Preparation of Plans. Unless waived by the Director for good cause shown, irrigation plans shall be prepared and signed by a Professional Engineer, Landscape Architect, or by a designer that is certified by the Association of Landscape Contractors of Colorado (CLT-E Certification), the Irrigation Association (CID Certification), or similar certifying program approved by the Director. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.08.03 Standards for Bufferyards 
18.08.03.01 Purpose and General Design Parameters for Bufferyards 
A. 	Purposes of Bufferyards. Bufferyards are used to beautify street edges, soften the visual interaction between differing zones, improve compatibility of adjoining uses, and protect natural resources from impacts of nearby development. 
B. 	Opacity and Width Standards. 

1. 	Classes of Bufferyards. This Chapter describes five classes of bufferyards: A, B, C, D, and E. The relative opacity of the bufferyards (see subsection B.2., below) increases in alphabetical order. This Chapter also describes three special purpose bufferyards: 
a. 	
Zone Boundary Bufferyard; 

b. 	
Street Bufferyard; and 

c. 	
Parking Bufferyard. 


2. 	
Opacity Standards. The opacity of the bufferyard is a measure of the rough proportion of the view that is blocked by the bufferyard (at maturity) from grade to 35 feet above grade. Opacity is related to planting density, plant forms, bufferyard widths, and the presence of structures (e.g., fences and walls) or topographical features (e.g., natural slopes or constructed berms). 

3. 	
Width Standards. Comparable opacities can be achieved with bufferyards of different widths. However, in certain circumstances (e.g., where noise, dust, runoff, or other non-visual impacts are to be mitigated by the bufferyard), the width of the bufferyard may be as important or more important than its opacity. Where bufferyard widths are specified by limited, adaptable, or conditional use standards, alternatives with narrower widths are not allowed. 


C. 	Bufferyard Design. Section 18.08.03.02, Bufferyard Specifications, sets out standard bufferyard widths and planting requirements for each class of bufferyard. 
D. 	Bufferyard Requirements. 
1. 	
Bufferyards may be required for certain land uses in certain zones or locations, based on applicable limited, adaptable, or conditional use standards. See Division 18.02.04, Use Standards. 

2. 	
Bufferyards are required along zone boundaries as set out in Section 18.08.03.04, Zone Boundary Bufferyards. 

3. 	
Bufferyards are required along certain streets, as set out in Section 18.08.03.05, Street Bufferyards. 


E. 	Nonconforming Bufferyards. Nonconforming bufferyards shall comply with Section 18.11.05.01, Uses Proposed on 
Sites with Physical Nonconformities. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.03.02 Bufferyard Specifications 
A. 	Generally. Bufferyard specifications are set out in Table 18.08.03.02, Bufferyard Specifications. The table includes two alternative configurations; one with landscaping only (“standard bufferyards”), and one with berms, fences, or walls (“constrained bufferyards”). Fences and walls shall meet the standards set out in Section 18.04.07.05, Fences, Garden Walls, and Hedges.

TABLE NOTES: 1 Shrubs must be planted on the outside of any wall or fence 2 For the purposes of compliance with this Section, wall or fence height is measured from the elevation of the property line against which the bufferyard is installed. A berm may be used to increase the elevation and thereby reduce the height of the wall or fence. Berms shall be planted with slopes no greater than 4 feet of run per foot of rise.  

B. 	Location of Plantings in Relation to Walls and Fences. 
1. 	
Walls or Fences that are Installed along Streets. Walls or fences that are installed along streets shall be installed along the inside boundary of the bufferyard, with landscaping installed between the wall or fence and the property line. Walls and fences shall not be located less than 15 feet from the property line. The Director may authorize an alternative location or meandering wall if all required plantings are planted on the street side of the wall and the wall or fence height is not greater than three feet, or a constrained bufferyard is approved by the Director in compliance with Section 18.08.03.03, Use of Constrained Bufferyards. 

2. 	
Walls or Fences that are Installed along Other Interior Property Lines. Along interior property lines that are not specified in subsection B.1., above, walls and fences may be installed at the property line, provided that: 

a. 	
The decorative sides of walls or fences face out, with structural members facing the interior of the subject property; and 

b. 	
Shrubs required as part of a bufferyard are exchanged for materials with a mature height of more than 125 percent of the wall height, unless: 

1. 	
Such landscaping would conflict with existing overhead utilities; or 

2. 	
The inside of the wall is highly visible from an arterial or collector street. 






C. 	Existing Walls. Existing walls may be counted towards the bufferyard requirements if they are of sound construction and in good repair. However, if more than one wall is installed in adjoining bufferyards, only the tallest of the walls is counted towards the overall opacity of the combined bufferyard. Fences and walls in adjoining bufferyards shall not be located closer than 10 feet to each other. 
D. 	Noise Barriers. Where a bufferyard specification requires a noise barrier, the bufferyard shall include a barrier that reflects or absorbs noise generated from the subject property to the extent necessary to attenuate noise on adjoining property to comply with the noise standards set forth in Division 18.09.05, Noise and Ground Vibration. 
E. 	Use of Equivalent Plant Materials. The number of large trees, small trees, evergreens, and shrubs may be modified 
in a particular bufferyard as set out in Section 18.08.02.02, Substitution of Plant Types. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.03.03 Use of Constrained Bufferyards 
Constrained bufferyards (as described in Section 18.08.03.02, Bufferyard Specifications) are allowed if compliance with all bufferyard requirements would result in more than 15 percent of a subject property being required for use as bufferyards, or if the Director determines that it is impractical to meet the required bufferyard standards due to specific site constraints, which may include the locations of existing buildings and parking areas. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.03.04 Zone Boundary Bufferyards 

A. 	Generally. Bufferyards are required along certain zone boundaries that are also boundaries of the subject property (or within the subject property), except street frontages. The required classification of bufferyard at each boundary is as set out in Table 18.08.03.04, Zone Boundary Bufferyards (the letter in each cell corresponds to the class of bufferyard that is defined in Section 18.08.03.02, Bufferyard Specifications). Limited, adaptable, or conditional use standards or conditions may impose additional requirements in certain circumstances.

B. 	Bufferyards Adjacent to Other Zones. The classification of bufferyards adjacent to a Planned Unit Development or property not within the City's jurisdiction shall be established by the Director based on the land uses in the PUD. 
C. 	Waiver of Zone Boundary Bufferyards. Where a zone boundary separates land uses that are allowable in both 
zones, the Director may waive zone boundary bufferyards. Use-specific bufferyards, if applicable, still apply. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.08.03.05 Street Bufferyards 
A. 	Generally. Street bufferyards shall be installed along state highways, arterials, collectors, local commercial / industrial, and local residential (public or private) streets as provided in this Section, except that landscaping shall be provided: 
1.

Division 18.11.02 Nonconforming Uses 
Division 18.11.03 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures 
Division 18.11.04 Nonconforming Signs 

Division 18.11.01 Purpose and Application 
18.11.01.01 Purpose of Chapter 
A. 	Generally. The application of new regulations to existing development may create circumstances in which existing lot dimensions, density, intensity, land uses, buildings, structures, landscaping and buffering, lighting, parking areas, or signs do not strictly conform to the requirements of the new regulations. For existing lots or development (including uses, buildings, structures, and signs) that are legally nonconforming to the standards in the UDC, this Chapter sets out equitable rules for whether, when, and how the regulations of this UDC apply. 
B. 	Conversion of Nonconformities. Generally, nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and signs are not allowed to be enlarged, expanded, increased, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses that are now prohibited in the same zone. This Chapter provides standards by which nonconforming uses can be made conforming through a public hearing process. 
C. 	Reduction of Nonconformities. It is the policy of the City to encourage reinvestments in property that increase its value and utility and reduce its external impacts. Since bringing a developed property into full compliance with this UDC may involve substantial costs that may discourage reinvestment, this Chapter provides certain thresholds and priorities for determining when new construction or modifications to development implicate a requirement for increasing conformity with the various requirements of this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.01.02 Application of Chapter 
A. 	Generally. This Chapter applies to uses, buildings, structures, landscaping, buffering, signs, lighting, parking, density, and lots that were: 

1. 
Lawfully established, constructed, installed, platted, or created prior to the effective date, but do not conform to 

the requirements of, this UDC; or 

2. 	
Lawfully established, constructed, installed, platted, or created in one zone, but no longer conform to the requirements of this UDC after the subject property is rezoned. 


B. 	Effect of Chapter. Nothing in this Chapter shall be interpreted to require a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building in which a building permit was lawfully obtained from the City prior to the effective date of this UDC or subsequent amendment, provided that construction: 
1. 	
Was commenced before the expiration of the building permit; and 

2. 	
Work is proceeding diligently toward completion. 


C. 	Changes of Ownership. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to affect or restrict changes in ownership, nor shall changes in ownership affect the application of any of the requirements of this Chapter. 
D. 	Evidence of Status. Evidence that a nonconforming situation is a legal nonconformity and not a violation of this UDC shall be submitted by the owner of the property or use upon request of the Director. 
E. 	Exceptions to Chapter. 
1. 	
R1e, R1, R2, R3e, and R3 Zones. Lots of record within the R1e, R1, R2, R3e, and R3 zones regardless of their size, and existing buildings on said lots of record, are deemed to be conforming lots and conforming buildings, respectively. To the extent they are used for single-family detached residential purposes, they are also deemed to be conforming density. 

2. 	
DT Zone. Lots of record within the DT zone, regardless of their size, and existing buildings on said lots of record, and existing uses in said buildings, are deemed to be conforming lots, conforming buildings, and conforming uses, respectively. 

3. 	
Partitions. Lots that are created by judicial partition are deemed to be conforming lots. 

4. 	
Vested Rights. This Chapter does not apply to site-specific development plans for which rights are vested, during the period of vested rights. 

5. 	
Natural Shifts of Zone Boundaries. If a zone boundary changes as a result of a change in location of a river, stream, or ditch channel centerline, other natural boundary-defining feature, or street, such change of zone boundary does not render existing development nonconforming. 

6. 	
Taking for Public Use. Any nonconforming building, structure, parking, or lot that is expressly created or caused by a conveyance of privately-owned land to a Federal, State, or local government to serve a public purpose is conforming for the purposes of this UDC, and is not subject to limitations in this Chapter. This exemption applies in cases where private land is obtained by a governmental entity for a public purpose, through condemnation, threat of condemnation, or otherwise, when that transaction would otherwise create a nonconformity in the remainder parcel in terms of setback, lot area, or other standards of this UDC. However, this exemption does not apply to right-of-way dedication or other public conveyances of land required by the City in the course of subdivision, site plan, or other development approvals. 


F. 	Unlawful Uses, Buildings, or Structures. This Chapter does not allow for the perpetuation of unlawful development. Such development is not legally nonconforming, but instead, unlawful, and is subject to all of the provisions of this UDC (including enforcement provisions) and any other applicable law. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.11.02 Nonconforming Uses 
18.11.02.01 Continuation of Nonconforming Use 

Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, a nonconforming use may be continued and maintained in reasonable repair, and may be expanded, cumulatively, by up 25 percent of its footprint on the effective date of this UDC, provided that such expansion does not create additional physical nonconformity. For the purposes of this Section, the extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of an existing building or structure that was designed and constructed for the nonconforming use at the time of adoption of this UDC is not an extension of a nonconforming use. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.02.02 Change of Nonconforming Use 
If a nonconforming use is changed to a different use, the new use shall be a use that conforms to the regulations of the zone in which the use is located. After such change, all future use of the subject property shall comply with applicable use-related provisions of this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.02.03 Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use 
A. 	Nonconforming Uses that Involve Buildings or Structures. If a nonconforming use involving a building or structure is discontinued from use for a period of 12 months, further use of the subject property shall conform to the requirements of this UDC. 
B. 	Nonconforming Uses that Do Not Involve Buildings or Structures. If a nonconforming use not involving a building or structure is discontinued for a period of six months, further use of the subject property shall conform to the requirements of this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.02.04 Conversion of a Nonconforming Use to a Conforming Use 
A. 	Generally. In many instances, nonconforming uses may be integral parts of the City’s fabric, that is, its character and function, so their continuing existence promotes the City’s policy of retaining existing businesses or protecting its character and neighborhoods. In these instances, the classification nonconforming use and resulting restriction on investment may not be what the community desires. As such, a nonconforming use may be made conforming pursuant to this Section in order to remove the potential stigma associated with the nonconforming designation. 
B. 	Limitation. Unlawful uses may not be made conforming under this Section. 
C. 	Conversion by Conditional Use Approval; Standards. A conditional use approval may be granted to make a nonconforming use conforming, if: 
1. 	
The criteria for approval of a conditional use set forth in Section 18.02.04.14, General Standards for Conditional Uses, are met; and 

2. 	
The use has minimal nonconformities and has been integrated into the function of its surrounding neighborhood or zone, as evidenced by the following: 

a. 	
Nearby City residents regularly patronize the use or are employed by the use (for nonresidential uses in or abutting residential neighborhoods). 

b. 	
Management practices eliminate nuisances such as: 

1. 	
Spillover of noise or light; 

2. 	
Odors and appearance of waste materials and litter; 

3. 	
Unreasonably congested on-street parking; or 

4. 	
Comparable conflicts with abutting and nearby properties. 



c. 	
There is no material history of complaints about the use (a history of complaints is justification for denying the conditional use permit, unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the sources of the complaints). 

d. 	
If the use is nonresidential, it is licensed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the City. 





D. 	Conditions. Conditions may be imposed relative to physical conditions or operations (including limitations on future expansion), that the Planning Commission determines are necessary to ensure that, as a conforming use, the use will not become a nuisance. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, changes or upgrades to infrastructure, buildings, structures, lighting, landscaping, parking, drainage, or hours of operation of the use. 
E. 	Effect of Approval. Uses that comply with the terms of a conditional use approval that is issued in accordance with this Section are converted from legally nonconforming uses to conforming uses by virtue of the issuance of the conditional use permit, and subject to its terms. Conditional use approvals shall be provided to the Applicant in writing and may be recorded by the Applicant at the Applicant’s expense. 
F. 	Effect of Denial. If an application for conversion of a nonconforming use is denied, the use shall thereafter retain its 
status as a nonconforming use. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.11.03 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures 
18.11.03.01 Modifications to a Nonconforming Building or Structure 
A building or structure (other than a sign) that is located on a subject property that is conforming as to use, but is nonconforming as to height, setback, or coverage, may be altered or extended, provided that the alteration or extension does not result in a further violation of this UDC or applicable Building Codes. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.03.02 Damage to a Nonconforming Building or Structure 
A. 	Cost of Repair is 50 Percent or More of Appraised Value. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged to the extent that the cost of repair is 50 percent or more of the appraised value of the subject property (including the building or structure) for ad valorem tax purposes, then future construction on the subject property shall conform to the requirements of this UDC. 
B. 	Cost of Repair is Less than 50 Percent of Appraised Value. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged to the extent that the cost of repair is less than 50 percent of the appraised value of the subject property (including the building or structure) for ad valorem tax purposes, then restoration is allowed, provided that it is commenced within 18 months after the damage, and completed within 36 months after commencement. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.03.03 Conversion of a Nonconforming Building or Structure to a Conforming Building or Structure 
A. 	Generally. In many instances, nonconforming buildings or structures may be integral parts of the City’s fabric, that is, its character and function, so their continuing existence promotes the City’s policy of retaining existing businesses or protecting its character and neighborhoods. In these instances, the classification nonconforming building or structure and resulting restriction on investment may not be what the community desires. As such, a nonconforming building or structure may be made conforming pursuant to this Section in order to remove the potential stigma associated with the nonconforming designation. 
B. 	Limitation. This Section does not apply to nonconformities involving the Building Code. 
C. 	Administrative Conversions. A nonconforming building may be made conforming using Section 18.17.15.01, Administrative Variations; or Section 18.17.15.05, Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities. 
D. 	Public Hearing Conversions. A nonconforming building or structure may be made conforming using Section 18.17.15.07, Variances. 
E. 	Conditions. Conditions may be imposed relative to physical conditions (including limitations on future building or structure expansion), that the decision-maker determines are necessary to ensure that, as a conforming building or structure, the building or structure will not become a nuisance. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, changes or upgrades to infrastructure, buildings, structures, lighting, landscaping, parking, or drainage. 

F. 	Effect of Approval. Buildings or structures that are approved as provided in subsection C. or D., above, are converted from legally nonconforming buildings or structures to conforming buildings or structures by virtue of the issuance of the approval, subject to its terms. Such approvals shall be provided to the Applicant in writing and may be recorded by the Applicant at the Applicant’s expense. 
G. 	Effect of Denial. If an application for conversion of a nonconforming building or structure is denied, the building or 
structure shall thereafter retain its status as a nonconforming building or structure. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.11.04 Nonconforming Signs 
18.11.04.01 Application of Division 
A. 	Generally. The standards of this Division shall apply to nonconforming signs. 
B. 	Determination of Nonconformity. Signs erected before January 1, 1987 are not presumed to be illegal merely because a sign permit is not on file with the City. Other factors, including the size, setback, height and applicable regulations on the date of erection or installation of the sign will be considered in determining whether or not a sign was illegal when erected or installed. 
C. 	Minor Sign Area or Height Nonconformities. Any existing nonconforming sign for which a sign permit has been issued pursuant to a previously adopted code, excluding prohibited signs, which exceeds only the maximum sign area for each sign or maximum height limitations of this UDC, as specified in Division 18.04.08, Signs, by 20 percent or less shall be considered a conforming sign and shall not need to be removed or altered. However, should the sign or sign structure, excluding the sign face, be replaced, the replacement sign or sign structure shall comply with all applicable requirements of this UDC. 
D. 	Variance and Special Review Approvals. All permanent signs that were approved by the City through the variance or special review process, but do not meet the current requirements of this UDC, shall be considered conforming signs for so long as they comply with the provisions of the variance or special review approval, and for so long as the variance or special review approval remains in effect. If a variance or special review approval is abandoned, all signs that were approved by the variance or special review shall be brought into conformance with this UDC. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.11.04.02 Historic Signs 
A. 	Historic Sign Permit. Within ten days after application by the owner of the subject property, the Director shall issue an historic sign permit for any sign that the Director determines meets the following criteria: 
1. 	
The sign provides evidence of the historic use of the subject property. 

2. 	
The sign is representative of signs from the era in which it was constructed;

18.14.02.03 Improvements Agreements 
A. 	Generally. Development approvals may include requirements for the provision of public improvements, drainage improvements, or landscaping to serve the proposed development or land on which development is to occur, or to mitigate the impacts of the development, pursuant to the requirements of this Code. Such requirements are memorialized in an Improvements Agreement. An Improvements Agreement may be combined with a Development Agreement (see Section 18.14.02.04, Development Agreements) in a single document. 
B. 	Public Improvements Determination. The Director shall determine whether the dedication, acquisition, relocation, modification, improvement, installation or construction of public improvements, drainage improvements, or landscaping shall be required for a proposed development or property based on applicable standards. 
C. 	Improvements Agreement Required. If the provision of public improvements, drainage improvements, or landscaping is required, the applicant (and landowner, if different) shall be required to enter into an improvements agreement in a form approved by the City Attorney and executed by the City Manager. 
D. 	Essential Terms. Improvements agreements shall include the following essential terms: 
1. 	
Identification of Improvements. The improvements agreement shall identify the public improvements, drainage improvements, and landscape improvements that are required. 

2. 	
Assurances. The improvements agreement shall provide adequate assurances that: 

a. 	
The improvements will be installed and constructed to the City’s established standards in a timely manner; and 

b. 	
The improvements will be maintained, repaired, or replaced, as appropriate, during their applicable warranty periods. 



3. 	
Security. The improvements agreement may require the applicant to submit a cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit, or bond to provide appropriate security for the assurances in the agreement. The City may require that the security be provided to the City prior to and as a condition of the issuance of permits for construction of the proposed development. 

4. 	
Subordination of Liens. Except as otherwise agreed by the City, all mortgagees shall be required to subordinate their liens and interest in the property to the covenants and the restrictions of the improvements agreement. 



E. 	Phasing. The improvements agreement may, if approved by the Director, authorize the installation, construction, or reconstruction of public improvements, drainage improvements, or landscaping to be carried out in phases. Any phase of development approved through an improvements agreement must be an integrated, self-contained project consisting of all improvements, landscaping, and irrigation necessary to serve the portion of property to be developed as part of such phase. The City may impose reasonable conditions on phasing in order to preserve the integrity of the development, or to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community or adjacent properties. 
F. 	Public Improvement Construction Plans. Prior to issuance of any development approval or permit for which an improvements agreement is a prerequisite, public improvement construction plans must be submitted to the City for review and approval. The City-approved public improvement construction plans shall be used as the basis for the cost estimates that are used to calculate the amount of security that is required by the improvements agreement. 
G. 	Early Building Permits. The improvements agreement may authorize the issuance of building permits prior to installation, construction, or reconstruction of certain public improvements, drainage improvements, or landscaping (collectively, the “Improvements”) provided the applicant demonstrates and the Director finds that: 
1. 	
Unanticipated difficulties beyond the applicant’s control make it commercially impracticable to install the required improvements prior to the issuance of building permits, but it is reasonably probable that the Improvements will be installed within six months after the issuance of the building permits; 

2. 	
Issuance of such building permits will not create a threat to public health, safety, or welfare; 

3. 	
Prior to the issuance of any such building permits: 

a. 	
The Public Works Department has approved the Subdivision Lot Grading Certificate form; 

b. 	
Adequate all-weather access to the construction site is provided for fire and emergency vehicles and approved by the Loveland Fire and Rescue Authority; 

c. 	
All underground electric lines and related equipment are installed, unless such installation is waived by the Loveland Water and Power Department; 

d. 	
Temporary erosion control measures are installed on the site in compliance with City standards and approved by the Public Works Department; 

e. 	
Prior to the delivery of any combustible building materials to the construction site, adequate water supply for fire protection is provided to the construction site; 

f. 	
The Director has verified that any other conditions the Director has determined to be necessary to avoid a threat to public health, safety, or welfare have been met; and 

g. 	
Financial security in a form satisfactory to the City, in the amount of 110 percent of the cost of installation of the Improvements that remain to be constructed at the time the building permits are issued has been provided to the City. 




H. 	Temporary Certificates of Occupancy. The Director may issue temporary certificates of occupancy prior to installation of all required improvements if the Director determines that issuance of such certificates of occupancy will not cause a threat to public health, safety or welfare. 
I. 	Clear Certificates of Occupancy. No inspections shall be made by the City for purposes of issuing a clear certificate of occupancy until all final improvements and other requirements imposed by the provisions of this Code or by the City at the time an annexation map or subdivision plat is approved have been installed or performed by the applicant in compliance with plans and specifications approved by the City engineer and as required by this Code or any other applicable ordinances or resolutions passed by the City. 

18.14.02.04 Development Agreements 
A. 	Generally. A development agreement is a legal document between the City, the developer, and owners of property to ensure all development requirements and conditions will be met. A development agreement describes and defines conditions specific to the development of a property. A Development Agreement may be combined with an Improvements Agreement (see Section 18.14.02.03, Improvements Agreements) in a single document. 
B. 	Development Agreement Required. All conditions of approval applicable to a plat shall be included in a development agreement. A development agreement may also be required for other development applications that specify conditions of approval to be satisfied at a future date. 
C. 	Approval. Development agreements shall be processed in accordance with Section 18.14.02.02, Decision-Making Tracks by Application Type. 
D. 	Amendment. Amendments to a development agreement may be approved by the Director unless otherwise specified in the development agreement. 
E. 	Recording. Development agreements shall be recorded with the Larimer County Clerk and Recorder. When a development agreement is associated with a plat, the agreement shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of the plat. All other development agreements shall be recorded prior to approval of the associated development application.

The Director may establish and post a regular schedule for concept review meetings and for intake of required materials. The Director may make provisions for telephonic or video conferences. 
B. 	Waiver. The Director may waive the concept review meeting for good cause shown. 
C. 	Purpose. The purpose of the concept review meeting is threefold:

To coordinate with representatives from agencies and departments with an administrative interest in the development in order to discuss issues concerning the development early in the review process; 

3. 	
To review the applicant’s concept plan and to identify application requirements. 


D. 	Required Materials.

18.14.03.03 Ex Parte Communications 
A. 	Generally. Ex parte communications are communications between applicants or others (including, but not limited to, City residents) and the zoning board of adjustment or its designated hearing officer, Planning Commissioners or City Council members about the merits of a pending application for development approval or appeal outside of a noticed public hearing at which the development approval or appeal will be heard. It is the policy and practice of the City to decide applications and appeals only on the merits presented in the application or petition for appeal, in on-record public comments, and at public hearings (if public hearings are required). Ex parte communications are not allowed. 
B. 	Timing. 
1. 	
Zoning Board of Adjustment. The prohibition on ex parte communications begins on the date that an appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment or its designated hearing officer is filed pursuant to the requirements of this code and ends when the appeal period for a variance has expired. 

2. 	
Planning Commission. The prohibition on ex parte communications begins on the date that an appeal to the Planning Commission is filed pursuant to the requirements of this code and ends when the appeal period for a development approval has expired. 

3. 	
City Council. The prohibition on ex parte communications begins on the date that an appeal to City Council is filed pursuant to the requirements of this code and ends when the appeal period for a development approval has expired. 



C. 	Inadvertent Communications. It is not always possible to prevent ex parte communications. The zoning board of adjustment or its designated hearing officer, Planning Commissioners and City Council members shall not privately discuss the merits of a pending application or appeal. If a communication is received outside of the record (e.g., it is not in the application, agency comments, or public comments, nor was it presented at a noticed public hearing) then the member shall disclose the communication, including the speaker and the substance of the communication, on the record of the public hearing before the application is heard. The decision-maker or recommending body must base its decision only on the evidence presented on the record. The contents of the ex parte communication shall not be considered part of the record for decision-making unless the information in the communication is also presented at the hearing (other than through the required disclosure).

D. 	Schedule. The Director is authorized, but not required, to establish regular intake days for any or all classifications of 
applications for development approval, except sign permits and appeals. Effective on: 11/20/2018

The applicant shall respond to the comments by either revising the application materials or by providing a response that describes why revisions are not necessary. 

2. 	
The Director may refer a revised application or response to comments to referral agencies again if changes substantially affect the interests of the agency in ways not anticipated by the agency’s original comments (or lack thereof), if the response requires the agency’s technical expertise for adequate review, or if requested by the referral agencies. 

3.

18.14.03.15 Vested Rights 
A. 	Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide procedures necessary to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended. 
B. 	Vested Property Right Created. 
1. 	
A vested property right shall be deemed to have been created only upon the approval of a site specific development plan in accordance with this Section. 

2. 	
Any approval of a site specific development plan, or amendment to an existing site specific development plan, that creates vested property rights shall be adopted by ordinance as a legislative act and shall be subject to referendum. When creating a vested property right, City Council may expressly exempt, in whole or in part, administrative amendments to a site specific development plan from additional review and approval by City Council under this Section. 

3. 	
The establishment of a vested property right shall not preclude the application of ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and which are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the City, including but not limited to the regulations concerning uniform building codes, uniform design standards, regulations concerning subdivision improvements and right-of-way dedications, and regulations establishing requirements and specifications for any public improvements. 

4. 	
The establishment of a vested property right shall not preclude the application of any legislatively adopted fees which are general in nature, uniform in character and applicable to all properties or a similarly situated class of properties. 

5. 	
The City may approve a site specific development plan subject to such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the City and its residents. 

6. 	
Any site specific development plan for a multiple-phase development may have separate vesting periods created for each phase. The vesting for any subsequent phase may be contingent upon completion of the preceding phase and review by the City Council. Such review shall include but not be limited to whether the landowner or developer is in compliance with its obligations to the City, including but not limited to the site specific development plan, the improvements agreement and any other agreements between the landowner and the City, as they may have been amended from time to time. 



C. 	Notice and Hearing. Consideration of a site specific development plan for creation of vested property rights must be preceded by the applicable notice and public hearing in compliance with Section 18.14.03.09, Public Hearing Notice and Schedule, and Section 18.14.03.12, Hearing Procedures. 
D. 	Notice of Approval. 
1. 	
Each document constituting a site specific development plan shall contain the following language: “Approval of this plan or agreement constitutes a vested property right pursuant to Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended, and Section 18.14.03.15 of the Loveland Unified Development Code as amended.” The failure of the document constituting a site specific development plan to contain the language specified this subsection shall invalidate and void the creation of the vested property right. 

2. 	
A notice stating that a vested property right has been created shall be published once by the City in a newspaper of general circulation in the City not more than 14 days after final adoption of the ordinance approving the site specific development plan.

a. 	
A statement advising the public of the site specific development plan approval, including the name of the project and general location of the specific property or development parcels affected; 

b. 	
A statement that a vested property right has been created in accordance with Article 68 of Title 24, Colorado Revised Statutes, and Section 18.14.03.15 of the Loveland Unified Development Code. 




E. 	Duration of Vested Right. 
1. 	
Generally. A property right vested pursuant to this Section shall remain vested for a period of three years. 

2. 	
Extended Vesting Periods. The City Council, in its legislative discretion, may approve an initial vesting period that is longer than three years, in consideration of the following factors: 

a. 	
The size and phasing of the development, and specifically but not limited to, whether the development can be reasonably completed within three years; 

b. 	
Economic cycles (including, local, regional, and state economic cycles, and national economic cycles); 

c. 	
Market conditions, and specifically but not limited to, absorption rates for leasing and sales of similar development projects; 

d. 	
Consistency with the City of Loveland Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans; 

e. 	
Proposed public amenities and benefits that enhance the project and the overall attractiveness of the community, including the degree to which such public amenities and benefits are defined in terms of design, timeframe, and phasing with development; 

f. 	
Projected public financial benefits or costs anticipated to result from the development, including the timeframe for realization by the City or other public entities and potential costs for operation and maintenance of any new public amenities or infrastructure dedicated to the City or other public entities; 

g. 	
The breadth and scope of the requested vested property right, including but not limited to, the extent to which such vested property right restricts the City’s ability to apply future regulations for the purpose of providing public infrastructure, public services, or public facilities and for the purpose of meeting evolving community needs; 

h. 	
Any proposed modifications to previously approved vested property rights to address changed conditions within the City, consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and other community plans, or performance of previously approved site specific development plans; and 

i. 	
Any other factors deemed relevant to the City Council. 





F. 	Extension of Vested Property Rights. A landowner may request an extension of vested property rights by submitting an application for extension of vested property rights at least 120 days prior to the expiration of the period of vested property rights. The extension request shall be processed in accordance with the procedural requirements of this Chapter, including but not limited to notice, public hearing, adoption by ordinance, and post-approval publication. The criteria in subsection E., above, shall be considered by City Council when determining whether to grant an extension to a vested property right.

1.

2.

H. 	Forfeiture of Vested Property Rights. 
1. 	
Failure to abide by the terms and conditions of a site specific development plan may result in a forfeiture of the vested property rights in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. 

2. 	
The process to consider forfeiture of vested property rights shall be initiated by passage of a resolution by the City Council stating the grounds therefor. 

3. 	
No vested property right shall be deemed forfeited until after notice and a public hearing. Notice shall be provided at least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing, by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Loveland and by mailing notice to the property owner(s), sent to the address of record according the County Assessor’s records via first class United States mail. A copy of the resolution initiating the process to consider forfeiture of the vested property right shall be included with the mailed notice to the property owner(s). 

4. 	
At the hearing, the City Council shall consider all evidence and testimony presented concerning any failure to abide by the terms and conditions of a site specific development plan. The City Council may continue the public hearing to allow additional evidence to be presented. 

5. 	
If City Council finds a failure to abide by the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan, the City Council may take action by ordinance to declare the vested property rights forfeited. The forfeiture of a vested property right shall have no effect upon public streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or other lands or easements previously dedicated or conveyed to the City or other public entities pursuant to the terms of a site specific development plan. Upon forfeiture of vested property rights, the site specific development plan shall be subject to all zoning, land use, and general regulations in effect at the time of forfeiture and as such may be amended from time to time thereafter.

For example, if a lot includes a single structure of 20,000 square feet and the existing use being changed only pertains to a 5,000 square foot portion of the structure that is physically separated and permitted for a single use, the credit shall be determined based only on that 5,000 square feet. 
C. 	Application of Credit on Single Lot. 
1. 	
The credit shall be applied to capital expansion fees due for new uses established on the lot. 

2. 	
If capital expansion fees for a new use on a lot are greater than the amount of the credit, the difference shall be due at the time set forth in Section 18.16.04.02 Capital Expansion Fees Imposed. 

3. 	
If capital expansion fees for a new use on a lot are less than the amount of the credit, no additional capital expansion fees shall be due for the new use on the lot. 

4. 	
Any excess capital expansion fee credit after application to a new use established on the lot from which it arose may be applied thereafter to each additional new use or change in use on the lot on a first-come, first-served basis, based on the date upon which a complete application for such development has been accepted by the City, except to the extent the credit has been previously used on other lots as provided in Subsection D. or E. below. Once an excess credit is established, the amount of that credit shall not be adjusted based on an increase in capital expansion fees, inflation or on any other basis. 


D. 	Application of Credit to Site with Multiple Lots. Any remaining excess credit after application to a new use established on the lot from which it arose may be applied to each additional new use or change in use on adjacent lots within a site on a first-come, first-served basis, based on the date upon which a complete application for development for each new use has been accepted by the City. 
E. 	Application of Credit Offsite. Any credit not used on a single lot or within a site may be used for capital expansion fees due for any new use established outside the lot or site only with buildings moved from the lot or site on a first-come, first-served basis, based on the date upon which a complete application for development has been accepted by the City. 
F. 	Nature of Credit. Any capital expansion fee credit established under this section shall not constitute a property right of any kind and shall not be owned by the property owner or transferable or assignable by the property owner to any third party. Except as provided in paragraphs D. and E. above, credit shall remain with the lot from which it arises.

Effective on: 11/20/2018 
Division 18.17.08 Planned Unit Development 
18.17.08.01 Intent of Planned Unit Development 
A. 	Generally. The planned unit development (“PUD”) process is intended to provide for the creation of a zoning district that allows for a mix of land uses and development standards that would not otherwise be permitted within the other zoning districts that are established by this UDC. Once approved by City Council, the PUD establishes the land use and development standards for the subject property as a separate and unique zoning district. 
B. 	Intent. 
1. 	
The intent of the PUD is to permit greater flexibility of use and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design for development than generally is possible under conventional zoning regulations. The PUD process is intended to be utilized primarily for large-scale projects with multiple lots, a mix of land uses, and an extended build-out period. However, smaller-scale (even single lot) projects that require flexibility because of unique circumstances or unique design may also be suitable for a PUD. 

2. 	
The PUD process is further intended to: 

a. 	
Promote more economical and efficient use of land; 

b. 	
Provide flexible zoning entitlements for projects that may be subdivided and developed in multiple phases over an extended period; and 





c. Provide flexible land use standards to encourage innovative development. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.08.02 Continued Development of Existing Planned Unit Developments 
A. 	Generally. Property that is subject to an approved general development plan, preliminary development plan, or final development plan that was approved prior to the effective date of this UDC may be developed in accordance with the approved plan as provided in this Section. 
B. 	General Development Plan. An approved general development plan (“GDP”) shall be considered a Zoning Document. In the event that a GDP fails to address a standard of this UDC, the standard of this UDC shall be applied. Subsequent development may be carried out using a sketch plat or sketch site development plan that are consistent with the general development plan, followed by a final plat or site development plan that is consistent with the sketch plat or sketch site development plan, as applicable. 
C. 	Preliminary Development Plan. An approved preliminary development plan (“PDP”) shall be considered the following: 
1. 	
A non-phased PDP in which there was not an approved GDP, shall be considered a Zoning Document, a sketch site development plan, and a sketch plat, as applicable. In the event that a PDP fails to address a standard of this UDC, the standard of this UDC shall be applied. Subsequent development may be carried out using a site development plan and final plat, as applicable. 

2. 	
A phased PDP subject to an approved GDP, shall be considered a sketch site development plan or a sketch plat, as applicable. Subsequent development may be carried out using a final plat or site development plan, as applicable. 


D. 	Final Development Plan. An approved final development plan (“FDP”) shall be carried out using a final plat, site development plan, or building permit, as applicable to the type of land use as set forth in Division 18.02.03, Land Use by Zone. In the event that a FDP fails to address a standard of this UDC, the standard of this UDC shall be applied. Amendments to final development plans shall be processed as new final plats or site development plans, as applicable. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.08.03 Expiration of Existing Planned Unit Developments 
A. 	Generally. Unless the approval is vested in accordance with Section 18.14.03.15, Vested Rights, the approval of an existing general development plan and preliminary development plan shall lapse if an application for a sketch plat, sketch site development plan, site development plan, or final plat is not filed with the City within one year after the date of approval of the general development plan or preliminary development plan. 
B. 	
Effect of Expiration. Upon expiration of a general development plan or preliminary development plan, the plan shall continue to be effective if no provisions of this UDC that affect the plan have been amended in such a manner as to make the plan nonconforming to this UDC. If the plan has become nonconforming to this UDC, the applicant may either: 

1. 	Submit a PUD Concept Plan according to Section 18.17.08.06, PUD Concept Plans; or 

2. 
Submit an application to rezone the subject property. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.17.08.04 Engineering Drawings and Reports for Existing PUDs 
Engineering drawings and reports that are submitted with approved planned unit development plans shall continue to be valid to the extent they are relevant to subsequent approval steps under this UDC that are timely pursued. Effective on: 11/20/2018 

18.17.08.05 Applicability of UDC Standards to Planned Unit Developments 
Land use and development standards that are part of an approved PUD supersede the standards that are set out in this UDC. However, where a PUD approval is silent in regards to a land use or development standard, the standards that are set out in this UDC shall apply. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.08.06 PUD Concept Plans 
A. 	Generally. A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use and site plan for an area that is proposed to be included within a PUD zone. It is the first step in the PUD process, intended to allow for early, informal evaluation of a proposed PUD zone at a conceptual stage. The PUD Concept Plan allows for the initial evaluation of the potential development’s conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and the requirements of this UDC, and helps to guide the preparation of a PUD Zoning Document (see Section 18.17.08.07, Zoning Documents). 
B. 	Waiver of Requirement. The Director may waive the requirement to file a PUD Concept Plan. 
C. 	Review. The Director will review the PUD Concept Plan and provide an authorization letter to proceed, with or without comments. All comments shall be designed to assist the applicant in the development of the PUD Zoning Document application. In addition, if requested by the Director, the Planning Commission may review the PUD Concept Plan and provide further comment. 
D. 	Comment Not Binding. Any comments provided to the applicant are informational only and shall not represent a commitment on behalf of the City regarding the approval of a subsequent PUD Zoning Document. 
E. 	
Contents. The PUD Concept Plan shall include such information as required in the application checklist approved by the Director, which shall at a minimum, include the following: 

1. 	
Perimeter property lines with measurements; 

2. 	
Existing and platted streets within or adjacent to the proposed PUD zone, with right-of-way dimensions, street classifications, and street names; 

3. 	
Proposed collector and arterial streets within or adjacent to the proposed PUD zone, with right-of-way dimensions, street classifications, and street names; 

4. 	
Land use and zoning district designations for adjacent properties; 

5. 	
Narrative describing the intent of the PUD and an indication of deviations to standards in the UDC that will be requested with the Zoning Document; 

6. 	
Development areas or parcels within the subject property, labeled with the proposed land uses, total acres and square feet, development density and intensity by dwelling units per acre and / or floor area ratio of non­residential uses; 

7. 	
Location and type of existing and proposed vehicular access points; 

8. 	
Location of environmentally sensitive areas, drainage courses, parks, trails, amenity areas, storm water facilities, easements, underground utilities, and existing buildings to remain; 

9. 	
Locations of proposed storm detention and / or retention facilities; and 



10. 
Topography of site. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.17.08.07 Zoning Documents 
A. 	Generally. A Zoning Document establishes standards for the development of property zoned for PUD, including allowable land uses and bulk standards. A Zoning Document covers all of the land area to be included in the PUD and identifies: 
1. 	The type and total amount of development to occur within the PUD (land use, number of dwelling units, and nonresidential floor area); 

Page 330 
2. 	
The proposed plan for pedestrian and vehicular circulation within and leading to the PUD; and 

3. 	
Required buffering or transitions along the boundaries of the PUD zone. 


B. 	Modification of Zoning Standards. Development within a PUD shall comply with the design and use standards in the UDC, unless deviations to the standards are set out in the Zoning Document. In the event that the Zoning Document fails to address a standard of this UDC that is not district-specific, the standard of this UDC shall be applied. 
C. 	Consistency with PUD Concept Plan. The Zoning Document shall be consistent with a previously reviewed PUD Concept Plan, or an amendment to the Concept Plan shall be submitted. This requirement does not apply if the PUD Concept Plan requirement was waived by the Director; or 
D. 	Design Guidelines. The Zoning Document may include design guidelines for development within the PUD, in order to provide for a particular building character or theme. 
E. 	Subsequent Development. After approval of a Zoning Document, subsequent development may be carried out using a sketch plat, sketch site development plan, site development plan, or final plat that are consistent with the Zoning Document. Areas identified as public or common amenity areas in the PUD shall be processed as a sketch site development plan or site development plan concurrently with the sketch plat or final subdivision plat that creates the boundaries for the public or common amenity area. 
F. 	Simultaneous Processing. An applicant may, at the applicant’s sole risk, submit a sketch plat, sketch site development plan, final plat, or site development plan for simultaneous processing with a Zoning Document. 
G. 	Standards. A Zoning Document may be approved if it is demonstrated that it complies with all of the following standards: 
1. 	
The Zoning Document is consistent with the policies and goals of the Comprehensive Plan, any applicable adopted area plan, or community plan of the City, or reflects stated conditions that have changed since the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan; 

2. 	
The Zoning Document either: 

a. 	
Advances the following policy objectives: 

1. 	
Promoting more economical and efficient use of land while providing a harmonious grouping of a variety of land uses; 

2. 	
Allowing for a project that assists in the implementation of adopted City plans (and not as a device to circumvent the standards of this UDC and good planning practice); 

3. 	
Addressing a unique situation or conferring a substantial benefit to the City; or 



b. 	
The creation of a PUD zone is the only practical way to avoid completely prohibiting a legal, permitted business use within the City. 



3. 	
The PUD complies with all applicable City standards not specifically modified or waived by the Zoning Document; 

4. 	
The PUD is integrated and connected with adjacent development through street connections, sidewalks, trails, multi-use pathways, and similar features; 

5. 	
To the maximum extent feasible, the proposal mitigates any potential significant adverse impacts on adjacent properties or on the general community; 

6. 	
Sufficient public safety, transportation, and utility facilities and services are available to serve the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development; and 

7. 	
The same development could not be accomplished through the use of other techniques, such as complete neighborhood development, application of the Enhanced Corridor Overlay Zone, height exceptions, variances, minor modifications, or a planned unit development is a preferable way to regulate the subject property due to its large land area or multi-year build-out schedule; and 

8. 	
As applicable, the proposed phasing plan for development of the PUD is rational in terms of available infrastructure, and capacity. 


H. 	Approval by Ordinance. Because approval of a Zoning Document creates a new zone in the City that requires an amendment to the Zoning Map, the approval shall be in the form of an ordinance. 

I. 	
Contents. In addition to the items required in Section 18.17.08.06, PUD Concept Plans, a Zoning Document shall include such information as required in the application checklist approved by the Director, which shall at a minimum, include the following: 

1. 	
Narrative describing how the PUD complies with the standards in subsection G., above. 

2. 	
Master drainage study, as determined by the City Engineer; 

3. 	
Master traffic impact study, as determined by the City Engineer; 

4. 	
Environmentally sensitive areas report; 

5. 	
Generalized layout of the areas within the proposed development including conceptual access points and streets, stormwater facilities, and location of natural features. 

6. 	
Building bulk standards and land use table; 

7. 	
Description of public and private improvements, including a conceptual landscape and open space plan; 

8. 	
Typical street cross-sections; 

9. 	
Conceptual utility plan showing the existing and proposed public and private utilities; 

10. 
Alternative or deviations to standards requested with the PUD; and 



11. 
Buffering or transitions along the perimeter of the PUD zone. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.17.08.08 Minor Amendments to Zoning Documents 
A. 	Generally. An application for a minor amendment to a Zoning Document may be filed for all or a portion of the land area within an approved PUD zone. 
B. 	Thresholds. Minor amendments to the Zoning Document that the Director determines to be a de minimus change to the approved PUD zoning document, do not require the applicant to follow the City rezoning procedure, and may be approved administratively by the Director. Minor amendments include: 
1. 	A less than 20 percent increase or decrease in any numerical provision of the Zoning Document, which may include: 
a. 	
Building coverage; 

b. 	
Lot frontage, lot depth, or lot area; 

c. 	
Building setback or building height; 

d. 	
Size of zoning areas within the boundaries of the PUD; 

e. 	
Density or intensity in an individual area of the PUD, provided that such increase or decrease does not: 

1. 	
Exceed the maximum density or number of units permitted in the PUD; 

2. 	
Exceed the maximum floor area permitted in the PUD; 

3. 	
Alter the designation of the property with respect to the Comprehensive Plan; or 

4. 	
Modify a condition of approval of the PUD zoning document. 



f. 	
Size of designated open spaces or recreation areas; 

g. 	
Number of parking, loading, or unloading spaces; 

h. 	
Amount of landscaping; or 

i. 	
Width of a proposed street section, right-of-way, or easement held by the City, provided that such increase or decrease is in compliance with the City of Loveland Street Standards. 


2. 	
A change in the street pattern that will not adversely impact adjacent property; 

3. 	
Any proposed change in an approved phasing plan, provided that: 

a. 	
Each phase in the resulting plan could be approved under this UDC without the other phases; and 

b. 	
The projected build-out date does not change. 



4. 	
Changes in items such as location of landscaping, fencing, fire access lanes, parking, loading, trash and service areas, signage, and sidewalk location which the Director determines to be insignificant in nature; 

5. 	
Changes in the location, number, or classification of curb cuts or street intersections, provided that such change is in compliance with the City of Loveland Street Standards; and 



C. 	Application Requirements. The application for a minor amendment to a PUD zoning document shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
1. 	
An application form signed by the property owner or authorized representative; 

2. 	
A written narrative explaining and justifying the request; 

3. 	
Revised Zoning Document sheets, with the revisions clearly documented, including signature blocks for recording as determined by the Director. 


D. 	Documentation. The Director shall note any terms of the approved amendment directly on the minor zoning document amendment sheet(s) and affix his or her signature and the date of approval. As applicable, such amended plans shall be recorded. 
E. 	Approval. The Director may approve the application for a minor amendment or forward the application to the 
Planning Commission for review and approval. Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.08.09 Major Amendments to Zoning Documents 
A major amendment to the PUD Zoning Document (i.e., an amendment that is not authorized by Section 18.17.08.08, 
Minor Amendments to Zoning Documents) shall be processed as a rezoning. 
Effective on: 11/20/2018 

Division 18.17.09 Zoning and Rezoning 
18.17.09.01 Standards for Rezoning 
A. 	Generally. The City Council may approve an application for rezoning if it finds that: 
1. 	
The criteria of subsections B. and C., below, are met; and 

2. 	
One or more of the alternatives set out in subsection D., below, are met; 

3. 	
The subject property is a legal lot of record (or group of contiguous legal lots of record); and 

4. 	
No legal lot of record will contain multiple zones within its boundaries as a result of the rezoning. 


B. 	Resource Protection Policy. 
1. 	It is the policy of the City not to rezone property in a manner that would create or facilitate the creation of development rights or entitlements that would either: 
a. 	
Reduce the level of protection for significant natural resources that exist on the subject property; or 

b. 	
Expose additional people or personal property to unmitigated natural hazards that are present on the subject property (e.g., fire, flood, or geological hazards). 


2. 	This policy may be waived upon a finding by the City Council that: 
a. 	
Alternative means have been implemented to achieve a comparable or better level of resource protection (e.g., conservation easements, development agreements, or other comparable mechanisms for resource protection); or 

b. 	
The policy is outweighed by a substantial community interest that is served by approval of the rezoning (see Subsection C.1., below). 


C. 	Plan Consistency and Public Benefits. All applications for rezoning shall meet the following criteria: 

1. 	
The proposed zone, as applied to the subject property, is consistent with its land use designation in the Comprehensive Plan or an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan is approved in accordance with Section 4 of the Comprehensive Plan prior to the approval of the rezoning application; 

2. 	
Rezoning to the proposed zone will provide a benefit to the community or immediate area that cannot be provided under the existing zone, and the balance between the anticipated benefit, if any, and the anticipated burden on the community or immediate area, if any, is either neutral or favors the rezoning; 

3. 	
The proposed zone would not cause an I zone to share a boundary with an ER, R1e, R1, R2, R3e, or R3 zone, unless there is sufficient land area on the subject property to provide a buffer, as set out in Division 18.08.03, Standards for Bufferyards, and a development agreement is approved to mitigate use incompatibilities with fencing, walls, landscaping, noise and lighting restrictions, or other appropriate techniques; and 

4. 	
Adequate community facilities are available to serve development in the proposed zone in accordance with Section 18.15.02.05, Determination Regarding Adequacy; or the proposed zone would limit demands upon community facilities more than the existing zone; or reasonable assurances are provided that adequate community facilities will be made available to serve new development by the time the new development places demands on the facilities. 


D. 	Additional Findings. The City Council may approve an application for rezoning upon a determination that at least one of the following three criteria has been met. This finding is in addition to the findings regarding the criteria of subsections B. and C., above: 
1. 	
Alternative #1: Plan Implementation. The proposed zone is more appropriate than the existing zone to implement an adopted or approved current City plan that was developed with public input (e.g., the Comprehensive Plan, the Highway 287 Strategic Plan, etc.). 

2. 	
Alternative #2: Change in Character of the Area. The City Council finds that the proposed zone is more appropriate than the existing zone because: 

a. 	
There has been a change in character or capacity of public infrastructure in the area (e.g., installation of public facilities, other zone changes, new growth trends, deterioration, development transitions, etc.); and 

b.

18.17.15.06 Height Exception 
A. 	Generally. Height exceptions are authorizations to exceed the building or structure height standards of this UDC that are not otherwise allowed pursuant to Section 18.17.15.01, Administrative Variations. The Planning Commission may grant a height exception pursuant to the standards of this Section. 
B. 	
Standards. The Planning Commission may grant a height exception only if it is demonstrated that: 

1. 	
The requested exception allows adequate light and air to the notice area; 

2. 	
The requested exception is not an obvious disruption to the established pattern of mass and scale in the notice area; 

3. 	
The requested exception will not be injurious to other property owners within the notice area, or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare; and 



4. 
The requested exception is consistent with the intent of the zone in which the subject property is located. Effective on: 11/20/2018 


18.17.15.07 Variances 
A. 	Generally. Variances are authorizations to depart from the strict application of the standards of this UDC. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance pursuant to the standards of this Section. 
B. 	Standards. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance only when it is demonstrated that: 
1. 	
Granting the variance will not substantially conflict with any adopted plans or policies of the City, or the purposes or intent set out in this Code; 

2. 	
There are exceptional conditions creating an undue hardship, applicable only to the property involved, or the intended use thereof, which do not generally apply to the other land areas or uses within the same zone; 

3. 	
The Applicant cannot derive a reasonable use of the property without approval of a variance; 

4. 	
Granting the variance will not generally set a precedent for other applications (which would indicate that a text amendment to this UDC should be proposed and considered instead); 

5. 	
Granting the variance will not be detrimental to any adjacent properties or the area; 

6. 	
Granting the variance will not be detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare; and 

7. 	
Adequate relief cannot be reasonably obtained through a different procedure, such as the application of alternative compliance standards, if applicable. 


C. 	Alternative Standards for Existing Legal Nonconformities. In the event the basis or reason for the variance is used to remedy an existing legal nonconformity (e.g., an undersized parcel was created, or a structure whose deficient setbacks were established, or a structure had setbacks which were conforming to requirements prior to the adoption of the current Code requirements), the Zoning Board of Adjustment may approve a variance based on the following standards, but only if such relief is still reasonably necessary after the application of Chapter 18.11 Nonconformities: 
1. 	
The variance is necessary to preserve an historic building; or 

2. 	
The variance will not impose unfair burdens on adjacent property with respect to building or fire code compliance, will promote reinvestment in the existing building, and will not frustrate the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan or any adopted special area or corridor plan. 



Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.15.08 Oil and Gas Variances 
A. 	Generally. An applicant for an oil and gas permit may request a variance from any provision of Chapter 18.10, Oil, Gas, and Mineral Development. A request for a variance may be included in the applicant’s oil and gas permit application and shall be processed, reviewed and granted, granted with conditions or denied in accordance with and as part of the permit review process. The variance provisions of Section 18.17.15.07, Variances, shall not be applicable to oil and gas permits. 
B. 	Standards for Oil and Gas Variances. A variance from the application of any provision in Chapter 18.10, Oil, Gas, and Mineral Development, to an oil and gas permit shall be granted on the basis of one or more of the following grounds: 
1. 	
The provision is in operational conflict with the OGC Act or the COGCC Regulations, meaning the application of the provision would have the effect of materially impeding or destroying a state interest as expressed in the OGC Act or the COGCC regulations. 

2. 	
There is no technology commercially available at a reasonable cost to conduct the proposed oil and gas operations in compliance with the provision, and granting a variance from the operation of the provision will not have an adverse effect on the public health, safety or welfare or on the environment. 

3. 	
Protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and of the environment, would be enhanced by an alternative approach not contemplated by the provision. 

4. 	
The City finds that application of the provision would likely constitute a regulatory taking of property without just compensation by the City under Article II, Section 3 of the Colorado Constitution. 

5. 	
Application of the provision is impractical or would create an undue or unnecessary hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions existing on or near the site of the oil and gas operations, which may include, without limitation, topographical conditions, shape or dimension of the operation site, inadequate public infrastructure to the site, or the proximity of occupied buildings. 


Effective on: 11/20/2018 
18.17.15.09 Oil and Gas Overlay Zone Variances 
A. 	Generally. An owner of any real property subject to the requirements and limitations of Division 18.10.04, Oil and Gas Overlay Zone, may request a variance from those requirements and limitations. The grounds for such variance shall be those set out in Section 18.17.15.07, Variances, to the extent applicable. However, any variance to the oil and gas overlay zone standards must be in compliance with the underlying zoning or approved development plan governing the subject property. 
B. 	Alternative Standards for Variance. 
1. 	In the alternative to a variance under Section 18.17.15.07, Variances, an owner may also request a variance from the City Council as to any of the requirements and limitations of Division 18.10.04, Oil and Gas Overlay Zone, on the basis of: 
a. 	
The existence of a vested right under Section 18.14.03.15, Vested Rights, or Colorado law; or 

b. 	
A finding that application of Division 18.10.04, Oil and Gas Overlay Zone would likely constitute a regulatory taking under Article II, Section 3 of the Colorado Constitution. 


2. 	
A variance request under this subsection B. shall be made to the City Council by filing with the Director a written variance request stating all the facts and law the owner is relying on for the variance. 

3. 	
A quasi-judicial hearing before City Council to consider the variance request shall be scheduled and held not less than 30 days but not more than 60 days after filing of the owner’s written variance request. 

4. 	
Any variance approved under this subsection must be in compliance with the underlying zoning or approved 



development plan governing the subject property. Effective on: 11/20/2018

E. 	Rezoning of Vacated Parcel. Where a vacated right-of-way parcel is zoned differently than the abutting (receiving) parcel, an application for rezoning shall be processed concurrently with the application for vacation. 
F. 	Recording Requirements. The documents that effectuate a vacation shall be recorded by the City Clerk in the office of the Larimer County Clerk and Recorder at the applicant’s expense. 
G. 	Effect. Vacation of rights-of-way or access easements pursuant to this Section shall have the effect of terminating said easements or rights-of-way with respect to the City’s interests in them.

1. 	With respect to City-held easements created by a recorded final plat: 
a. 	
By approving a final plat of the property upon which the easement is located that does not show the easement; or

A. 	Generally. If at any time the Director has reasonable grounds to believe than an operator is in violation of any enforceable provision of this UDC with respect to oil and gas operations, the Director may suspend the operator’s permit. The Director shall give the operator’s designated agent written notice of the suspension and, upon receiving such notice, the operator shall immediately cease all operations under the permit, except those reasonably required to protect the public’s health and safety.

The suspension shall continue in effect until the Director determines that the violation(s) has been satisfactorily corrected. At any time during the suspension, the operator may appeal the Director’s action to the City Council by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of appeal stating with specificity the operator’s grounds for appeal. 
C. 	Appeal to City Council. 
1. 	
Within 30 days of the City Clerk’s receipt of that notice, a public hearing shall be held before the City Council. The hearing shall be conducted as a quasi-judicial proceeding with the operator having the burden of proof, and with the Director

After hearing and receiving evidence and testimony from the operator, from the Director, and from other City Staff and consultants, and after receiving public comment, the City Council may revoke the permit, terminate the suspension of the permit, or take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, taking into consideration and balancing the protection of the public’s health, safety and welfare and the operator’s rights under this UDC, the oil and gas permit, and state law to conduct its oil and gas operations. 

3. 	
Within 25 days after the hearing, the City Council shall adopt its written findings and conclusion supporting its 


decision. The Council’s written findings and conclusions shall constitute the City Council’s final decision. Effective on: 11/20/2018

In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and review fee. 
K. 	Section 109 is amended in part by the revision of Subsection 109.4 to read as follows:

15.14.050 Regulations--Flood fringe district (FF). 
A. 	Fill. The use of fill in the flood fringe district (FF) shall be the minimum necessary to comply with the provisions of this regulation. When required by the provisions of Title 18, fill in the FF district shall be to a point no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the area in question. Such fill shall further extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet beyond the extremities of any structure erected on such fill. No fill shall be used in such a manner as to restrict the flow capacity of any tributary or other drainageway to the main stream. 
B. 	Structures. 
1. 	
Any structure may be placed in the FF district only if the lowest floor level is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. Any new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the FF district by the issuance of a FEMA Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (“LOMR-F”) still must be constructed such that its lowest floor level is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. Nonresidential structures may 

be permitted without being placed on fill, provided the floodproofing requirements of Section 15.14.080 are met. 

2. 	
All utility services, furnaces, water heaters, and electrical wiring in connection with structures shall, wherever possible, be placed above the regulatory flood protection elevation or, where elevation is not practicable, shall be adequately floodproofed in a manner approved by the city building official. 

3. 	
If any structure or portions of any nonresidential structure are not constructed upon fill, the portion not on fill shall be floodproofed in a manner consistent with requirements for placing a structure in the FF district to an elevation equal to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 

4. 	
For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 

a. 	
A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 

b. 	
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the finished internal and external grade; and 

c. 	
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 



5. 	
Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. (Ord. 5717 § 3, 2012; Ord. 3441 § 11, 1987; Ord. 1708 § 1 (part), 1978) 



15.14.060 Regulations--Areas of special flood hazard. 
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required: 
A. 	New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, above the regulatory flood protection elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
1. 	
Be floodproofed so that below the regulatory flood protection elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 

2. 	
Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyance; and 

3. 	
Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the building official. 


B. 	All manufactured homes and those to be substantially improved shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system by providing over-the-top ties and frame ties to ground anchors. Specific requirements shall include (i) over-the-top ties at each of the four corners of the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations (one additional tie per side at intermediate locations for manufactured homes less than fifty feet long); and (ii) frame ties at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points (four additional ties per side at intermediate points for manufactured homes less than fifty feet long). All additions to manufactured homes shall be similarly anchored. All components of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of four thousand eight hundred pounds. 
C. 	Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1. 	
All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that 

such encroachments will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and 

2. 	
All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions. 



D. 	All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the areas of special flood hazard shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this chapter, protections shall include one of the following: (i) the structure shall be located outside of the areas of special flood hazard; or (ii) the structure’s lowest floor level shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least two feet above the regulatory flood datum. New critical facilities shall, when practical as determined by the public works department stormwater division, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a one hundred-year flood event.

3. 	
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, creation of nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing laws and regulations. 


B. 	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
C. 	Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases. 

D. 	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
E. 	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
F. 	No variances shall be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

15.56.110 Historic Residential Design Guidelines and criteria for review of alterations certificates. 
A. 	Historic Residential Design Guidelines Adopted. The “Historic Residential Design Guidelines,” dated June, 2011, are hereby adopted and are on file with the City Clerk’s Office. 
B. 	Application. The Commission shall use the Historic Residential Design Guidelines to review alteration certificates on designated landmark sites, contributing properties within a designated historic district, or any other property that requires an alteration certificate, as provided in this code and in the design guidelines. 
C. 	Amendment. The Historic Residential Design Guidelines may be amended from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
D. 	In addition to the criteria set forth in the Historic Residential Design Guidelines for alterations certificates, the Commission shall also use the following criteria to determine compatibility: 
1. 	
The effect upon the general historical and architectural character of the structure and property; 

2. 	
The architectural style, arrangement, texture, and material used on the existing and proposed structures and their relation and compatibility with other structures; 

3. 	
The size of the structure, its setbacks, its site, location, and the appropriateness thereof, when compared to existing structures and the site; 

4. 	
The compatibility of accessory structures and fences with the main structure on the site, and with other structures; 

5. 	
The effects of the proposed work in creating, changing, destroying, or otherwise impacting the exterior architectural features of the structure upon which such work is done; 

6. 	
The condition of existing improvements and whether they are a hazard to public health and safety; 

7. 	
The effects of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the property; and 

8. 	
Compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties set forth in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68. This reference shall always refer to the current standards, as amended. 



E. 	For properties which have historically been non-residential, only the criteria set forth in section 15.56.110(D) shall be applicable to determine compatibility for alterations certificates. 
F. 	The Commission shall issue an alterations certificate for any proposed work on a designated historical site or district only if the Commission can determine that the proposed work would not detrimentally alter, destroy, or adversely affect any architectural or landscape feature which contributes to its original historical designation. The Commission must find a proposed development is visually compatible with designated historic structures located on the property in terms of design, finish, material, scale, mass, and height. When the subject site is in an historic district, the Commission must also find that the proposed development is visually compatible with the development on adjacent properties. For the purposes of this section, the term “compatible” shall mean consistent with, harmonious with, and/or enhances the mixture of complementary architectural styles either of the architecture of an individual structure or the character of the surrounding structures.

Any notice of repair shall be accompanied by a detailed, step by step explanation of the particular construction defect being repaired and setting forth a reasonable completion date for the repair work. The notice shall also include the contact information for any contractors the builder intends to employ for the repairs. 
B. 	Schedule of repair work. Claimant shall promptly cooperate with the builder to schedule repair work by builder. Builder shall make a good faith effort to develop a mutually agreeable schedule with claimant for the repair work. 
C. 	Written objection to repair. Within 10 business days after receipt of the builder’s notice to repair, a claimant may deliver to the builder a written objection to the proposed repair if the claimant believes in good faith that the proposed repairs will not remedy the alleged construction defect. The builder may elect to modify the proposal, in the whole or in part, in accordance with the claimant’s objection, and proceed with the modified scope of work, or may proceed with the scope of work set forth in the original proposal, subject to the written consent of the claimant. 
D. 	Builder’s failure to comply. If the builder fails to send a notice to repair or otherwise strictly comply with this Chapter within the specified time frames, or if the builder does not complete the repairs within the time set forth in the notice to repair, the claimant shall be released from the requirements of this Chapter and may proceed with the filing of an action against the builder, unless notice and consent are required by Section 15.58.110 of this Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the builder notifies the claimant in writing at least five days before the stated completion date that the repair work will not be completed by the completion date, the builder shall be entitled to one reasonable extension of the completion date, not to exceed 60 days. 
E. 	Completion of repairs. The builder shall notify the claimant when repairs have been completed. The claimant shall have 10 business days following the completion date to have the premises inspected to verify that the repairs are complete and satisfactorily resolved the alleged construction defects. A claimant who believes in good faith that the repairs made do not resolve the construction defects may proceed with the filing of an action, unless notice and consent are required by Section 15.58.110 of this Code. 
F. 	Claimant’s failure to comply. If the builder elects to repair the construction defects, with the written consent of the claimant, it has the right to do so and the Claimant may not, directly or indirectly, impair, impede or prohibit the builder from making repairs. If the claimant, after providing written consent, directly or indirectly, impairs, impedes, 

15.58.070 Warranty of Repairs 
The repair work performed by the builder shall be warranted against material defects in design or construction for a period of two years, which warranty shall be in addition to any express warranties on the original work. 
15.58.080 Subsequently discovered defects 
Any alleged construction defect discovered after repairs have been completed shall be subject to the same requirements of this Chapter if the builder did not have notice or an opportunity to repair the particular construction defect. 
15.58.090 Settlement by payment of a sum certain 
Whether or not a builder elects to repair the alleged construction defect, a builder may offer to settle the claim by payment of a sum certain to the claimant. Whether or not a builder offers to settle a claim by payment of a sum certain, the claimant may make an offer to the builder to settle the claim by payment of a sum certain. An offer to settle by payment of a sum certain may also cover alleged construction defects that may be discovered after completion of the settlement. Neither a builder, nor a claimant is obligated to make or accept settlement by payment of a s um certain. If an offer of settlement by payment of a sum certain is made, it shall be accepted by written notice of acceptance given to the party making the offer no later than 15 days after receipt of the offer or such longer period, if any, stated in the offer as the time for acceptance. If the offer is not accepted within the 15-day period (or such longer period, if any, stated in the offer as the time for acceptance), it shall be deemed to have been rejected. If an offer to settle is accepted, the monetary settlement shall be paid in accordance with the offer and such payment shall be in full settlement and release of all claims with respect to or arising out of the alleged construction defect. Execution of such offer and acceptance shall be acknowledged before a notary public if required by the terms of the offer. Upon such settlement, either party may record in the public records maintained by the clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located a copy of the settlement offer and acceptance or a notice of the alleged construction defect and the settlement thereof, which shall provide not to persons that thereafter acquire any interest in the property that all claims with respect to or arising out of the alleged construction defect have been settled. If the builder fails to make the payment in accordance with the offer, the claimant may proceed with the filing of any action against the builder for the claim arising out of the alleged construction defect, unless notice and consent are required by Section 15.58.110 of this Code. 
15.58.100 Effect of amendment of alternative dispute resolution provisions. 
If a provision found in the declaration, bylaws or rules and regulations of a common interest community requires that construction defect claims be submitted to mediations, that requirement constitutes a commitment on the part of the unit owners and the association upon which a developer, contractor, architect, builder or other person involved in the construction of the community is entitled to rely. Consequently, a subsequent amendment to the declaration, bylaws or rules and regulations that removes or amends the mediation requirement shall not be effective with regard to any construction defect claim that is based on an alleged act or omission that predates that amendment. 
15.58.110 Informed consent of homeowners
