The objective of this section is to protect and promote public health, safety and general welfareby requiring the landscaping of parking lots which will serve to reduce noise and glare of automobile lights onto adjacent properties, return precipitation to the ground, reduce storm water problems, provide shade, stabilize property values, and facilitate a harmonious relationship between land uses on adjacent properties. 
10.03.01. 

Parking lots of one-hundred (100) or more spaces shall provide for an aggregate landscaped area or areas in the interior of the lot at a ratio of 200 square feet for every eight (8) parking spaces. The interior landscaped parking area is to be part of an integrated site development plan for the property. Planting which is required along the perimeter of the parking lot shall not be considered as part of the interior landscaping requirement.  Where a parking lot abutsbuildings on the subject property, the border plantings adjacent to those buildings shall not be considered as part of the interior landscape requirement. 
10.03.02. 
Peripheral landscaping shall be required along any side of a parking lot of twenty (20) or more spaces that abuts adjoining property that is not a right-of-way.  A landscaping strip four (4) feet in width shall be located between the parking area and the abutting property lines. One

One (1)tree shall be planted for each forty (40) linear feet of the landscaping strip. 
10.03.04. 
All parking lot landscaping shall be of such quality as to improve and enhance the site and its surrounding areas. The primary landscaping materials used in parking lots shall be trees which provide shade or are capable of providing shade at maturity.  Shrubbery, hedges andother planting material may be used to complement the tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution to the landscaping. Effective use of earth berms and existing topography is also encouraged as a component of the landscape plan. 
The landscaping and planting areas shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking lots.
The interior dimensions of any planting area or planting median shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to insure proper growth.

12.06.06.08. 
All manufactured homes (including "mobile" homes placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer) to be placed or substantially improved shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than 10 feet apart, and the provision of reinforcement for piers more than six feet above ground level. 
12.06.06.09. 
A building permit, zoning permit, site plan approval and/or special exception/permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any special flood hazard area. The applicant should review the Zoning Regulations with the Zoning Enforcement Officer to determine which permit approval process, or processes, are to be followed for the particular land use which is being proposed. 
12.06.06.10. 
In a zone where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development. 
12.06.06.11. 
Use of land, construction or other activities permitted within this Section shall be subject to approval by all applicable federal or state agencies. 
12.06.07. Specific Standards 
The following provisions shall apply in all areas of special flood hazard A1­30, AE, AH, or A zones where base flood elevation data has been provided in accordance with Sections 
12.06.05.06. or 12.06.08.#4. of these regulations. 
12.06.07.01. 
New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
12.06.07.02. 
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a) be flood­proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water: b) have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of the subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Enforcement Officer. 
12.06.07.03. 
Manufactured homes (Recreational Vehicles) shall be prohibited in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
12.06.07.04. 
Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(a) 	
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification, with supporting technical data based on hydrologic and hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with standard engineering practices, by a registered professional engineer registered in the State of Connecticut is provided 

demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00) increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 

(b) 	
All new construction and substantial improvements in the floodway shall comply with the flood hazard reduction provisions noted in this Section. 


12.06.08. Standards For Subdivision Proposals

12.06.09. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability 
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations are considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man­made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply or guarantee that land outside the special flood hazard area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Durham or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The Town of Durham, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for another person’s reliance on any maps, data or information provided by the Town of Durham. 
12.06.10. Considerations and Conditions for Granting Variances in Flood Hazard Areas 
12.06.10.01. Specific Situation Variances 
12.06.10.01.01. Buildings on an Historic Register 
Variances "may" be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, except for Section 
12.06.10.03. (a) and (d), and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical character. 
12.06.10.01.02. Pre­Existing, Small Lot Location 
Variances "may" be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one­half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with Section 
12.06.10.02. (a) and (d). 
12.06.10.01.03. Functional Dependent Uses 
Variances "may" be issued for new construction and substantial improvement and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage, create no additional threat to public safety and meet the requirements of Section 12.06.10.02. (a) and (d). 
12.06.10.02. Considerations for Granting of Variances 
In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this regulation, and: 
(a) 	
the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 

(b) 	
the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 

(c) 	
the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 

(d) 	
the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 

(e) 	
the necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 

(f) 	
the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 

(g) 	
the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 

(h) 	
the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 

(i) 	
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

(j) 	
the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and; 

(k) 	
the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 


Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of the flood hazard regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the flood hazard regulations. 
12.06.10.03. Conditions for Variances 
12.06.10.03.01. 
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
12.06.10.03.02. 
Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(a) 	
a showing of good and sufficient cause; 

(b) 	
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 

(c) 	
a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 


12.06.10.04. 
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage. 
12.06.10.05. 
The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
12.06.10.06. Adoption Date of Regulation 

See Section 14 of these regulations. 
12.06.10.07. Effective Date of Regulations

12.06.10.08. Citation of Statutory Authorization 
The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7­148 (c)(7)(A) and in Title 8. Chapter 124, Section 8­2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
12.06.10.09. Disclaimer of Liability Section 
See Section 12.06.09. of these Regulations. 
12.06.10.10. Severability Section 
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this regulation should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this regulation, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the provisions of this regulation are hereby declared to be severable. 
12.06.10.11. Abrogation and Greater Restriction Section 
This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
12.06.10.12. Compensatory Storage 
The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally influenced. shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction, or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on­site. unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100­year flood elevation. which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off­site if approved by the municipality. 
12.06.10.13. Equal Conveyance Within the floodplain. except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage or flood velocity. 
12.06.10.14. Aboveground Oil Tanks 
Above­ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie­down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water. 
12.06.10.15. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone 
If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached add itions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone. 
12.06.10.16. Structures in Two Flood Zones 
If a structure lies within two or more tlood zones, the construction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.) 
12.06.10.17. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water 
New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water. 
12.06.10.18. That For New Construction or Substantial Improvements 
Require that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit offload waters. Designs for meeting this 
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet 

or exceed the following criteria: a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

Proposed storm water drainage system. 

(15) 	
Location of all permanent monuments. 

(16) 	
A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be submitted with any application for development. (See Section 12.09 for details of a soil erosion and sediment control plan.) The plan shall conform to the minimum standards set forth in the Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (1985), as amended.  The plan may bereferred to the Middlesex Soil and Water Conservation District for review and comment. In submitting an erosion and sediment control plan, the applicant shall address the following criteria: 

(a) 	
The development plan should be fitted to the topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential. 

(b) 	
Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected. 

(c) 	
Only the smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time during development. 

(d) 	
When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time. 

(e) 	
Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching should be used to protect areas exposed during development. 

(f) 	
Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps) should be installedand maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters and from land undergo­ing development. 

(g)

(1)
 Peak discharges from the 2-year, lO-year, and lOO-year frequency, 24-hour duration, type III distribution storms shall be analyzed. No increases in peak flow from these storms shall be allowed. This may be accomplished by detention basins, roof or parking lot storage or other acceptable means. 

(2)
 The required stormwater detention volume shall be that necessary to handle the runoff from the drainage area of a lOO-year frequency, 24-hour duration, type III distribution rainfall, as published by the National Weather Service or other recognized agency, minus that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved rate as specified in (1). 

(3)
 For developments of less than 10 acres, runoff may be computed using the rational formula; in all other cases, runoff shall be computed in accordance with Technical Release #5,Urban Hydrology, Engineering Division, Soil Conversation Service, USDA, January 1975, as amended. 

(b) 	
When the Commission determines that engineering, aesthetics, and economic factors make combined retention or other drainage facilities more practical for construction by the Town, the Town shall require a fee or equivalent dedication of land which shall be used to construct these facilities. The Commission may permit several developers to construct joint facilities. 

(c) 	
Maximum infiltration to the ground water is encouraged. Design of the stormwater management system shall consider reducing runoff by use of such techniques as minimizing impervious areas and maximizing travel times by using grass or rock-lined channels in lieu of storm sewers. 

(d) 	
All on-site facilities shall be properly maintained by the owner such that they donot become nuisances. 

(e) 	
All runoff control structures located on private property whether dedicated to the Town or not shall be accessible at all times for Town inspection.  Where run­off control structures have been accepted by the Town for maintenance, access easements shall be provided. 

(f) 	
Runoff management system components shall be designed according to sound engineering principles and installed in a sequence that permits each to functionas intended without causing a hazard. Single components shall not be installeduntil plans for the entire runoff management system are completed and approved. Final discharge points shall be approved by the Commission or its authorized agent. 

(g) 	
Runoff management systems shall be visually compatible with the surroundinglandscape. 

(h) 	
Permits for runoff management systems may also be required from the Inland Wetlands Commission where such systems may have an impact on inland wetlands, and from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection where a dam is to be constructed or water diverted.

 Accessory Apartments 


The intent of this regulation is to control the creation of accessory apartments within existing single family residences for the purpose of providing affordable rental housing in the Town of Durham. This regulation is designed to ensure that in creating accessory apartments, the single family character of the principal dwelling will be retained.  Accessory apartments arefurther intended to encourage the viability of single family zones.

The non-accessory apartment portion of a single family residence shall meet the minimum floor area for the zoning district. 

(b) 	
An owner of the structure must live in the principal or accessory unit. 

(c) 	
The number of additional dwelling units is limited to one. 

(d) 	
The minimum size for an accessory unit shall be 400 square feet. 

(e)

(k) 	
It is recognized that occupancy of an accessory apartment may at some time place additional demands on the subsurface sewage disposal system through increases in water usage. For the purposes of this regulation, the creation of anaccessory apartment is a "Building Conversion".  Prior to granting an approval for such Conversion, the Durham Sanitarian must verify to the Commission that the building lot Conversion can satisfy all the current requirements of the Connecticut Public Health Code for subsurface sewage disposal and shall have available a 100% reserve area. Furthermore, an accessory apartment will not be permitted on any lot where the sewage disposal system is currently failing. Nor will the approval to continue use of an accessory apartment be renewed if the Durham Sanitarian has evidence of a sewage system failure.  Prior to the granting of an approval a water test must be conducted and coordinated with the Sanitarian's office.  The water quality must meet the same standards as thoserequired for a Certificate of Occupancy. 

(l) 	
Accessory Apartment permits shall be renewed every five years provided there has not been any violation of the provisions of this section. Requests for renewals shall be submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer on a form provided by the Town. The Zoning Enforcement Officer and Sanitarian shall make an inspection of the accessory apartment and renew the approval if it is in compliance with these regulations and the approved application.

Inland Wetlands and Watercourse Agency1 
§ 12-61. Purpose. [Ord. of 1-9-90, § 1] 
The inland wetlands and watercourses are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of theTown have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and under-ground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding anderosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to theexistence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger ofdestruction because of unregulated use by reason of deposition, filling orremoval of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted andeliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had,and will continue to have a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the Town of Durham and has and will continue to imperil thequality of the environment, thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic,historic and recreational values and benefits of the Town for its citizens now and forevermore. The preservation and protection of the wetlandsand watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulateduses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the Town.

6:41 

§ 14-93 DURHAM CODE 	§ 14-94 
feet, five numbers on the left side, alternating odd and even every 20feet. Buildings will be assigned a number based upon the number block in which the front door of the building is situated in the space betweennumber blocks, it shall be assigned the lower available number. 
(b) 	Application of the numbering system to types of streets. 
(1) 	
Streets running from north-south axis. For streets running north orsouth from the axis, the point of origin will be the intersection ofthe street with the axis. If the street runs north of the axis, the right or odd side will be the easterly side of the street and the left oreven side will be the westerly side of the street. If the street runssouth of the axis, the right or odd side will be the westerly side of the street and the left or even side will be the easterly side of the street. 

(2) 	
Streets running from east-west axis. For streets running east or west from this axis, the point of origin will be the intersection of thestreet with the axis. If the street runs west of the axis, the right orodd side will be the northerly side of the street and the left or even side will be the southerly side of the street. If the street runs eastof the axis, the right or odd side will be the southerly side of thestreet and the left or even side of the street will be the northerly side of the street.

For example, for Tri-Mountain Road as its northerly terminusintersected with Route 68 and it were a street that ran south from the north-south axis. 

(4) 	
Dead-end streets. For dead-end streets the point of origin will bethe intersection of the dead-end street with the through street to which it connects. The ROLE rule would be applied by standing atthe point of origin and facing towards the end of the street. 

(5) 	
North-south axis. For those portions of the north-south axis other than Main Street, the ROLE rule will be applied as if the point oforigin were the intersection of the axis and Main Street and thenumbers will ascend in proportion to the distance from the central point. 

(6) 	
East-west axis. The buildings on the eastwest axis will be numberedas if the point of origin were the central Town line or north towards the Middletown Town line when applying the ROLE rule, and thenumbers will ascend in either direction in proportion to the distance from the central point.

03.01. INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF SUBDIVISION
The Commission strongly recommends that prior to the submission of an official application for approval of a subdivision or resubdivision, the applicant prepare and present a preliminary plan of the subdivision or resubdivision for informal consideration by the Commission. The preparation of the preliminary plan is recommended to facilitate general consideration of factors and problems affecting development of the land to be subdivided or resubdivided before the applicant proceeds with the official application and the preparation of the final maps, plans and documents required for formal consideration by the Commission. If the subdivision plan is presented in preliminary rather than in final form, any alterations or changes recommended by the Commission may be made more readily and economically by the applicant. Neither the preliminary plan nor the informal consideration by the Commission, however, shall be deemed to constitute any portion of the official and formal procedure of applying for or approval of subdivisions or resubdivisions of land as contemplated under the provisions of the General Statutes of Connecticut. This procedure is not a requirement for the submission of an application for subdivision.
While the informal discussion procedure is optional, if pursued, all of the information listed below will be expected by the Commission. NOTE: Any suggestions or opinions rendered by the Commission are advisory only.
a. Name of the applicant;
b. Name of the owner of record;
c. Address of property being subdivided;
d. Date, north arrow, scale, Town, State and total area of parcel proposed for subdivision;
e. Names of abutting property owners, and all property owners shown on the current tax assessors records and all structures within 150' of the proposed subdivision;
f. Existing and proposed street locations;
g. Proposed lots with approximate dimensions and area;
3 - 1
h. Proposed lot numbers, street names, easement areas, open space parcels and rights-of-way;
i. Proposed well and subsurface sewage disposal system locations;
j. Proposed storm drainage network and their connections to existing facilities;
k. Topographic data (in accordance with Town topographic maps) including streams, ponds, watercourses, marshes and other such water bodies;
l. Significant physical features of the land including ledge outcroppings, stone walls, existing structures, ridge lines, vistas, etc.
m. Location of inland wetland areas, watercourses, flood plain boundaries and/or flood hazard area boundaries;
n. Name and certification of the person responsible for the preparation of the plans.
o. Zoning district and zoning district boundaries, if applicable.
Preliminary drawings may be based upon the Tax Assessor's Maps or a Class "D" Survey. The source of the data shall be noted on the drawing.
Four (4) paper prints of the informal discussion drawings shall be submitted to the Commission's Clerk for informal review by the Commission. The prints should be accompanied by a memo indicating that the informal discussion procedure is being pursued and a request to be placed on a regular meeting agenda. Subject to normal work load constraints, the Commission will make every effort to schedule an informal discussion for the next regular meeting.
A print of the Middlesex County Soils Survey showing soil classifications as they relate to the proposed subdivision is recommended. Where there is a question about soil classifications, it is recommended that the developer contact the Middlesex County Soil and Water Conservation District prior to the informal discussion.
The Commission may discuss whatever layout changes it feels are necessary to eliminate or improve any problems relating to health, fire safety, traffic safety and storm drainage, as well as provisions for future streets.
03.02. APPLICATION

No increases in peak flow from these storms shall be allowed. This may be accomplished by detention basins, rooftop storage, parking lot coverage, underground tanks or other effective methods.
3 - 9
2) The overall drainage system shall be designed such that the run-off rate outside the subdivision, during or after development, does not exceed the rate that existed prior to development. This may be accomplished by retention basins, infiltration basins or other acceptable means as approved by the Town Engineer.
3) Maximum infiltration to groundwater is encouraged. Design of the stormwater management system shall consider reducing run-off by use of such techniques as minimizing impervious areas and maximizing travel times by using grass or rock-lined channels in lieu of storm sewers.
4) For drainage areas of less than ten (10) acres, run-off may be calculated using the Rational Method. In all other cases, run-off shall be computed in accordance with Technical Release #55, Urban Hydrology, Engineering Division, Soil Conservation Service, USDA, January 1975, as amended, or other recognized methods approved by the Town Engineer.
5) Stormwater management system components shall be designed according to sound engineering principles and installed in a sequence that permits each to function as intended without causing a hazard. Single components shall not be installed until plans for the entire run-off management system are completed and approved. Final discharge points shall be approved by the Commission.
6) All run-off control structures located on private property, whether dedicated to the Town or not, shall be accessible at all times for Town inspection. Where run-off control structures have been accepted by the Town for maintenance, improved access easements shall be provided.
7) Stormwater management systems shall be visually compatible with the surrounding landscape.
8) Permits for stormwater management systems may also be required from the Inland Wetlands and Water Courses Agency where such systems may have an impact on inland wetlands, and from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection where a dam is to be constructed or water diverted (see Sections 22a-365 et seq. and 22a-409 of the Connecticut General Statutes).

Effective Date: 5/1/04
SECTION 04. SUBDIVISION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
04.01. GENERAL PLANNING AND DESIGN
04.01.01. Character of Subdivision Land
1) Proposed building lots shall be of such shape, size, location, topography and character that buildings can be constructed reasonably, occupied and used for building purposes without danger to the health, safety and general welfare of the occupants and the public. Proposed building lots shall be designed and arranged to make the best use of the natural terrain, to avoid unnecessary regrading, to protect the natural environment and to preserve natural features such as ridge lines, water bodies, watercourses, and vegetation. The proposed grading of a lot which involves the creation of steep slopes and/or banks which result in changes of grade in excess of fifteen (15) feet and at a slope of 1:1 or greater, or mining of bedrock in excess of one (1,000) thousand cubic yards, or excavation and/or filling in excess of five (5) feet in depth over sixty (60) percent of the lot shall be considered inconsistent with this section and a possible threat to public health and safety and shall be subject to the provisions of 03.05.30).
2) Land unsuitable for building purposes due to conditions such as difficult drainage, configuration, inaccessibility, temporary flooding, erosion, steeply sloping topography, swamps, high groundwater level or because of potential danger to health or public safety or peril from fire or floods, shall not be platted for residential or other uses that may increase danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate the flood hazard, unless appropriate corrective measures have been taken by the subdivider to eliminate such hazards in accordance with the applicable provisions of these regulations.
3) Except for open space areas specifically approved by the Commission, no land that is rendered useless for building due to easements, watercourses, topography, or failure to meet public health code requirements for on-site sewage disposal or water supply shall be shown as a lot on any subdivision plan. Such lands shall be included in adjoining lots.
4) Work on any proposed building lot requiring the excavation and removal of more than 1,000 cubic yards of any earth or mineral
4 - 1
product shall comply with Section 12.05., Sand and Gravel Pits, of the Durham Zoning Regulations.
04.01.02. Reserve Strips
No privately owned, reserved strip of land shall be permitted which would control or impede access to any part of the subdivision or adjacent land from any street or open space reserved for dedication or for any other use.
04.01.03. Preservation of Natural Features
The general layout and design of the subdivision shall avoid, to the maximum extent possible, large scale changes in topography and watercourse locations. The applicant shall demonstrate a conscious effort to preserve and enhance natural features, such as vegetation, watercourses, paths, scenic points, ridge lines and other natural assets. Particular attention shall be given to preserving selected trees and shrubs.
04.01.04. Landscaping
The natural features of the site shall be preserved to the fullest extent possible and the felling of trees shall be held to a minimum. The developer shall leave not less than two (2) naturally growing shade trees having a 1 1/2 - 2 inch or larger caliper in the front yard of each lot or shall plant two (2) shade trees of similar caliper approximately ten (10) feet from the front property line, so that the planting of such trees shall not conflict with the placement of underground utilities. The above shall be shown on the site plan or on a landscaping plan.
Street trees having a 1 1/2 - 2 inch caliper shall be planted along both sides of the street line, spaced approximately fifty (50) feet apart. Again, the spacing of such trees shall not conflict with the location of underground utilities.
In lieu of the above, the Commission may consider the existing vegetation found on the site.
The above requirements shall be imposed on all subdivisions or resubdivisions on existing and proposed streets.
On any thoroughfare requiring a center island, a landscaping plan showing such island shall be submitted as part of the subdivision plan. Plantings and landscaping requiring a minimum amount of maintenance shall be proposed for center islands.
4 - 2
04.02. OPEN SPACE
The purpose of this Section is to ensure that the Town is able to preserve areas containing significant natural features as well as areas designated for use as open space or for recreational purposes. To implement the above, the Commission shall review the subdivision application and determine if open space dedication is warranted based on the criteria outlined in Section 04.02.01. The Commission shall also determine which of the following methods of dedication shall be appropriate (in no case shall the Commission require more than ten (10) percent of the total subdivision area):
(1) The dedication of land to the Town of Durham or another entity approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, such as a land trust or association of the subdivision lot owners; or
(2) The preservation of land in the form of scenic or conservation easements; or
(3) A combination of the above which the Commission may deem appropriate.
In general, the outright dedication of land shall not be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless it is adjacent to an existing Town-owned open space parcel or property dedicated for recreational use.
If the applicant is able to demonstrate that the open space dedication would reduce the total number of lots in the subdivision, that portion of the open space dedication shall be reduced so that the lot yield will not be affected.
04.02.01. Open Space Objectives
The following objectives should be used as a guide in the general layout of a proposed subdivision containing public or private open space:
(1) Open space, conservation areas and recreation areas shown in the Town's Plan of Development should be considered in the subdivision layout;
(2) Natural features and vegetation, such as ridge lines, areas of archeological significance, wildlife corridors, wetland areas, stream belts, aquifers or other areas with natural
4 - 3
significance, as found on the site or as outlined in the Town's Plan of Development should be preserved;
(3) Property adjacent to existing Town-owned open space or recreation areas should be expanded wherever possible.
04.02.02. Standards for Open Space
(1) The Commission may require open space areas to abut a public street or have direct access to a public street via a right-of-way or easement dedicated to public use.
(2) When a property line of a subdivision abuts an existing park, or open space, the Commission may require new open space lines to be a continuation of the existing open space to form a single, large, unified area.
(3) Any land dedicated to the Town for a public playground or park, that is improved for recreational purposes, shall be graded to properly dispose of surface water and landscaped in a manner consistent with the intended use. All brush and debris shall be removed and the land left in a condition for the purposes intended.
(4) The Commission shall have final approval of the layout of any open space areas to be dedicated to the Town.
(5) All improvements on a parcel to be deeded to the Town shall be included in the total amount to be bonded for subdivision improvements.
04.02.03. Alternative Open Space Dedication
(1) If, in the judgment of the Commission, the required open space may be properly and more advantageously located in a future section of a development, the Commission may grant a delay of this provision provided the developer shall provide preliminary plans and enter into an agreement to dedicate the area of land in the future section for open space. The Commission shall require a deed or easement to be executed for the land prior to final approval of the subdivision plan.
If the future section is not planned for development within five (5) years of the date of the subdivision approval, the developer shall deed the required open space land to the Town (either by outright dedication or easement). A right-of-way providing access to the property shall also be included in the dedication. This covenant shall be binding upon the developer and any subsequent owners of the remaining land.
4 - 4
(2) Open space land to be deeded to the Town, by either outright dedication or easement, need not necessarily be contiguous with the parcel being subdivided. Other property may be suggested by the developer and accepted by the Commission if, in the Commission's judgment, community needs will be better served. Such land must be in the control of the developer.
04.02.04. Exceptions
The Commission may waive the requirements of this section if the minimum total parcel size proposed for subdivision is less than ten (10) acres.
04.03. LOT DESIGN
Building lots should be arranged and located to create and preserve unique characteristics for the building sites, to utilize the existing topography to the maximum degree possible, to maximize the environmental privacy of each building site, to provide each building site with safe and convenient vehicular access, and to avoid the use of land unsuitable for building sites.
04.03.01. Minimum Lot Dimensions
Minimum lot sizes as to depth, width and areas, in any particular district, shall not be less than those sizes required by the Town of Durham, Connecticut, Zoning Regulations for the district in which the subdivision is located. Wherever possible, lot lines shall be perpendicular to straight street lines or radial to curving street lines. Where the front line is an arc, or the side lines converge toward the front lines, the width shall be measured along the minimum front yard setback line parallel to the front
line, and if it is an arc, then along the arc of a circle drawn at the minimum front yard.
04.03.02. Lot Numbers
All lots shall be numbered beginning with the numeral "1" and shall continue consecutively throughout the entire subdivision with no omissions or duplications. No fractions or letters shall be used, even in the case of resubdivisions.
Adjoining sections of a subdivision having the same title shall not duplicate numbers but shall continue the sequence of numbers used previously for the adjoining land. All lot numbers shall be conspicuous and noted on the map in the approximate center of the lots.
4 - 5
04.03.03. Energy Efficiency and Solar Access
The applicant shall demonstrate to the Commission that he has considered, in developing the plan, the use of passive solar energy techniques. Passive solar energy techniques mean site design techniques which maximize solar heat gain, minimize heat loss and provide thermal storage within a building during the heating season, while minimizing heat gain and providing for natural ventilation during the cooling season. The site design techniques shall include, but not be limited to: (1) house orientations; (2) street and lot layout; (3) vegetation; (4) natural and man-made topographical features; and (5) protection of solar access within the development.
04.03.04. Street Access
All lots shall have frontage on (1) State highways; (2) roads maintained by the Town of Durham; (3) roads which are to be built as part of a subdivision in accordance with these regulations; and (4) unimproved public roads, public highways or public ways over which the developer has a right of access under Connecticut law.
04.04. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING STREETS
Proposed subdivisions and any proposed streets therein shall be planned to coordinate with existing streets as follows:
04.04.01. Abutting Streets
Proposed subdivisions abutting an existing Town road or State highway right-of-way shall provide for proper widening of the right-of-way of such road or highway to the width appropriate for the classification given such road or highway by the Commission. Provisions shall also be made for improvements in the travel way as to width, grade and alignment (vertical and horizontal), base, drainage and pavement as may be necessary for the creation of the subdivision.
04.04.02. Access
Any proposed street in a subdivision shall connect to an existing Town road or State highway or to another street in the proposed subdivision or to a street in another subdivision approved by the Commission where the applicant has access rights.
4 - 6
04.04.03. Suitability of Access
The existing street to which the proposed subdivision street connects shall be of sufficient width and have a suitable travel way, grade, alignment and line of sight to provide adequate access for fire protection, other emergency, utility and highway maintenance services to the subdivision and shall be sufficient to accept the traffic to be generated by the proposed subdivision street without undue hazards to vehicles or pedestrians.
04.05. CONSTRUCTION OF NEW ROADS
When a new street is proposed within a subdivision, the following information shall be supplied:
1) Plan-Profile drawings prepared on 24" x 36" plan-profile sheets to a scale of 1" = 40' horizontal and 1" = 4' vertical, showing:
a) The location and dimensions of existing and proposed street rights-of-way, edges of pavement, curbs, sidewalks, piping, catch basins, manholes, endwalls, bridges, utilities and utility easements, drainage easements, open channels, monuments, tops and toes of all slopes; all data required for accurate layout of roadway center lines and rights-of-way, including stationing, bearings, tangent lengths, arc lengths, radii and central angles of all curves; the location of property lines intersecting the street right-of-way lines and the names of owners of adjacent properties; cross-sections of each street at intervals of fifty (50) feet for design purposes, showing proposed dimensions and materials for construction and locations of drainage piping;
b) Profiles of existing ground surface at the center line and at each right-of-way line;
c) Profiles of the proposed center line showing proposed grades, vertical curve data and stations at grade changes, intersections and at intervals of fifty (50) feet;
d) Profiles of all existing and proposed drainage facilities, bridges and other proposed improvements
4 - 7
showing locations, sizes, grades and invert elevations.
2) A drainage report including a drainage analysis map (basis of design), detailed design computations and an analysis of the effect of proposed road and drainage facility construction as well as land development associated with existing downstream drainage facilities and adjacent properties. The detailed design computations shall show the design criteria, parameters and methods used in selecting the location, configuration, type and size of all proposed drainage facilities. Such computations shall include tabulated summaries of pertinent design computations.
3) Detailed drawings of all bridges, box culverts, retaining walls and other special drainage structures;
4) Landscaping plans for the landscaping of center islands, turn-arounds, median strips and other areas within the right-of-way lines of the road.
04.05.01. Road Design
The purpose of these standards is to assure that proposed roads shall be in harmony with existing or other proposed roads with regard to smooth traffic flow and safe intersections with such roads. As far as practicable, roads shall follow natural contours. Where the land to be subdivided abuts a street as defined in Section 02.19.04. of these Regulations, the street shall conform to the standards and specifications set forth herein. Where the land to be subdivided does not abut a street as defined by Section 02.19.04. of these Regulations, the subdivider shall, as the Planning and Zoning Commission may determine, either: (1) provide and construct a road from the subdivision to a town or state road, in accordance with the standards and specifications contained herein; or (2) widen, alter or improve an existing road in accordance with the standards and specifications contained herein.
Functional Classification
The basis for determining the applicable standards for any road in the Town of Durham will be the road's functional classification as defined below:
Collector: A collector road collects traffic from local access roads and channels traffic to principal arterials such as Routes 17, 68, 77 and 79. It provides for traffic movement between areas of town, arterials and local access roads. A collector customarily receives traffic from more than two (2) local access roads or
4 - 8
provides circulation within commercial or industrial areas. Roads designed to accommodate present or at any future time traffic other than that generated in the area shall be classified as collectors. All roads within commercial or industrial areas will be classified as collectors (examples: Foot Hills Road, Higganum Road, Howd Road, Johnson Lane, Maiden Lane, Parmelee Hill Road, Tri-mountain Road).
Local Access: A local access road provides direct access to abutting property and neighborhoods and access to collector roads.
Local Access (Permanent Dead End): A local access (permanent dead end) road provides direct access to abutting property, and there is no possibility of extension of the road at a future time.
Design Standards
These standards have been developed based on the concept of providing safe travel at the design speed specified for the functional classification of the road. When no standard exists for a given feature of the roadway, this concept shall prevail, and the roadway feature shall be designed based upon the specified design speed.
The following table is a summary of the criteria to be considered when designing roads in the Town of Durham:

or: 11.75 x (85th Percentile Speed)
Whichever is Greater
NOTE: Where field conditions dictate that to obtain the required sight distance based on the observed 85th percentile speeds would have significant adverse environmental, historical or cultural impact; the maximum attainable intersection sight distance (ISD), as outlined in The Connecticut Department of Transportation Guidelines for Highway Design, January 1990, Table T3-1.03a, "Intersection Sight Distance Criteria", and as determined by the Commission based on existing field conditions, road geometry and historical impact, shall be enforced. This value shall be greater than the minimum tabular ISD value based on design speed.
See Figure 1 for Intersection Sight Distance Details.
Local access roads should be designed to minimize through traffic movements and reduce average traffic speeds. This can be best accomplished by designing offset and "T" type intersections as opposed to four (4) way intersections.
There shall be a maximum of four (4) approaches to an intersection. Intersections shall be spaced so as to minimize potential traffic conflicts, particularly in the case of intersections with routes such as State highways. Intersections shall be spaced a minimum of 200' apart.
Storm Drainage Intersections
Where the development streets join existing Town roads, the developer shall provide drainage at the intersections as directed by the Town Engineer.
Minimum Pavement Structure

Rock Cuts
In the case of improvements to be made to an existing Town road that is classified as either a local access road or a local access (permanent dead-end) road, the required pavement layers may be reduced as follows:
If the number of residences proposed on the road is between eleven (11) and twenty-five (25), construction of the pavement surface course and the bituminous curb may be deferred, with either the Town or future developers becoming responsible for the costs of constructing the surface course and curbs.
If the number of residences proposed on the road is ten (10) or less, the pavement layers may be omitted and replaced by a 1" layer of compacted stone screenings.
Additional Requirements
All roads will be constructed with a cross slope of 1/4" per foot, drained from the centerline of the road toward the curb.
Six (6) inch bituminous concrete curbs will be constructed on both sides of all paved roads.
Roadway side slopes will be designed with a minimum of a 5' shelf behind the curb with a maximum slope of 1"/foot.
Maximum fill and cut slopes will be 2:1 (horizontal:vertical). If fill height exceeds 4', guide railing will be provided, or slopes will be flattened to 4:1. Guide railing shall be placed 4' from the back of the curb.
No zoning permit, other than for a foundation, shall be issued until the first course of the wearing surface has been applied in accordance with the "Specifications for Road and Street
4 - 12
Construction, Town of Durham, Connecticut" as amended.
Figure 2 shows the typical cross section for roads with curbing.
Figure 3 shows the typical cross section for existing Town roads where no curbing is to be constructed.
04.05.02. Cul-de-Sacs or Dead End Road
Cul-de-Sacs or Dead End Road - A road having only one intersection with another road and having a turnaround entirely surrounded on its frontage with separate lots.
A temporary turnaround shall be provided on all temporary cul-de-sacs roads, with a notation on the subdivision map that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued.
Permanent dead-end roads may be permitted provided such design will not (1) cause undue concentrations of traffic, (2) will not be prejudicial to the needs of public health and safety by unduly delaying or inhibiting access to lots and (3) the applicant has demonstrated that any proposed dead-end road is the only road layout that is both feasible and prudent.
Any permanent or temporary dead-end road which exceeds 1,200 feet, or provides frontage for 24 lots or dwelling units as measured from the center of the turn-around from the edge of pavement to center of the pavement of the nearest intersecting through street shall provide for adequate fire protection measures and access for emergency services, if acceptable to the Commission. Off-site improvements may be constructed to meet the requirement if acceptable to the Commission and the applicant.
All permanent or temporary dead-end roads shall terminate in a turnaround with a right-of-way of 110 feet in diameter, 90 feet of which shall be paved and in conformance with Figure 4, "Town of Durham, Cul-de-Sac Detail".
An alternative cul-de-sac design, utilizing a center island, may be considered by the Commission provided plans for an 18 foot roadway surrounding the cul-de-sac (minimum), are recommended for approval to the Commission by the Town Engineer. Note: All such designs shall be reviewed by the Town Engineer for suitability on a case by case basis.
04.06. LOT ACCESS 4 - 13
It must be demonstrated that the proposed development or house site on each lot can be accessible from a public or private road via its own driveway in accordance with Section 04.07. (Driveways) utilizing its own frontage.
04.07. DRIVEWAYS
Driveways shall have a minimum curb radius of five (5) feet. All driveways shall have a maximum grade of fifteen (15) percent and shall be constructed of a minimum of eight (8) inches of gravel. All driveways that exceed a ten (10) percent grade shall be surfaced with a minimum of one and one half (1 1/2) inches, compacted depth, of bituminous concrete or oil penetration, recommended for approval to the Commission by the Town Engineer. All driveway aprons within ten (10) feet of the road curb line on paved roads shall be paved.
Whether a driveway has a positive or negative grade, the entrance to the driveway should slope up from the gutter four (4) to six (6) feet or an acceptable alternative such as additional road drains shall be provided, as approved by the Town Engineer, to prevent roadway surface drainage from entering the property.
To allow safe exit from a driveway, adequate sight distance must be provided. The criteria for intersection sight distance as noted in the road design standards also applies to driveways. Wherever possible, these distances should be attained and no less than safe stopping sight distance will be accepted.
04.08. SIDEWALKS
Sidewalks, when required by the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall be four (4) feet wide and shall be constructed on an eight (8) inch gravel base. In commercial zones, places of assembly or any other area that generates a high volume of pedestrian traffic, sidewalks shall be surfaced with five (5) inches of portland cement concrete. In all other areas, sidewalks shall be surfaced with two (2) inches of bituminous concrete or other acceptable alternative as approved by the Commission.
04.09. STREET LIGHTS
Street lights shall be located at a minimum of all road intersections and at the end of cul-de-sacs. Lights shall be installed in accordance with the latest recommendations of the
4 - 14
Illuminating Engineering Society's American National Standard Practice. Standards and luminaries shall be designed to blend with the character and architecture of the area.
04.10. OTHER UTILITIES
All utility systems and facilities (which shall include electric, gas, telephone and cable TV) shall be located underground and constructed so as to minimize the need for later adjustment and to permit servicing with a minimum amount of interference with road traffic. Installations running parallel to the road will be located outside the curb area. Facilities under the pavement will be limited to lateral service connections. If it is anticipated that additional utilities will be required, sleeves shall be provided under the full width of the road prior to the placement of pavement.
04.11. STORM DRAINAGE
04.11.01. General
Roadway drainage shall be sufficient to carry run-off from the road surface and divert water beneath or around the road without causing sedimentation, erosion or impounding of water on property upstream.
Storm drain culvert sizes shall be designed on a storm drainage frequency of ten (10) years or greater. Storm drain culverts will be designed to flow full or less than full using the Manning formula. The minimum storm drain culvert diameter shall be fifteen (15) inches.
Cross culverts shall be designed based on a fifty (50) year frequency storm, with the effects of a one hundred (100) year frequency storm evaluated to insure that no erosion will take place and that the road will not be inundated. The minimum cross culvert pipe diameter will be twenty-four (24) inches.
All open pipe ends shall be treated with either a headwall or a flared end.
Gutter flow analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the width of gutter flow will not exceed six (6) feet in a ten (10) year frequency storm. In no case shall catch basins be spaced so that flow is unintercepted for a distance greater than three hundred (300) feet.
A minimum of twenty-four (24) inches of cover shall be provided over all storm drain culverts. All changes in direction or grade shall be made in a manhole or catch basin.
4 - 15
The minimum velocity in a pipe shall be 2.5 feet per second. The maximum velocity in a pipe shall be fifteen (15) feet per second. Pipe flows with velocities over ten (10) feet per second shall require drop structures to dissipate the velocity at manholes and catch basins.
The velocity of flow in an open channel shall be restricted to 2.5 feet per second for grass channels and ten (10) feet per second for rip-rap protected channels.
Underdrains shall be required in all areas in which soil test data indicates ground water within three (3) feet of the finished pavement surface in areas adjacent to the road. Underdrains may be recommended by the Town Engineer in other locations as dictated by field conditions. Provisions shall be made for connection of
foundation underdrains to roadway underdrains by providing "T" connections.
The overall drainage system shall be designed so that the run-off rate outside of the subdivision during or after development does not exceed the rate that existed prior to development. This may be accomplished by retention basins, infiltration basins or other acceptable means as recommended by the Town Engineer.
When stormwater discharges into areas designated as inland wetlands or watercourses, plans shall be submitted to the Inland Wetlands and Water Courses Agency for comments and approval.
Where the subdivision storm drainage system is proposed to discharge into a Town storm drainage system, the developer shall make provisions to accommodate the anticipated additional discharge in the event that the Town system is not adequate. Necessary improvements to the Town system to accommodate new subdivision stormwater discharges may be required at the expense of the developer.
04.11.02. Easements and Rights to Drain
1) Rights to Drain--The developer shall obtain drainage rights, when necessary, for flows across adjacent properties. The rights shall include provisions for the Town to enter and maintain the existing or proposed facilities if the system is to be accepted by the Town.
2) Easements--Drainage easements shall be required for any part
of the storm drainage system located outside of the street right-of-way (excluding building drains and private drains).
4 - 16

(2) Provide appropriate headings and titles for sections and other
subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make
changes in such headings and titles;
(3) Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to
be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new
material, change existing or other subdivision numbers;
(4) Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning
to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may
be, or to "sections _____ through _____" (inserting section numbers
to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive
sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in
no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect
of ordinance material included in the supplement or already in the
Code.
(d) The Town Clerk shall cause copies of each and every such reprint to be
distributed to each distributee and to every purchaser of the Code who

authority vested in him by law or ordinance, any act is prohibited or is
declared to be unlawful or an offense or the doing of any act is required
or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific
penalty is provided, the violation of such ordinance, rule or regulation
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $100. Each day any such
violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
(b) The imposition of any punishment in this section shall not prevent the
enforced abatement of any lawful condition by the Town.
(c) Any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the
provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a new and
separate offense, and each day that such condition continues shall be
regarded as such.
§ 1-11. Certain ordinances not affected by Code. [Ord. of
11-29-88(2)]

7-152c to be followed in all instances when citations are issued by the
Town of Durham municipal officials.
(b) Citation officers. A person who is expressly appointed as a citation
officer by the First Selectman or who in his or her official duties has the
authority to enforce the applicable municipal regulation or ordinance
that is subject to this citation section are citation officers and shall have
the authority to issue citations in accordance with this section.
§ 1-10 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 1-12
AO:37
(c) Initial citation notice. Any person receiving a citation issued under
any regulation or ordinance of the Town shall be allowed a thirty-day
uncontested period from his/her receipt of the citation to make an
uncontested payment of the fine, penalty, cost or fee specified in the
citation to the Town. If the citation is mailed by regular or certified mail,
the day of receipt of the citation shall be deemed to be three business
days after the day of mailing of the citation. Such uncontested payment
shall be inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish
the conduct of such person or other person making the payment.
(d) Second citation notice and notice of right of hearing. If a person who
has been issued a citation does not make uncontested payment of the
fine, penalty, cost or fee specified in the citation to the Town within the
time allowed under Subsection (c) above, the Town shall send notice to
the alleged violator no later than 12 months after the expiration of the
final period for the uncontested payment of the fine, penalty, cost or fee
for any citation issued under any regulation or ordinance of the Town
for an alleged violation, informing the violator and any other persons
cited of the following:
(1) The allegations against the violator and other persons cited and the
amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees due;
(2) That the alleged violator or other person cited may contest his/her
liability by delivering in person or by mail written notice within 10
days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to this Subsection (d) to
said violator that he/she desires to contest his/her liability before a
citation hearing officer;
(3) That if the alleged violator does not demand such a hearing, an
assessment and judgment shall be entered against him/her; and
(4) That such judgment may issue without further notice.
(e) Payment without hearing. If the alleged violator or other person to
whom notice has been sent pursuant to Subsection (d) above wishes to
admit liability for any alleged violation, he/she may, without requesting
a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees in
person or by mail to the official designated by the Town.
(f) Assessment by default. A person who either (i) has been issued a section
citation notice in accordance with Subsection (d) above and who does
not deliver or mail a written demand for a hearing within 10 days of
the date of that second notice, or (ii) requests a hearing but fails to
appear at a duly noticed hearing as required by Subsection (g)(1) below,
shall be deemed to have admitted liability. The designated municipal
official shall enter a default assessment of the fines, penalties, costs or
fees provided for by law by default after making such findings that the
applicable notice was duly issued. The hearing officer shall then file a
certified copy of the assessment with the superior court in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Subsection (g)(2) below.
(g) Hearing procedure.
(1) Any person who requests a hearing in writing shall be given written
notice of the date, time and place for the hearing. Such hearing
shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from
the date of the mailing of such notice, provided that the hearing
§ 1-12 DURHAM CODE § 1-12
AO:38
officer shall grant, upon good cause shown, any reasonable request
by an interested party for postponement or continuance. An original
or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the
issuing officer shall be filed and retained by the Town, shall be
deemed to be a business record within the scope of C.G.S. § 52-180
and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the
issuing officer shall be required at the hearing if such person so
requests. The alleged violator or other person wishing to contest
liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in
his/her behalf. A designated Town official, other than the hearing
officer, may present evidence on behalf of the Town. The hearing
officer may accept from such alleged violator copies of documents
by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such
person is unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing
in the order and form and with such methods of proof as he/she
deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility
of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be
given under oath or affirmation. The hearing officer shall announce
his/her decision at the end of the hearing. If he/she determines that
the alleged violator is not liable, he/she shall dismiss the matter
and enter his/her determination in writing accordingly. If he/she
determines that the person is liable for the violation, he/she shall
forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs or fees against
such person as provided by the ordinance.
(2) If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing
officer shall send by first-class mail a notice of the assessment
to the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days
nor more than 12 months after such mailing, a certified copy of
the notice of assessment with the clerk of the superior court for
the geographical area in which the Town is located, together with
an entry fee. The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall
constitute a record of the assessment. Within such 12-month period,
assessments against the same person may be accrued and filed
as one record of assessment. The clerk of the court shall enter
judgment in the amount of such record of assessment and court
costs against such person in favor of the Town. Notwithstanding
any other provision of the General Statutes, the hearing officer's
assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect
of a civil money judgment and a levy of execution of such judgment
may issue without further notice to such person.
(3) The person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant
to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal. An
appeal shall be instituted within 30 days of the mailing of notice of
such assessment by filing a petition to reopen assessment, together
with an entry fee in an amount equal to the entry fee for a small
claims case pursuant to C.G.S. § 52-259, in the superior court for the
geographical area in which the Town is located, which shall entitle
such person to a hearing in accordance with the rules of the judges
of the superior court.
§ 1-12 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 1-12
AO:39
(h) Hearing officer appointment. The Board of Selectmen shall appoint one

this section, to conduct the hearings authorized by this section. All such
officers shall serve for a term of two years.

under this section for any single violation shall not exceed the amount
of $100 per day, unless otherwise specifically provided by the particular

the State of Connecticut, or the Town of Durham;
b. A cross-connection with the public water supply is identified by
the Town of Durham; or
c. EPA or CT DEEP notify the Town of Durham Department of

ARTICLE III
Regulation Of Adult-Oriented Establishments
§ 9-61. Findings and purpose. [Ord. of 1-24-00, § 1]
(a) There are, or may in the future be, "adult-oriented establishments"
located in the Town which require special supervision from the Town's
public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve the health, safety
and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the health,
safety and welfare of the Town's citizens.
(b) Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and
Towns in the United States indicate that:
(1) Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such "adultoriented
establishments" especially those which provide closed
booths, cubicles, studies and rooms for the private viewing of socalled
"adult" motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live
entertainment; and
(2) Persons under the age of 18 may be attracted to adult-oriented
establishments and seek to enter or loiter about them without the
knowledge or permission of their parents or guardians; and
(3) Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used
by patrons, clients or customers of such "adult-oriented
establishments" for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts;
and
(4) Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such
establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients
or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles
and rooms; and
(5) Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the
entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios, and rooms
which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms
are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios
and rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes or
others, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the
commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and urine to be
deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios
and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health
and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such
deposits; and
(6) The reasonable regulation and supervision of such "adult-oriented
establishments" tends to discourage such sexual acts and
prostitution, and thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of
the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments.
(7) The nature of "adult-oriented establishments" and the traffic which
they generate, and the potential and the propensity for such
establishments to attract persons interested in explicit sexual
activities or erotic art forms, and the potential for outdoor assembly
of such persons around the premises of such establishments, are
such as to make them incompatible with nearby uses of land where
concentrations of children or youth tend to congregate;
§ 9-61 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 9-61
AO:91
(c) The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments including,
without limitations, those specifically cited at Subsection (b)(1) hereof,
is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of
the citizens of the Town.
(d) The Constitution and laws of the state grant to the Town powers,
especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures
to regulate and supervise "adult-oriented establishments" as hereinafter
defined in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
(e) It is not the intent of the Town, in enacting this ordinance, to deny to
any person rights to speech protected by the United States and/or State
Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the Town to impose any additional
limitations or restrictions on the contents or any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented films, video tapes, books and/
or other materials. Further, by enacting this section, the Town does
not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain and/
or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States
and/or State Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any
constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such
sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such
materials.

Right to Farm
§ 11-74. Purpose and intent. [Ord. of 1-14-13, § I]
Agriculture plays a significant role in Durham's heritage and future. The
Town officially recognizes the importance of farming to its rural quality of
life, heritage, public health, scenic vistas, tax base, wetlands, wildlife, and
local economy. This article encourages the pursuit of agriculture, promotes
agriculture-based economic opportunities, and protects farmland within
Durham by allowing agricultural uses and related activities to function with
minimal conflict with neighbors and Town agencies.
It is therefore the declared policy of the Town of Durham and the Durham
Agricultural Commission to conserve and protect agricultural land, to
encourage agricultural operations and the sale of local farm products within
the Town of Durham. It is the purpose and intent of this article to promote
and advance the Town's policy and reduce the loss of local agricultural
resources by limiting circumstances under which any such operation may
be considered a nuisance. Methods of farming that comport with generally
accepted farming practices are also deemed consistent with community
standards. This article is not to be construed as modifying or abridging
state law relative to the abatement of nuisances, but is to be used in the
interpretation and characterization of activities and in the considering and
implementing enforcement of the provisions of the Code of Ordinances of
the Town of Durham and other applicable State of Connecticut and Town
regulations, consistent with the provisions of G.S. § 19a-341. Additionally,
the terms of this article may be used in determining whether the methods
and practices that may come under review conform to community
standards.
§ 11-75. Declaration. [Ord. of 1-14-13, § II]
The right to farm is hereby recognized to exist within the Town of Durham.
No present or future agricultural operation conducted or maintained in a
manner consistent with generally accepted agricultural practices which is
engaged in the act of farming as described in this article shall become or
considered a nuisance solely because such activity resulted or results in
any changed condition of the use of adjacent land. Agricultural operations
may occur provided such activities do not violate applicable health, safety,
environmental or building codes and regulations and shall include, without
limitation:
(1) Odor from livestock, manure fertilizer or feed,
(2) Noise from livestock, or farm equipment used in normal, generally accepted
farming procedures,
(3) Dust created during plowing or cultivation practices,
(4) Use of chemicals, provided such chemicals and the method of application
conform to practices approved by the commissioner of energy and
environmental protection, or where applicable the commissioner of public
health.
§ 11-74 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 11-75
AO:145
(5) Water pollution from livestock or crop production activities, except the
pollution of public or private drinking water supplies, provided such
activities conform to acceptable management practices approved by the
commissioner of energy and environmental protection.
The provisions of this article shall not apply whenever a nuisance results
from negligence or willful or reckless misconduct in the operation of any
such agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment or facility or
any of its appurtenances.
§ 11-76. Definitions. [Ord. of 1-14-13, § III]
The terms "agriculture" and "farming" shall have all those meanings set
forth in G.S. § 1-1(q), as amended.
§ 11-77. Dispute resolution. [Ord. of 1-14-13, § IV]
Residents of Durham may seek assistance from the agricultural commission
with any complaints or concerns they have with respect to any agricultural
operation, place establishment or facility located in Durham. Residents of
Durham may seek assistance from any other Durham official, board or
commission with respect to any agricultural operation, place establishment
or facility located in Durham. The agricultural commission may provide
assistance with any complaint or concern brought to it or any other official,
board or commission. Nothing herein prohibits residents from making
complaints to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and seeking a
remedy from said department and any decision of the department of
agriculture shall be considered determinative of the issues presented to
said department of agriculture.
Nothing contained in this article shall restrict the powers of Durham's
inland wetlands commission, Planning and Zoning Commission, building or
Health Departments under Connecticut General Statutes. In addition, these
boards and departments are encouraged to adopt regulations consistent
with this article and to make the permanent preservation of farmland within
the Town, a criterion in its planning policy decisions.

Inland Wetlands and Watercourse Agency8
§ 12-61. Purpose. [Ord. of 1-9-90, § 1]
The inland wetlands and watercourses are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the
Town have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an
interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and
under-ground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and
erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the
existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland
wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of
destruction because of unregulated use by reason of deposition, filling or
removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection
of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and
eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had,
and will continue to have a significant, adverse impact on the environment
and ecology of the Town of Durham and has and will continue to imperil the
quality of the environment, thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic,
historic and recreational values and benefits of the Town for its citizens
now and forevermore. The preservation and protection of the wetlands
and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated
uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to
the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the Town. It is, therefore,
the purpose of this act to protect the citizens of the Town by making
provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the
inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and
pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the
highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing
damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other
beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction
of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of
flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses
for their conservation, economic, esthetics, recreation and other public and
private uses and values; and protecting the Town's potable fresh water
supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and
mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for
the economic growth of the Town and the use of its land with the need to
protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the
people of the Town the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and
enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
§ 12-62. Established; responsibilities. [Ord. of 1-9-90, § 2]

Numbering Buildings
§ 14-91. Purpose. [Ord. of 6-15-88, § 1]
In order to facilitate the delivery of fire prevention and ambulance services
to its townspeople, the Town adopts the following article for numbering
buildings on its streets.
§ 14-92. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the
context clearly indicates a different meaning:
CENTRAL POINT — When numbering buildings, the Town will select a
central point as close as possible to the junctions of Route 17, 77, and
79. Unless specifically covered by another rule in this article, numbers will
increase as the distance from central point increases.
EAST-WEST AXIS — The east-west axis begins at the intersection of Route
17 (Main Street) and the Middletown Town line, proceeds southerly to the
intersection of Route 17 and Route 77 (Guilford Road), then southerly on
the Guilford Road to the Guilford Town line.
NORTH-SOUTH AXIS — The north-south axis begins at the intersection
of Route 68 (Wallingford Road) and the Wallingford Town line, proceeds
easterly along Route 68 to Main Street, then southerly down Main Street to
its intersection with Higganum Road, then easterly on Higganum Road to
the Haddam Town line.
NUMBER BLOCK — A space on the Town topographical map representing
20 feet of distance on a street line.
POINT OF ORIGIN — For any street, the beginning point from which the
ROLE rule is applied when numbering buildings on the street.
ROLE RULE — An acronym for the rule that numbers will be odd if on the
right side of the street from the point of origin and even if on the left side
of the street from the point of origin. "ROLE" means right side odd and left
side even.
TERMINUS — For a through street, the two end points of the street.
THROUGH STREET — A street that runs between two other streets within
the Town or runs between Town lines.
§ 14-93. Numbering system. [Ord. of 6-15-88, § III]
(a) Use of number blocks. To assign numbers, the Town will use the 1985
topographical maps which are drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100
feet. Streets will be marked at intervals of two inches on the map,
representing 200 feet. Within the street markings numbers will be
assigned to number blocks according to the ROLE rule: for each 200
feet, five numbers on the left side, alternating odd and even every 20
§ 14-91 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 14-93
AO:201
feet. Buildings will be assigned a number based upon the number block
in which the front door of the building is situated in the space between
number blocks, it shall be assigned the lower available number.
(b) Application of the numbering system to types of streets.
(1) Streets running from north-south axis. For streets running north or
south from the axis, the point of origin will be the intersection of the
street with the axis. If the street runs north of the axis, the right or
odd side will be the easterly side of the street and the left or even
side will be the westerly side of the street. If the street runs south of
the axis, the right or odd side will be the westerly side of the street
and the left or even side will be the easterly side of the street.
(2) Streets running from east-west axis. For streets running east or
west from this axis, the point of origin will be the intersection of the
street with the axis. If the street runs west of the axis, the right or
odd side will be the northerly side of the street and the left or even
side will be the southerly side of the street. If the street runs east of
the axis, the right or odd side will be the southerly side of the street
and the left or even side of the street will be the northerly side of
the street.
(3) Through streets. Through streets that run from an axis will be
numbered as set forth in Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). Through
streets that do not connect to an axis will be numbered as if the
point of origin were the intersection with the nearer axis of a
line formed as follows: take the street's terminus that is closer
to the central point and then extend that terminus to the nearer
axis. For example, for Tri-Mountain Road as its northerly terminus
intersected with Route 68 and it were a street that ran south from
the north-south axis.
(4) Dead-end streets. For dead-end streets the point of origin will be
the intersection of the dead-end street with the through street to
which it connects. The ROLE rule would be applied by standing at
the point of origin and facing towards the end of the street.
(5) North-south axis. For those portions of the north-south axis other
than Main Street, the ROLE rule will be applied as if the point of
origin were the intersection of the axis and Main Street and the
numbers will ascend in proportion to the distance from the central
point.
(6) East-west axis. The buildings on the eastwest axis will be numbered
as if the point of origin were the central Town line or north towards
the Middletown Town line when applying the ROLE rule, and the
numbers will ascend in either direction in proportion to the distance
from the central point.
§ 14-94. Numbering types of buildings and lots. [Ord. of 6-15-88,
§ III]
(a) Duplexes, multifamily homes and condominiums. Units in a duplex will
be treated as occupying two successive odd- or even-numbered blocks
depending upon the application of the ROLE rule, for example, 12 and
14 or 11 and 13. Multifamily homes that are not duplexes will receive
§ 14-93 DURHAM CODE § 14-94
AO:202
a single number. Condominium buildings will be assigned one number,
and the units within the building will be distinguished by letters added
to the building numbers. For example, number 31A, 31B, 31C, etc.
Letter A will represent the unit closest to the central point, letter B the
unit next closest, etc.
(b) Rear building lots. For a rear building lot, the right-of-way shall be
treated as occupying a number block. The house on the rear building lot
shall bear the number assigned to the number block plus the letter R.
For example, number 128R.
(c) Outbuildings. Outbuildings will not be numbered and will be considered
as accessory to the numbered building at the site.
(d) Nonresidential buildings. A nonresidential building shall be treated as
a primary building within a number block if no numbered building lies
between the nonresidential building and the street line.
(e) Corner lots. If the front door of a building lies diagonal to the
intersection of two streets, the building will be numbered on the street
that the owner prefers. If the owner shows no preference, then the post
office will exercise its discretion in determining the street on which the
building will be numbered.
(f) Buildings previously numbered. Buildings already numbered must be
renumbered to comply with the numbering system of this article.
§ 14-95. Posting of number signs on buildings. [Ord. of
11-29-88(1)]
(a) Purpose. In order to promote the public health, safety and welfare,

following section to govern posting of number signs on buildings within
the Town.
(b) Color and height of numbers.
(1) Color. All numbers shall be of a color that contrast with the
background to which they are affixed.

maximum of 12 inches high if affixed to the following: Buildings,
fences, posts, mailboxes serving a primary building on a lot
located on the same side of the street as the building, and
mailboxes serving a primary building on a rear lot and located
within five feet of the right-of-way to the rear lot.
b. Numbers shall be no higher than 1 1/2 inches if affixed to a
mailbox across the street from the building which it serves or if
affixed to one of a group of mailboxes that serve a condominium
or other cluster of buildings on a lot.
(c) Location of numbers.
(1) Buildings visible from street line. Owners of buildings that require
street numbers and which are visible from the street line shall
affix numbers either to the top or the side of the largest building
entrance visible from the street line. The bottom of the numbers
§ 14-94 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 14-95
AO:203
shall be at least five feet above the door-step or the entrance to
which the numbers are affixed.
(2) Other buildings. Owners of buildings that require street barriers
shall affix additional numbers to fences, posts or mailboxes along
the street line. Numbers affixed to objects along the street line shall
be far enough above the ground so that they will not be covered by
fallen or piled snow during the winter months.
(d) Buildings requiring street numbers.
(1) Residential. Each single-family dwelling and each multifamily
dwelling that is not a duplex will require one set of numbers per
building. Duplexes will require separate sets of numbers for each
dwelling unit. Condominiums whose units are divided will receive
one set of numbers for each building with a separate letter added to
the number to distinguish each unit in the building.
(2) Nonresidential. The primary building on each nonresidential
property shall require a street number. The decision of the civil
preparedness director shall be final on which building within a
nonresidential property is the primary building.
(3) Outbuildings. Outbuildings or accessory buildings will not require
street numbers and will be considered accessory to the numbered
building on the property.
(e) Time for compliance.
(1) Each person who owns a building that is occupied or that has
received a certificate of occupancy at the time this article becomes
effective, and which requires a set of street numbers, must post the
street numbers within 60 days from the date either the Town or
the United States Postal Service notifies him of the numbers for the
building.
(2) Each person who owns a building that requires street numbers and
is built or receives a certificate of occupancy after the effective date
of this article must post the street number before receiving the
certificate of occupancy for the building.
(f) Penalties for noncompliance.
(1) The Town shall issue a warning notice to any building owner who
fails to post street numbers on his building within the time allowed
in Subsection (e) of this section. The warning notice shall issue from
the civil preparedness director or other official designated by the
Board of Selectmen and shall be sent certified or registered mail to
the building owner at his last known address. The warning notice
shall allow the building owner an additional 10 days from the date
of the warning notice to post the numbers.
(2) Any building owner who fails to post street numbers within the time
allowed on the warning notice shall be subject to fine of $5 a day
for each day afterwards during which he fails to post the numbers,
up to a maximum of $100 or any larger amount that the Connecticut
General Statutes permit the Town to fine for violation of this section.
(3) The Town may enforce this fine by a citation and hearing in
accordance with the provisions of Public Act 88-221.

within 10 days after such instrument is delivered to it, in which event
said organization shall be entitled to the benefits of this section from the

ARTICLE II
Senior Tax Relief Program Ordinance
§ 15-26. Purpose. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
The objective of the senior tax relief program is to "freeze" the real estate
taxes of taxpayers who qualify under this program at their current level,
subject to budgetary restrictions set forth below. This program is intended
as an alternate form of tax relief to the deferral program.
§ 15-27. Eligibility requirements; age; disability; income; residency;
participation in state programs. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
(a) The senior tax relief benefit shall be available to those taxpayers or their
spouses with respect to real property located in the Town of Durham owned
and occupied as their principal residence in Durham who are:
(1) Sixty-five years of age and over or whose spouses, living with them, are
65 years of age or over; or 60 years of age or over and the surviving
spouse of a taxpayer qualified under this plan at the time of his or her
death; or with respect to real property located in the Town of Durham
occupied as their principal residence on which such residents or their
spouses are liable for taxes under G.S. § 12-48; or
(2) Under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal
regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under social
security or who have not been engaged in thereunder but have become
qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal, state
or local government retirement or disability plan, including the Railroad
Retirement Act and any government-related teachers' retirement plan
in which requirements with respect to qualifications for such permanent
total disability benefits are comparable to such requirements under
social security.
(b) The senior tax relief benefit shall be available to taxpayers and their spouses
whose total gross income for purposes of the federal income tax, plus
any other income not included in such gross income (the total of which
shall be called "qualifying income"), does not exceed the limits as set
forth in Subsection (c) below. "Qualifying income" shall be defined as all
monies received unless specifically exempted, and includes wages, bonuses,
commissions, fees, self-employment net income, gross social security
income, payment for jury duty, dividends, interest and annuities, IRA income
to the extent that is taxable, interest or proceeds from gifts, lottery
winnings, net income from sale or rent of real or personal property,
pensions, including veterans and railroad retirement, severance pay,
unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, alimony and all other
sources of income as defined by the office of policy and management.
Specifically excluded are social security payments to dependents, gifts,
bequests or inheritances (although interest or other income produced by
gift, bequest or inheritance must be included), grants for disaster relief,
life insurance proceeds and all other exempt sources of income as defined
by the office of policy and management. Evidence of such income shall be
required, and a signed affidavit shall be submitted to the Durham Assessor
§ 15-26 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 15-27
AO:219
when application for benefits under this plan is filed. [Amended
7-28-2014]
(c) All such taxpayers or their spouses shall have been taxpayers of the Town
of Durham for not less than one year as of the first day of October prior
to the filing period. In order to make allowances for long-time citizens
in recognition of their significant contributions to our community, income
limits for eligible taxpayers will be adjusted in accordance with the
following schedule.
Income levels not to exceed:
Years of Residence Single Married
1 to 10 $32,800 $40,000
11 to 20 $50,840 $62,000
20 + $68,880 $84,000
(d) All such taxpayers or their spouses who may qualify for tax relief under
G.S. §§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and § 2-170aa, must apply for and be
included, if qualified, in such program or programs as a condition precedent
to qualifying for and receiving benefits under the senior tax relief program.
This provision shall not apply for applications concerning the October 1,
2006, Grand List for taxes due and payable on July 1, 2007.
(e) No such taxpayers or their spouses shall be eligible for any benefit under
the senior tax relief program if they are in arrears on any taxes owed the
Town, including but not limited to motor vehicle and personal property
taxes.
(f) If a qualifying taxpayer owns the property jointly with a non-spouse, tax
relief under the senior tax relief program will be proportionate to the
taxpayer's interest in the property.
(g) If property is held in trust for a person who would otherwise qualify for
the senior tax relief program, the tax relief may still be granted if the
claimant is the primary beneficiary of the trust and the claimant meets all
other requirements under this program. Under these circumstances, the
application for relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the trust agreement.
The trust agreement shall be reviewed and approved by Town counsel prior
to any relief being granted to the claimant.
§ 15-27 DURHAM CODE § 15-27
AO:220
The application for the senior tax relief program shall be a form that
has been developed and approved by the Assessor's office of the Town
of Durham. In developing the application and applying this program to
individual properties, the Assessor shall be guided by the policies
developed by the office of policy and management in administering the
state's tax relief programs set forth in G.S. § 12-129b et seq. and
§ 12-170aa. An applicant for the senior tax relief program must file a
written application for the program annually between February 1 and May
15. An applicant may file for an extension of the application deadline on or
before August 15. The request for an extension must be accompanied by
the required forms, together with a certificate signed by a physician or an
advanced practice registered nurse indicating that the applicant has been
under the care of such professional for an illness or other incapacitating
condition. [Amended 8-27-2018]
§ 15-28. Termination of relief. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
Tax relief under the senior tax relief program ends on the date that the
property is sold or transferred, or on the date of death of the qualifying
owner or qualifying spouse, whichever is earlier. If such sale, transfer or
death occurs prior to the filing period, the benefit shall be removed as
of October 1. If such sale, transfer or death occurs after the filing of an
application, the benefit shall be prorated unless there is a surviving spouse.
§ 15-29. Establishing cap and annual review. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
(a) The total amount of tax relief under the senior tax relief program to all qualified
taxpayers shall be determined by the board of finance and shall not exceed 1/
2 of 1% of the previous year's total budget, including the Town and educational
budgets.
(b) At each January meeting beginning in the year 2008, the board of finance
shall establish a maximum amount, or "cap," for the aggregate amount of
benefits available under this program. This cap shall not exceed 1/2 of 1% of
the previous year's total Town and educational budgets. The board of finance
shall review the percentage of the cap for the senior tax relief program for
the purpose of determining suitability and shall at the same time set the dollar
amount of the cap.
(c) After consultation with the Assessor, the board of finance shall determine
whether the aggregate amount of benefits sought under this program exceeds
the dollar amount of the cap. If the board of finance determines that the cap
is exceeded, it shall direct the Assessor to prorate the benefits in accordance
with provisions of this section. Excess abatement over the cap shall be prorated
over the total tax base of all participants in the senior tax relief program in
accordance with the following formula:
Total dollar amount in excess of cap/total base tax of all program participants
X individual participant's base tax = amount to be added to individual
participant's base tax amount
Note:
§ 15-27 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 15-29
AO:221
• The increase in the participant's property tax thereby increases the base
and establishes a new base tax (adjusted basis).
(1) "Base tax" shall be defined as the amount of tax levied on the property at the
time the taxpayer qualifies under the senior tax relief program.
(2) "Base year" shall be defined as the first year of qualification in the senior tax
relief program.
(3) "Excess over cap" shall be defined as the amount of tax relief that exceeds the
cap set by the board of finance.
(4) An example of the proposal would be:
Cap set by the board of finance: $300,000
Total tax of all participants: $1,000,000
Total relief to all participants: $350,000
Sample tax for participant (A) - base year: $3,000
Excess over cap ($350,000-$300,000) =
$50,000/$1,000,000 X 3,000 = $150
New basis for participant (A) = $3,150
§ 15-30. Limitation on benefits. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
The total amount of tax relief available under the senior tax relief program,
when combined with such property tax relief for which such taxpayer may
be eligible in accordance with G.S. §§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, or
§ 12-170aa, shall not exceed an aggregate of 75% of the property tax for
which such taxpayer would be liable but for the benefits under the senior
tax relief program and the state tax relief programs mentioned above in this
subsection. If the aggregate amount of such state and local benefits exceeds
said 75% of taxes otherwise due, then the amount of the benefit available
under the senior tax relief program shall be reduced so as to be equal to
the difference between the abatement afforded by such state programs and
75% of the taxes laid against the taxpayer for such real property. If benefits
received under state programs exceed said 75% of the total taxes otherwise
due, no tax benefit shall be available under the senior tax relief program.
§ 15-31. Coordination with other tax relief programs. [Ord. of
2-19-08(2)]
Taxpayers shall be eligible to participate in only one local tax relief
program, i.e., the tax deferral program or the senior tax relief program. The
benefits under either local program shall not be in lieu of benefits available
under any state tax relief program.
Taxpayers participating in the Town's existing senior and disabled tax relief
program will enter the senior tax relief program at the tax amount they
currently pay after relief. Going forward they are subject to the
requirements of the new plan.
§ 15-29 DURHAM CODE § 15-32
AO:222
§ 15-32. Interpretation to be consistent with state tax relief
programs. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
This article shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that complements
and is consistent with existing state tax relief programs. The policies and
interpretations adopted by the office of policy and management in
construing state tax relief programs shall be utilized in interpreting and
applying the provisions of this article.
§ 15-33. Right of appeal. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
Any person aggrieved by the action of the Assessor in determining the
amount of relief or in disapproving any such application under this article
may appeal to the Board of Selectmen, in writing, within 14 days after the
date of the written notification of the Assessor on such application. The
Board of Selectmen shall promptly consider such appeal and may grant or
deny the relief requested, or make such other modifications necessary to
comply with the article.
§ 15-34. Program initiation date. [Ord. of 2-19-08(2)]
This article is effective on the October 1, 2006, Grand List for taxes due and
payable on July 1, 2007.

Senior Tax Deferral Program Ordinance
§ 15-51. Purpose. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
The objective of the Durham Tax Deferral Program is to defer payment
of real estate taxes for qualifying taxpayers as described below until the
property is transferred or the claimant dies without a qualified surviving
spouse. This program is intended as an alternate form of tax relief to the
"freeze" program.
§ 15-52. Eligibility for benefits; age, disability and income
requirements. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
(a) Subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, real property tax deferral
benefits shall be available with respect to real property located in the Town
of Durham owned and occupied as their principal residence by residents of
Durham who are:
(1) Sixty-five years of age and over or whose spouses, living with them, are
65 years of age or over; or 60 years of age or over and the surviving
spouse of a taxpayer qualified under this plan at the time of his or her
death; or with respect to real property located in the Town of Durham
occupied as their principal residence on which such residents or their
spouses are liable for taxes under G.S. § 12-48; or
(2) Under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal
regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under social
security or who have not been engaged in employment covered by social
security and accordingly have not qualified for benefits thereunder but
have become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under
any federal, state or local government retirement or disability plan,
including the Railroad Retirement Act and any government-related
teachers' retirement plan in which requirements with respect to
qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are
comparable to such requirements under social security.
(b) All such residents or their spouses shall have been taxpayers of the Town of
Durham and meet income and residency requirements as stated here:
Years of Residency Requirement
5—10 years of
residency
Income not to exceed maximum income levels set
annually for single or married status, as
applicable, by the office of policy and
management for state elderly/disabled tax relief
programs
11—20 years of
residency
Income not to exceed 1.5 times the maximum
income levels set annually for single or married
status, as applicable, by the office of policy and
management for state elderly/disabled tax relief
programs
§ 15-51 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 15-52
AO:225
Years of Residency Requirement
20+ years of residency Income not to exceed 2 times the maximum
income levels set annually for single or married
status, as applicable, by the office of policy and
management for state elderly/disabled tax relief
programs
§ 15-53. Coordination with other tax relief programs. [Ord. of
2-19-08(3)]
Taxpayers shall be eligible to participate in only one local tax relief
program, i.e., the tax deferral program or the senior tax relief program. The
benefits under either local program shall not be in lieu of benefits available
under any state tax relief program.
§ 15-54. Participation in state programs required. [Ord. of
2-19-08(3)]
All such residents or spouses who may qualify for tax relief under G.S.
§§ 12-129b through 12-129d, inclusive, § 12-129h and/or § 12-170aa must
apply for and be included, if qualified, in such program or programs as
a condition precedent to qualifying for and receiving benefits under the
Durham Tax Deferral Program (DTDP).
§ 15-55. Establishing cap and annual review. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
(a) The board of finance shall establish a maximum amount, or "cap," for the
aggregate amount of deferrals available under this program. After consultation
with the Assessor, the board of finance shall determine whether the aggregate
amount of tax deferment sought under this program exceeds the dollar amount
of the cap. If the board of finance determines that the cap is exceeded, it shall
direct the Assessor to prorate the benefits in accordance with provisions of
this section. Excess requested deferral over the cap shall be prorated over all
participants in the senior tax deferral program in accordance with the following
formula:
Total dollar amount in excess of cap divided by total tax deferral amount
requested by all program participants equals the percentage the requested
deferments will be reduced.
(1) "Excess of cap" shall be defined as the amount of tax deferments requested that
exceeds the cap set by the board of finance.
(2) An example of the proposal would be:
Cap set by the board of finance: $300,000
Total requested deferred tax of all participants: $350,000
Excess of cap: $50,000
Sample tax deferral requested for participant (A): $3,000
§ 15-52 DURHAM CODE § 15-55
AO:226
Excess over cap ($350,000-$300,000) =
$50,000/$350,000 = 14.3% X $3,000 = $429. Deferral
requested $3,000 - $429 = $2,601
Amount of taxes participant (A) could defer this year =
$2,601
Amount of taxes participant (A) must pay this year =
$429
§ 15-56. Limitations on benefits. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
(a) The total amount of tax deferment allowed under the senior tax deferral
program to all qualified taxpayers shall be determined by the board of
finance and shall not exceed 1% of the proposed tax levy to which the
deferment is to be applied.
(b) For those such residents or spouses receiving or eligible to receive
benefits under the state tax relief program, the benefit available under
DTDP shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 100% of the total amount of
the tax which would, except for said G.S. §§ 12-129b through 12-129d,
inclusive, §§ 12-129h and 12-170aa and DTDP, be laid against the
taxpayer for said real property. Thus, the tax deferment available to
such residents or their spouses under DTDP shall be equal to the
difference between the abatement afforded by such state programs and
100% of the taxes (or the portion of the taxes permitted to be deferred
based on the maximum benefit cap established by the board of finance)
laid against the taxpayer for such real property. If benefits received
under state programs exceed said 100% of the total taxes due, no tax
deferment benefit shall be available under DTDP.
(c) The total amount of tax deferment allowed against any single property
under the senior tax deferral program shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, the assessed value shown on the current grand list of said
property.
(d) There shall be no tax deferment benefits available under DTDP where
income exceeds defined limits.
§ 15-57. Fractional interests or multiple-family dwellings. [Ord. of
2-19-08(3)]
The real property tax deferral relief provided under DTDP may, in any case
where title to the real property is recorded in the name of the taxpayer or
his or her spouse and any other person or persons, be prorated to reflect
the fractional share of such taxpayer or spouse, or, if such real property
is a multiple-family dwelling, such relief may be prorated to reflect the
fractional portion of such property occupied by the taxpayer.
§ 15-58. Interest, lien and repayment. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
(a) All tax deferments granted under DTDP shall bear interest from the date
said deferred taxes become due (July 1 and January 1 of each year) and
compound annually until fully paid. The rate of interest payable on such
deferred taxes shall be set annually by the Durham Board of Finance at
§ 15-55 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 15-58
AO:227
its first regular meeting in January of each year, to be applicable to the
fiscal year commencing the following July 1.
(b) As a condition precedent to receiving the tax deferral benefits under
DTDP, an applicant shall execute a tax deferral lien, on a form provided
by the Assessor, in favor of the Town of Durham at the time of
application for benefits hereunder is made, to be recorded on the
Durham land records by the Durham Tax Collector upon the approval of
such application by the Durham Assessor.
(c) Taxes deferred under DTDP shall be due and payable, together with
accumulated interest thereon, at such time as the real property in
question is sold and conveyed, whether or not for value, or title is
transferred or upon the death of such taxpayer (unless a spouse
qualified under this section hereof survives), whichever event first
occurs.
§ 15-59. Annual application process. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
(a) Any resident believing himself or herself entitled to tax deferments
under DTDP for any assessment year shall make application on a form
prepared for such purpose by the Durham Assessor and submit the
same for approval to the Durham Assessor at any time from February 1
to and including May 15 of the year for which the tax deferment benefit
is claimed. In making such application, the applicant shall present to
the Assessor, in substantiation of his or her application, a copy of
such applicant's federal income tax return including a copy of said
security statement of earnings for such applicant and that of such
applicant's spouse, if filed separately, for such applicant's taxable year
ending immediately prior to the submission of such application or, if not
required to file a return, such other evidence of qualifying income in
respect to such taxable year as may be required by the Assessor.
(b) When the Assessor is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to the tax
deferment applicable in accordance with DTDP, the Assessor shall issue
a certificate of tax deferment showing the amount of the taxes deferred
to the applicant and deliver a copy of said certificate of deferment,
together with the executed tax deferred lien, to the Durham Tax
Collector.
(c) The amount of the tax deferment approved shall be applied to the real
property tax payable by the resident taxpayer for the assessment year in
which such application is submitted and approved. If any such resident
taxpayer has qualified for a tax deferment under DTDP, the deferment
shall be applied and prorated uniformly over the number of installments
in which the real property tax is due.
§ 15-60. Right of appeal. [Ord. of 2-19-08(3)]
Any person aggrieved by the action of the Assessor in determining the
amount of relief or in disapproving any such application under this article
may appeal to the Board of Selectmen, in writing, within 14 days after the
date of the written notification of the Assessor on such application. The
Board of Selectmen shall promptly consider such appeal and may grant or

§ 16-43. Procedure for acceptance or maintenance by the Town.
[Comp. Ords. 1983, pg. 103, 12-20-82, § 3]

certification to the Board of Selectmen by all governmental authorities
having responsibility to review or approve the project, including but not
limited to the Town Engineering department, the Town Planning and
Zoning Commission and the Town inland wetlands and watercourses
agency, and including the authorized agents or employees of such
authorities, that all requirements applicable to the project served by
the facilities have been complied with, and upon compliance with all
laws applicable to the project served by the facilities, the Board of
Selectmen shall consider and, if it approves, present to a Town meeting
for approval a resolution authorizing and directing the First Selectman
to accept a deed conveying title to such facilities for control and
detention of stormwater surface runoff. If the Town meeting approves
the proposal, the First Selectman shall accept such deed, provided the
remaining provisions of this subsection are met by the grantor. Prior
to the delivery of a deed to the Town, the grantor shall pay to the
Town the sum of money per acre or fraction of an acre of land in
the project for which the stormwater runoff facility is necessary. Such
sum of money shall be determined by the Board of Selectmen upon
recommendation of the Town Engineer. This sum shall be considered
a maintenance endowment and shall be placed in the Town's general
fund. In addition to all other covenants made by the deed, the deed
shall contain a covenant and guarantee to the Town, effective for two
§ 16-41 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 16-43
AO:241
years for the recording of the deed, against defective workmanship or
materials in the improvements constructed on the property conveyed.
With the deed, the grantor shall deliver as security for the two-year
guarantee either a performance bond with the grantor as principal and
an insurance company authorized to act as a surety in Connecticut
as the surety; or a cash bond. The performance bond or cash bond
shall be certified as to form by Town counsel. The amount of the bond
shall be sufficient to cover the cost of repairing or replacing defective
materials or workmanship in the facilities conveyed, and the amount
shall also be sufficient to cover foreseeable increases in labor, material
and other construction costs for a two-year period. During the life of
the guarantee, the bond amount shall be reviewed every two years by
the Board of Selectmen and adjusted to reflect current and projected
increases in labor, material and other construction costs. Prior to the
acceptance and recording of the deed, the Town shall have no
responsibility for maintenance of the facilities. All such facilities shall be
constructed at the cost and expense of the project developer and until
accepted by the Town shall be maintained at the sole cost and expense
of the project developer. The deed or deeds to the Town shall provide
for adequate access to the facilities to be maintained and sufficient area
to carry on all necessary and convenient maintenance activities. The
deed shall be a warranty deed and shall convey to the Town title to the
property free and clear of any encumbrances, liens, claims or defects of
title which might affect ownership by the Town or its use of the property
for control or detention of stormwater or its ability to provide proper
maintenance. The grantor shall also provide an owner's title insurance
policy in the Town's name insuring the property conveyed with a title
insurer authorized to issue title insurance policies in Connecticut, in
an amount equal to the value of the land and improvements thereon
conveyed to the Town. Each deed shall be immediately recorded in the
Town land records and thereafter, the Town shall have the responsibility
for maintenance of the drainage facilities.
(b) Where the Town accepts an easement for maintenance of the facilities.
Upon written certification to the Board of Selectmen by all
governmental authorities having responsibility to review or approve the
project, including but not limited to the Town Engineering department,
the Town Planning and Zoning Commission and the Town inland
wetlands and watercourses agency, and including the authorized agents
or employees of such authorities, that all requirements applicable to
the project served by the facilities have been complied with, and upon
compliance with all laws applicable to the project served by the
facilities, the Board of Selectmen shall consider and, if it approves,
present to a Town meeting for approval a resolution authorizing and
directing the First Selectman to accept on behalf of the Town an
easement for access to and maintenance of such facilities for the control
and detention of stormwater surface runoff. If the Town meeting
approves the resolution, the First Selectman shall accept such an
easement provided all remaining conditions of this subparagraph are
met by the grantor. Prior to the delivery of the easement to the Town,
§ 16-43 DURHAM CODE § 16-43
AO:242
the grantor shall pay to the Town the sum of money per acre for each
acre or fraction of an acre in the project for which the stormwater
runoff facility is necessary. Such sum of money shall be determined by
the Board of Selectmen upon recommendation of the Town Engineer.
This sum shall be considered a maintenance endowment and shall be
placed in the Town's general fund. In addition to all other covenants
made in the easement, the easement shall contain a covenant and
guarantee to the Town, effective for two years from the recording
of the easement, against defective workmanship or materials in the
improvements constructed on the property conveyed. With the
easement, the grantor shall deliver as security for the two-year
guarantee either a performance bond with the grantor as principal and
an insurance company authorized to act as a surety in Connecticut
as the surety; or a cash bond. The performance bond or cash bond
shall be certified as to form by Town counsel. The amount of the bond
shall be sufficient to cover the cost of repairing or replacing defective
materials or workmanship in the facilities conveyed, and the amount
shall also be sufficient to cover foreseeable increases in labor, material
and other construction costs for a two-year period. During the life of
the guarantee, the bond amount shall be reviewed every two years by
the Board of Selectmen and adjusted to reflect current and projected
increases in labor, material and other construction costs. Prior to the
acceptance and recording of the easement, the Town shall have no
responsibility for maintenance of the facilities. All such facilities shall
be constructed at the cost and expense of the project developer and
until accepted by the Town shall be maintained at the sole cost and
expense of the project developer. The easement or easements to the
Town shall provide for adequate access to the facilities to be maintained
and sufficient area to carry on all necessary and convenient
maintenance activities. The easements shall be accompanied by a
Connecticut attorney's certificate of title certifying that the grantor has
fee simple title to the area covered by the easement, including access
and maintenance areas; or certifying that the grantor can lawfully grant
to the Town the right to use all areas covered by the easement including
but not limited to access and maintenance areas. Each easement shall
be immediately recorded in the Town land records, and thereafter, the
Town shall have the responsibility for maintenance of such facilities.

maximum extent practicable.
WASTEWATER — Any water or other liquid, other than uncontaminated
stormwater, discharged from a facility.
WATERCOURSE — A permanent or intermittent stream or other body of
water, either natural or man-made, which gathers or carries surface water.
This includes but is not limited to lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and any

regulations.
§ 16-83. Applicability. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 3]
This article shall apply to all water entering the storm drain system
generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly
exempted by the First Selectman or other public official or body having
jurisdiction thereof.
§ 16-84. Responsibility for administration. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 4]
The First Selectman shall, in consultation with the Town Engineer,
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. The First
Selectman may delegate his/her powers and duties under this article to an
authorized designee.
§ 16-85. Severability. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 5]
The provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable. If any
provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this article or the application
thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this
article.
§ 16-86. Ultimate responsibility. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 6]
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this article are
minimum standards; therefore this article does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
§ 16-82 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 16-87
AO:251
§ 16-87. Discharge prohibitions. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 7]
(a) Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged into the storm drainage system any materials, including
but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that
cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards,
other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
the storm drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream
flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains
(not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space
pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial
washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM
chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not
containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the First Selectman as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a written
notification to the First Selectman prior to the time of the test. Said
written notification may be in the form of electronic mail, facsimile
transmission or hard copy letter format.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit,
waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge
to the storm drain system.
(b) Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or
allows such a connection to continue.
§ 16-88. Suspension of storm drainage system access. [Ord. of
10-4-10, § 8]
Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The First
Selectman may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system
§ 16-87 DURHAM CODE § 16-88
AO:252
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent
and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the First Selectman may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the storm drainage system or waters of the United
States, or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging
to the storm drainage system in violation of this article may have their
storm drainage system access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The First Selectman will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its storm drainage system access. The violator
may petition the First Selectman for reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates storm drainage system
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the First Selectman.
§ 16-89. Industrial or construction activity discharges. [Ord. of
10-4-10, § 9]
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the First Selectman prior to the allowing of discharges to the
storm drainage system.
§ 16-90. Right of entry, evaluation, and monitoring of damages.
[Ord. of 10-4-10, § 10]
(a) Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial or construction activity, and any
other commercial or residential facilities that discharge stormwater to
the storm drainage system.
(b) Access to facilities.
(1) The First Selectman shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary
to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives or
designees of the First Selectman.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the First Selectman ready access to
all parts of the facility for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of a Town, state or federal NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
§ 16-88 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 16-90
AO:253
(3) The First Selectman shall have the right to set up on any NPDES
permitted facilities such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the First Selectman to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The First Selectman has the right to require the installation of
sampling and monitoring equipment on any NPDES permitted
facility by the discharger at its own expense. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the First
Selectman and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the First Selectman access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the First Selectman
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. If
the First Selectman has been refused access to any part of the
facility from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to
verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the First Selectman may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(7) While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in Subsections (b)(1) through (5) of this section, the First
Selectman shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the facility.
§ 16-91. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of best management practices. [Ord. of
10-4-10, § 11]
The First Selectman will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the storm drainage system or watercourses through
the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or facility, which is, or may be, the source of an
§ 16-90 DURHAM CODE § 16-91
AO:254
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the storm drainage system as directed by the
First Selectman. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
or construction activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of
a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 16-92. Watercourse protection. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 12]
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 16-93. Notification of spills. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 13]
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or water of the United States said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services (e.g., 911 or similar emergency telephone
numbers). In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the First Selectman in person or by phone, electronic mail or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the First Selectman within three business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 16-94. Enforcement. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 14]
(a) Notice of violation. Whenever the First Selectman finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she shall
order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such
notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit discharges or connections;
§ 16-91 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 16-94
AO:255
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
(5) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property are required,
the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or
restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the
violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the First
Selectman may order the work be done by a designated governmental agency
or a contractor and the violator fined an amount equal to the expense thereof,
in addition to any fines imposed in Subsection (b) or (c) of this section.
(b) Procedure for issuance of citations.
(1) The First Selectman shall issue a written notice to any person who violates
any provision of this article. No written notice may be issued against the
state or any state official or state employee acting within the scope of his
employment. Such written notice shall explain the nature of the violation
and the steps required for compliance, and shall allow a seventy-two-hour
period within which to correct the violation or within which a written plan
for correction shall be submitted to the First Selectman, setting forth a
reasonable time period for correction of the violation as agreed upon by the
First Selectman. A written notice issued pursuant to this subsection shall
be served: 1) by hand delivery, at which time the seventy-two-hour period
shall begin; or 2) by certified mail return receipt requested and by regular
first class mail. Three business days shall be allowed for mail delivery of the
notice prior to the commencement of the seventy-two-hour period.
(2) Within two business days after the period for correction established in
Subsection (a) expires, the First Selectman shall re-inspect the subject
property to determine compliance.
(3) If the violations set forth in the written notice have not been corrected at
the time of re-inspection, the First Selectman, in his/her capacity as chief
executive officer, may issue a citation and fine of up to one $100 for each
violation by hand, by certified return receipt requested, by leaving a true
and attested copy of the citation at the usual place of abode or residence
of the person in violation, or in the case of a corporate or business entity,
delivery to the business address or the address of the statutory agent of
said entity. No such fine shall be levied against the state or any state official
or state employee acting within the scope of his employment. All citations
issued pursuant to this section shall state the violation for which the citation
is being issued, the fine imposed for the violation, the time period within
which the fine must be paid, and an address for remittance of the fine.
(c) Compliance periods after citation.
(1) Any violation for which a citation is issued and which is not corrected within
the time period specified in Subsection (b) of this section shall be a new
violation of this article, and every twenty-four-hour period thereafter in
which the violation is not corrected shall constitute a new violation. The
citation shall include a notice to the alleged violator that each twenty-fourhour
period of noncompliance after the time period specified in § 16-94(b)
shall constitute a new violation and a new fine of up to $100.
§ 16-94 DURHAM CODE § 16-94
AO:256
(2) The First Selectman shall not be responsible for a daily re-inspection.
Rather, the person to whom the citation has been issued shall be responsible
for reporting subsequent compliance by way of written report to the First
Selectman. The First Selectman shall re-inspect to confirm compliance
within one business day of receipt of such report.
(d) Payment of fines.
(1) All fines imposed under this article which are uncontested shall be made
payable to the Town of Durham and shall be received by the First Selectman
within 10 calendar days from date of notice of the citation. All fines
collected by the First Selectman shall be deposited into the Town of Durham
General Fund.
§ 16-95. Appeals. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 15]
(a) If the First Selectman issues a notice of violation, the First Selectman
shall send written notice of action and a statement of the right to an
appeal to the facility operator or facility owner.
(b) The facility operator or facility owner may appeal a notice of violation to
the First Selectman by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal
within 15 calendar days after date of the notice of violation.
(c) The facility operator or facility owner may appeal the decision of the
First Selectman to the hearing officer as follows:
(1) The facility operator or facility owner may file a written request
for a review by paying an appeal fee of $25 and setting forth the
reasons for the appeal within 20 calendar days after the date of
notification of the decision from the First Selectman. Appeal fees
shall be returned to the appealing facility operator or facility owner
if the appeal is upheld.
(2) The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing within 30 calendar
days of the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be informal in
nature. The person requesting the hearing may testify concerning
the facts, circumstances and nature of his/her appeal and may
present supporting documentation. The hearing officer shall render
a written decision within 15 calendar days of the hearing. The
decision will affirm or reverse the decision of the First Selectman.
(d) Filing of a request for appeal shall stay the action by the First Selectman
requiring payment of a surcharge until the hearing officer has
completed his review. If a request for appeal is not made within the
twenty-calendar day period, the action of the First Selectman is final.
§ 16-96. Injunctive relief. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 16]
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the First Selectman may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person
from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 16-94 ADOPTING ORDINANCE § 16-97
AO:257
§ 16-97. Compensatory action. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 17]
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by
this article, the First Selectman may impose upon a violator alternative
compensatory action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, watershed cleanup, or other related activities.
§ 16-98. Violations deemed a public nuisance. [Ord. of 10-4-10,
§ 18]
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 16-99. Criminal prosecution. [Ord. of 10-4-10, § 19]
Any person that has violated or continues to violate this article shall be
liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The First
Selectman may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and
monitoring expenses.
§ 16-100. Remedies not exclusive; jurisdiction not exclusive. [Ord.
of 10-4-10, § 20]
The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the
discretion of the First Selectman to seek cumulative remedies. Compliance
with the provisions of this article shall not be construed to deprive any
other state, federal or municipal official or agency of jurisdiction over
matters within their authority or to eliminate the requirement that permits
or licenses be obtained from any relevant official or agency.
