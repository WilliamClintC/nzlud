   (D)   The City Comptroller shall have the power to determine whether

the gross billing basis (reporting, for the return period, all rentals billed
during the return period, whether collected during the return period or not).
If the owner is allowed to file his or her return on the gross billing basis,
if a billing later turns out to be a bad debt, and is charged off on the
operator’s book as a bad debt for federal income tax purposes, the owner
may take a deduction for the bad debt on his or her hotel or motel room tax
return to the city. If the owner, after taking the bad debt deduction, should

amount of the recovery when filing his or her return for the return period in
which the recovery occurs.

confidential, except for official purposes with the Accounts and Finances
Department or pursuant to official procedures for collection of any state tax
or enforcement of any civil or criminal penalty or sanction imposed by this
subchapter. Nothing contained in this subchapter shall prevent the
Comptroller from publishing or making available to the public the names and
addresses of persons filing returns under this subchapter and the number of
rooms covered in the return, or from publishing or making available
reasonable statistics concerning the operation of the tax wherein the
contents of returns are grouped into aggregates in such a way that the
information contained in any individual return shall not be disclosed. The
Comptroller may make available to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States, or a proper official of the state or a delegate of any other state
imposing a tax upon a motel or hotel room, for exclusively official purposes,
information received by the Comptroller in the administration of this
subchapter.

§ 35.078  VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation or assessment from
the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the
taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts
owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under
this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

other party in the hearing, may through the office of the City Attorney
compel the attendance of any person believed to have knowledge of any facts
relevant to a hearing under this subchapter or compel the presentation of any
tangible evidence relevant to the hearing by the issuance of a subpoena to
any person believed to have that knowledge or to have custody or control of
any relevant books, papers, records or other tangible items to be copied

personally served by the Police Department or by any other person legally
authorized to serve process as provided by state law.

vacate or modify a subpoena. The chairperson shall set a hearing on each
petition and shall give prompt notice of each petition and of the hearing
date, time and place thereof to the party who requested the issuance of the
subpoena and the petitioner. The chairperson, with the advice of the Legal
Department of the city, shall conduct each hearing. The Commission, by
majority vote, may grant the petition in whole or in part upon finding that
the testimony, or the evidence whose production is required, does not relate
to any matters in question, or that a subpoena for the production of evidence
is unreasonable and oppressive.



      (2)   Upon failure of any person to comply with the subpoena
issued as herein provided, the Human Services Coordinator may, through the
office of the City Attorney, petition any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel the attendance of the person subpoenaed and/or the production of

affirmation.

§ 38.10  DEFAULT; MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT.



   (A)   Default. The Administrative Hearing Officer may find a
respondent in default if the respondent, his attorney, or authorized
representative fails to appear at a hearing where proper service of notice of
the hearing has been provided to the respondent, in accordance with this
chapter, and where there is not a finding of good cause by the Administrative
Hearing Officer for the respondent’s absence. Upon a finding of default,
the hearing shall then proceed in absence of the respondent and evidence may
be accepted relevant to the code violation. A copy of the findings, decision,
and order resulting from the hearing shall be served on the respondent within
five days after it is issued, in a manner consistent with service authorized
in 38.06(B).



   (B)   Motion to set aside default judgment. The Administrative
Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new
hearing date, upon a petition filed by the respondent within 21 days after
the issuance of the order of default, if the Administrative Hearing Officer
determines that the respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing was for
good cause, or at any time if the respondent establishes, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that the city did not provide proper service of process. If
any judgment is set aside pursuant to this section, the Administrative
Hearing Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien
that has been recorded for any debt due and owing the city as a result of the
vacated default judgment. When a judgment is vacated, the Administrative
Hearing Officer shall proceed immediately with a new hearing on the
underlying violation(s) as soon as practical.



(Ord. 15-3507, passed 12-21-2015)



§ 38.11  JUDICIAL REVIEW.



   Any final decision by an Administrative Hearing Officer that a code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.).

sanction, or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the
failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law are a debt due and owing the city and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law. Additionally, after expiration
of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a Code violation,
unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision,
and order of the Administrative Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the
fine has not been paid within the 35-day period, the city may take any action
permitted at law to collect the outstanding fine.



   (A)   Failure to comply; costs of enforcement. In any case in which
a respondent has failed to comply with a judgment ordering that respondent to
correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result
of a code violation, any expenses incurred by the city to enforce the
judgment entered against that respondent, including, but not limited to,
attorneys’ fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or
foreclosure, repair and/or enclosure of dangerous or unsafe buildings, or
uncompleted and abandoned buildings, costs for the removal of garbage,
debris, and other hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials
from buildings or other real property after they are fixed by a court of
competent jurisdiction or an Administrative Hearing Officer shall be a debt
due and owing the city and may be collected in accordance with applicable
law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by the Administrative Hearing Officer
pursuant to this section, the city shall provide a notice to the respondent
that states the respondent shall appear at a hearing before the
Administrative Hearing Officer to determine whether the respondent has failed
to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such hearing,
which shall not be less than seven days from the date that notice is served.
If notice is served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the
date the notice was deposited in the mail.



   (B)   Lien. Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article
XII of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 12-101
et seq.), or by the Uniform Commercial Code (ILCS Ch. 810, Act 5, §§ 1-101
et seq.), a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or
both, of the respondent in the amount of any debt due and owing the city
under this code. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment
lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.



   (C)   Denial of services. If the respondent fails to pay any debt
due and owing the city as described in this section within 14 days after
service of the notice of debt, the city may take the following actions in
addition to any debt collection authorized by law:



      (1)   Decline to issue, renew, or provide any license, permit,
zoning variance, or permission applied for or requested by respondent under
any code or ordinance of the city until the respondent pays such debt.

§ 38.13  SCHEDULE OF FINES/PENALTIES AND COSTS.



   (A)   Fines and penalties shall be imposed in accordance with this
code, or where no fine or penalty is expressed in this code, the hearing
officer may impose a fine or penalty according to his judgment. However, in
no case may the fines imposed by the hearing officer exceed $1,000 per
violation per day.



   (B)   Costs. For each notice of hearing presented to the Hearing
Officer, unless the case is dismissed because a violation has not been proved

assessed in the amount of $25.

The settlement payment shall be in the amount as provided by the notice; The
notice may require that the defendant appear before the Administrative
Hearing Officer in order to prove correction of an alleged violation.



   (B)   Settlements. Settlement payments shall be made to the Finance
Department, who shall provide the alleged offender with a receipt in the
amount of such payment. As a condition precedent to the right of an offender
to settle under this section, the offender may be required to have first
corrected the violating offense (i.e. nuisance removed, appropriate
license/permit purchased, and the like).



   (C)   Disposition of payments. The amounts paid to the Finance
Department in settlement of the foregoing claims shall be promptly deposited
and will be credited to the General Fund.



   (D)   Prosecution. The city shall refrain from prosecuting any
alleged offender of the foregoing offenses after receipt of such settlement
payment as provided in § 38.14 provided the offense has been corrected. If
settlement payment is not received and the offense is not corrected pursuant
to § 38.14(A), the city may have a sworn complaint issued and prosecute the
matter by either Administrative Hearing or in the Circuit Court and the
respondent shall be responsible for the fine and court costs imposed by
either the Administrative Hearing Officer or Circuit Court Judge.

§ 51.072  HYDRANT METERS–WATER FOR CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIAL PURPOSES.



   (A)   Any person wishing to purchase water from the city to be used
in the construction of new buildings or for repairing or remodeling of
existing structures, or, for construction of any description must submit an
application therefore to the City Water Division. Upon approval of the
application, water shall be supplied to the applicant subject to the
following terms and conditions.



      (1)   All water supplied shall flow through a water meter
installed for that purpose, in accordance with the provisions of this section
governing the installation, cost of installation and removal of meters. All
water consumed shall be billed to the applicant and all water registered by
said meter shall be charged and paid for at the rate designated for hydrant
meters by the city.



      (2)   It is a violation of this section for any person to
leave a meter or backflow device (RPZ) unattended.



      (3)   No meter larger than three inches will be set for
construction purposes, and no hose or pipe of more than three inches in
diameter will be permitted or allowed to be connected to said meter. The
Water Division will determine the appropriate meter size. The applicant for
such meter shall pay the following charges/fees:



         (a)   $500.00 partially refundable deposit payable with
application;



         (b)   $25.00 meter and backflow device testing fee to be
deducted from deposit;



         (c)   $2.50 per day meter charge to be deducted from the
deposit;



         (d)   $2.50 per day per backflow (RPZ) device less than
two inch fee to be deducted from the deposit;



         (e)   $5.00 per day per backflow (RPZ) device two inches
and larger fee to be deducted from the deposit; and



         (f)   $25.00 per meter setting and removal charge by
Water Division personnel.



         (g)   In addition to the fees of this section, the
applicant shall be responsible for the full amount of any damage to the meter
and backflow device (RPZ) after it is set by Water Division personnel, in
addition to any remaining balance of said deposit, and said deposit amount
shall not limit the city in recovering the full amount of such damage. In the
case that the dial is broken or the meter fails to register the amount of
water consumed, an estimated amount of water used will be determined by the
Water Division and billed according to § 51.066 of the city  Code of
Ordinances.



         (h)   Any excess deposit remaining after payment of all
fees, costs and charges provided for herein shall be returned to the
applicant.



      (4)   As an alternative to the installation of a water meter
as set forth above, the applicant may obtain water through an existing water
meter on the subject premises; or from an adjoining property upon a showing
of written permission from the adjoining property water account holder.



      (5)   Where water cannot be obtained from any other source,
and the Water Superintendent deems that it does not interfere with proper
fire protection, a meter will be attached to one of the openings of a fire
hydrant, such supply to be controlled by a small valve on the meter
connection. In no case shall the fire hydrant valve proper be opened or
closed by anyone but a representative of the Water Division as provided in §
51.066 above.



      (6)   Where water is to be used for special purposes or where
in the judgment of the Superintendent it is not advisable to set a meter, a
special valve will be set on one of the openings of the fire hydrant for the
control of such supply. In no case shall the hydrant be opened or closed by
anyone but Water Division personnel as provided in § 51.066.



      (7)   A minimum of 24 hours notice shall be given to the Water
Division prior to the installation of a temporary hydrant meter. If such
notice is not given the Water Division will install the meter as soon as
personnel are available.



   (B)   Special Use Meters.



      (1)   Under certain circumstances a hydrant meter may be
purchased from the Water Division for users that require more frequent
temporary water service. A quarterly fee and reading of the meter will be
required. An approved backflow device (RPZ) must be purchased by the user and
tested annually at the user’s expense. The Water Division can require the
meter to be tested at any time. The person using these meters must notify the
Water Division immediately in the event problems arise accessing water from
our system. Proper hydrant operation must be used to avoid any costly repairs
to hydrants and mains.



      (2)   The Water Superintendent will determine what users would
qualify for one of these special use meters.

§ 70.033  TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.



   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals, exhibiting
different-colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used,
except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:



   (A)   Green indication.



      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may
proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place
prohibits either turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.



      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown
alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or any other
movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. The
vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.



      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal, as provided in § 70.034, pedestrians facing any green signal, except
when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.



   (B)   Steady yellow indication.



      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or
yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is
being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter.



      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in § 70.034, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall
then start to cross the roadway.



   (C)   Steady red indication.



      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk,
then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an
indication to proceed is shown.



      (2)   Except as provided in division (C)(3), vehicular traffic
facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the
movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make
a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering
the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting
the movement indicated by the red arrow is shown (see Chapter 76).



      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn,
vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the
intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a
one-way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or(2) of this
section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as
to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across
or within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent
crosswalk.



      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal
as provided in § 70.034, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red
arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.



   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the
absence of the sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

“walk” or “don’t walk” or the illuminated symbols of a walking
person or an upraised palm are in place, the signals shall indicate as
follows.



   (A)   Walk or walking person symbol. Pedestrians facing the signal
may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be
given the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.



   (B)   Don’t walk or upraised palm symbol.  No pedestrian shall
start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal, but any pedestrian
who has partly completed his or her crossing on the “walk” signal or
walking person symbol shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the
“don’t walk” signal or upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady or
flashing.

   Whenever lane-control signals are used in conjunction with official
signs, they shall have the following meanings.



   (A)   Downward-pointing green arrow. A driver facing this indication
is permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal is located.
Otherwise he or she shall obey all other traffic controls present and follow
normal safe driving practices.



   (B)   Red X symbol.  A driver facing this indication shall not
drive in the lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present.
Otherwise he or she shall obey all other traffic controls and follow normal
safe driving practices.



   (C)   Yellow X (steady). A driver facing this indication should
prepare to vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner
to avoid, if possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.



   (D)   Flashing yellow arrow.  A driver facing this indication may
use the lane only for the purpose of approaching and making a left turn.

   (A)   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used
in conjunction with a traffic-control device, it shall require obedience by
vehicular traffic as follows.



      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal).  When a red lens is
illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop
at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on
the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to
proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.



      (2)   Flashing yellow (caution signal).  When a yellow lens
is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may
proceed through the intersection or past the signal only with caution.



   (B)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be

to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic-control device
or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of

The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum
speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when
approaching and crossing an intersection, approaching and going around a
curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any narrow or
winding roadway, or when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or
other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be
decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle
on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty
of all persons to use due care.

speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall
evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding,
provided the use of the device shall apply only to the enforcement of the

DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS DOGS



§ 90.045  PROCEDURE FOR DECLARING A DOG DANGEROUS.



   (A)   An animal control officer or any adult person may request,
under oath, that a dog be classified as a dangerous dog by submitting a
sworn, written complaint on a form approved by the animal control officer
(“officer”). In addition, in any instance where the animal control
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a dog has bitten a person or a
domestic animal, an investigation as hereinafter described shall be
conducted. Upon receipt of the complaint, the officer shall notify the owner
of the dog that a complaint has been filed and that an investigation into the
allegations as set forth in the complaint will be conducted. During the
investigation:



      (1)   The custody of any dog which is the subject of the
investigation shall not be transferred by its owner to any other person; nor
shall the place of maintenance of the dog be changed from its owner’s
residence during that time, without the consent of the animal control
officer; and



      (2)   In addition, the dog may be ordered impounded by the
animal control officer if he or she has reason to believe that during the
investigation the dog will cause an immediate danger to the community if it
is not immediately impounded. The owner may appeal the impoundment order to
the Police Chief at any time by filing a written appeal with the City Police
Department. The Police Chief, or his or her designee, shall give the owner a
hearing within three business days of the filing of the appeal.



   (B)   At the conclusion of the investigation, the officer may:



      (1)   Determine that the dog is not dangerous and, if the dog
is impounded, waive any impoundment fees incurred and release the dog to its
owner; or



      (2)   Determine that the dog is dangerous and, if the dog is
impounded, release the dog to the owner after the owner has paid all fees
incurred for the impoundment. If all impoundment fees have not been paid
within ten business days after a final determination that a dog is dangerous,
the officer may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed; or



      (3)   Determine that the dog is vicious, in which case the
provisions of § 90.047 of this chapter shall apply.



   (C)   (1)   Within five business days after declaring a dog
dangerous, the officer shall notify the owner of the dog’s designation as a
dangerous dog, and of the requirements and conditions for keeping the dog, as
set forth herein. The notice shall inform the dog owner that he or she may
request, in writing, a hearing to contest the finding and designation within
five business days after delivery of the dangerous dog designation notice, by
filing the request with the animal control officer. Upon receipt of a request
for a hearing, the animal control officer shall promptly notify and deliver
the request to the hearing officer designated in § 90.045(D)(2) below.



      (2)   Within five business days after finding a dog not
dangerous, the officer shall notify the complainant of this finding. The
notice shall inform the complainant that he or she may request, in writing, a
hearing to contest the finding, by filing said request with the animal
control officer no later than five days after receiving the notice. Upon
receipt of a request for a hearing, the animal control officer shall promptly
notify and deliver the request to the hearing officer designated in §
90.045(D)(2) below.



   (D)   (1)   Upon a request for a hearing being filed as set forth
in division (C) above, a hearing shall be held in an expeditious manner, no
later than 15 days after the date the request for the hearing was received by
the animal control officer.



      (2)   The hearing shall be held before a hearing officer
appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the City Council. The
hearing officer shall not be an employee of the City of Galesburg or of the
entity which employs the animal control officer.



      (3)   The hearing officer shall provide notice of the date,
time and location of the hearing to the dog owner and to the complainant by
regular mail. At the hearing, all interested persons shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence on the issue of the dog's dangerousness.
Criteria to be considered in a hearing required by this section shall include
but not be limited to the following:



         (a)   Provocation;



         (b)   Severity of attack or injury to a person or
domestic animal;



         (c)   Previous aggressive history of the dog;



         (d)   Observable behavior of the dog;



         (e)   Site and circumstances of the incident; and



         (f)   Statements from interested parties.



   (E)   A determination at a hearing that the dog is in fact a
dangerous dog as defined herein shall subject the dog and its owner to the
provisions of this section. A determination that a dog is a vicious dog as
defined herein shall subject the dog and its owner to the provisions of §§
90.046 and 90.047 of this chapter.



   (F)   Failure of the dog owner to request a hearing shall result in
the dog being finally declared a dangerous dog and shall subject the dog and
its owner to the provisions of this section.



   (G)   The determination by the hearing officer that a dog is
dangerous or not dangerous at the conclusion of a hearing conducted under
this chapter shall be final, subject to the right to appeal the determination
to a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois law.



   (H)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any
dog which has been found to be a dangerous dog unless the person meets the
following requirements:



      (1)   Registration of dangerous dogs.  The owner shall
register a dangerous dog within ten days of the dog being declared dangerous.
The dog must be registered by April 1 of each year thereafter. The dog shall
be registered with the City Clerk. The cost of each registration shall be
$200;



      (2)   Insurance.  The owner of a dangerous dog shall present
to the City Clerk proof that he or she has procured liability insurance or a
surety bond in the amount of not less than $100,000 covering any damage or
injury that may be caused by the dangerous dog. The policy shall contain a
provision requiring that the city be notified immediately by the agent
issuing the policy in the event that the insurance policy is canceled,
terminated or expires. The liability insurance or surety bond shall be
obtained prior to the issuing of a permit to keep a dangerous dog. The dog
owner shall sign a statement attesting that he or she shall maintain and not
voluntarily cancel the liability insurance policy during a 12-month period
for which a permit is sought, unless he or she ceases to own or keep the dog
prior to the expiration date of the permit;



      (3)   Permanent identification.  Each dangerous dog shall be
injected by the animal control warden or officer with a microchip to
permanently identify the dog; and



      (4)   Transfer of ownership.  The owner of a dangerous dog
shall not transfer ownership of the animal to any other person without
providing the City Clerk and the animal control officer with the name and
address of the new owner.



   (I)   No person shall permit any dangerous dog to leave the premises
of its owner when not under control by leash or within an enclosed vehicle.



   (J)   The owner of any dog found to be dangerous shall maintain the
animal in such a manner as to prevent its coming in contact with any person
not residing with the owner.



   (K)   Any dog found to be a dangerous dog by the animal control

under oath that a dog be classified as vicious by submitting a sworn, written
complaint on a form approved by the animal control officer. Upon receipt of
the complaint, the animal control officer shall notify the owner of the dog
that a complaint has been filed and that an investigation into the
allegations as set forth in the complaint will be conducted. During the

investigation shall not be transferred by its owner to any other person; nor
shall the place of maintenance of the dog be changed from its owner’s
residence during that time, without the consent of the animal control
officer; and



      (2)   In addition, the dog may be ordered impounded by the
animal control officer if he or she has reason to believe that during the
investigation the dog will cause an immediate danger to the community if it
is not immediately impounded. The owner may appeal the impoundment order to
the Police Chief at any time. The Police Chief, or his or her designee, shall
give the owner a hearing within three business days of the filing of the
appeal.



   (B)   At the conclusion of an investigation, the animal control
officer may:

owner; or



      (2)   Determine that the dog is vicious and order that the dog
be humanely destroyed.



      (3)    Determine that the dog is dangerous, in which case the

contest the finding and designation within five business days after delivery
of the vicious dog designation notice, by filing the request with the animal
control officer no later than five days after receiving the notice. Upon
receipt of a request for a hearing, the animal control officer shall promptly
notify and deliver the request to the hearing officer designated in §
90.045(D)(2) below.



      (2)   Within five business days after finding a dog not

control officer shall promptly notify and deliver the request to the hearing
officer designated in § 90.047(D)(2) below.



   (D)   (1)   Upon a request for a hearing being filed as set forth
in division (C) above, a hearing shall be held in an expeditious manner, no
later than 15 days after the date the request for the hearing was received by
the animal control officer.

appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the City Council. The
hearing officer shall not be an employee of the city nor of the entity which
employs the animal control officer.



      (3)   The hearing officer shall provide notice of the date,
time and location of the hearing to the dog owner and to the complainant by
regular mail. At the hearing, all interested persons shall be given the
opportunity to present evidence on the issue of the dog’s viciousness.
Criteria to be considered in a hearing required by this section shall include

         (e)   Site and circumstances of the incident; and



         (f)   Statements from interested parties.

or not vicious at the conclusion of a hearing conducted under this chapter
shall be final, subject to the right to appeal the determination to a court
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois law. A determination by the
hearing officer that the dog is vicious shall include an order that the dog
be humanely destroyed.

   (B)   In addition to the redemption fee, the owner shall pay to the
animal control officer a boarding fee of $7 per day for the board of the
animal for each day or fraction of a day for which it has been impounded.

§ 90.062  ADOPTION OF DOGS OR CATS.



   (A)   All dogs or cats that are adopted from the animal shelter
shall be surgically rendered incapable of reproduction by spaying or
neutering. In addition, all animals shall be permanently identified in
accordance with the city-sanctioned registration program. A person who
desires to adopt a dog or cat prior to the surgical procedure having been
performed shall execute a written agreement stating that the person will have
the appropriate surgical procedure performed within ten calendar days from
the date of adoption. Failure to fulfill the terms of this agreement shall

officer. All fees which have been collected from the person shall be
forfeited, and the person shall not be permitted to adopt any animal from the
animal shelter again.



   (B)   Any person desiring to adopt shall pay an adoption fee to the

control officer a boarding fee of $7 per day for the board of the animal for
each day or fraction of a day for which it has been impounded.

which is six months or older shall pay a registration fee payable to the City
Clerk according to the following schedule:



      (1)   A fee of $15 if the dog/cat is altered. The fee is
waived if proof of permanent identification is presented when the dog/cat is

7-27-1981; Ord. 17-3538, passed 2-6-2017)



§ 91.071  AIRPORT-REFERENCED IMAGINARY SURFACES.



   (A)   In order to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, there
are hereby established six airport-referenced imaginary surfaces, as shown on
the map, which consist of and are described as follows.



      (1)   Datum plane. The datum plane is a horizontal plane or
surface, which includes the surface point of the airport elevation
established to be at 763 feet above mean sea level.



      (2)   Approach surfaces (noninstrument runways). The approach
surfaces are inclined planes located directly above the approach area,
extending upward and outward from its point of beginning at the near end of
the runway or landing strip, at a slope ratio of one foot vertical to 40 feet
horizontal, or at an angle of 1°25'56" from the horizontal, the approach
area being symmetrically located with respect to the extended runway or
landing strip centerline; the dimensions of the approach area are measured
horizontally as follows:



      A length of 10,000 feet beginning 200 feet from the end of the
runway or 100 feet from the end of the landing strip, and extending outward,
ending at a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway or 10,100 feet from
the end of the landing strip on the extended centerline of the runway or
landing strip; a total width of 500 feet at the end nearest to the runway or
landing strip and flared uniformly to a total width of 2,500 feet at the end
of the 10,000-foot section.



      (3)   Approach surfaces (instrument landing system runway).
The approach surfaces for all designated instrument landing system runways
are inclined planes, located directly above the approach area, extending
upward and outward from its point of beginning at the near end of the runway,
at a slope ratio of one foot vertical to 50 feet horizontal, or at an angle
of 1°08'45" from the horizontal, for the first 10,000 feet, and thence
continuing upward and outward at a slope ratio of one foot vertical to 40
feet horizontal, or at an angle of 1°23'56", from the horizontal for the
next 40,000 feet, the approach area being symmetrically located with respect
to the extended runway centerline; the dimensions of the approach area are
measured horizontal as follows:



      A length of 50,000 feet beginning 200 feet from the end of the
runway or 100 feet from the end of the landing strip, and extending outward,
ending at a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway, or 50,100 feet from
the end of the landing strip, on the extended centerline of the runway; and
having a total width of 1,000 feet at the end nearest the runway or landing
strip and flared uniformly to a total width of 16,000 feet at the end of the
50,000-foot section. The approach area requirements for instrument runway
shall apply to all runways which may be designated and used for instrument
operations and to both ends of the runways.



      (4)   Horizontal surfaces.  The horizontal surfaces are
horizontal planes, circular in shape, having a radius of 11,500 feet from the
airport reference point, at its outer limits, but excluding the approach and
transition surfaces, insofar as they are contained within the 11,500-foot
radius, and which together with the conical surface, hereinafter described,
form the upper boundary of the turning zone.



      (5)   Conical surfaces. The conical surfaces extend upward and
outward from the outer limits of the horizontal surfaces. Measuring radially
outward from the outer limits of the horizontal surfaces, the conical
surfaces extend for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet.



      (6)   Transition surfaces.  The transition surfaces are
inclined planes, symmetrically located about the centerline of the runway or
landing strip extending from the lateral boundaries of all approach surfaces
upward and outward, at a slope ratio of one foot to seven feet horizontal or
at an angle of 08°07'48" from the horizontal, to the intersection with the
horizontal surface or the conical surface, as the case may be; the transition
surfaces also extend outward and upward at the same slope ratio and angle
noted above from the edge of the landing strip, parallel with the runway or
landing strip centerline, until they intersect the horizontal surface. With
relation to a runway designated for instrument operation, the approach
surfaces projecting through and beyond the outer limits of the conical
surfaces have a transition surface extending upward and outward at a slope
ratio of one foot vertical to seven feet horizontal, or at an angle of
08°07'48" from the horizontal, for a distance of 5,000 feet measured
horizontally from the edges of the approach surfaces and at right angles to
the extended runway centerline.



   (B)   The boundaries and areas of these airport-referenced imaginary
surfaces are hereby established as shown on the map.



(1990 Code, § 5-117)  (Ord. 67-924, passed 9-18-1967)



§ 91.072  HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.



   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter no structure
or growth shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any
zone created by this subchapter to a height in excess of the height limit
herein established for the zone. The reference plane for determination and
establishment of height limits for the horizontal and conical surfaces shall
be the elevation of the datum plane as follows:



      Seven hundred sixty-three feet above mean sea level; the
reference elevation for determination and establishment of the height limits
for the approach and transition surfaces shall be the elevation (mean sea
level) of the near end of the respective runway or landing strip, as the case
may be.



   (B)   The height limit for each type zone is hereby established as
follows:



      (1)   Approach surface zones (noninstrument runways).  One
foot of height for every 40 feet in horizontal distance, measured outward
from the inner boundary of the respective approach surfaces;



      (2)   Approach surface (instrument landing system runways). 
One foot vertical to 50 feet horizontal, or at an angle of 01°08'45" from
the horizontal for the first 10,000 feet, and thence continuing upward and
outward at a slope ratio of one foot vertical to 40 feet horizontal, or at an
angle of 1°23'56" from the horizontal for the next 40,000 feet;



      (3)   Horizontal surface zones. One hundred fifty feet above
the established airport elevation;



      (4)   Conical surface zones. One foot of height for every 20
feet in horizontal distance, measured outward from the inner boundary of the
respective conical surfaces; and



      (5)   Transition surface zones.  One foot of height for every
seven feet of horizontal distance, measured outward from the inner boundary
of the respective conical surfaces.



   (C)   In addition to the requirements of divisions (A) and (B) of
this section, structures or growths shall be considered obstructions to air
navigation (unless special aeronautical study indicates otherwise) if they
are more than 500 feet aboveground or fall in the following categories:



      (1)   Objects in instrument approach areas, more than 100 feet
above the ground or 100 feet above the elevation of the approach end of the
runway, whichever gives the higher elevation of the object, within three
statute miles of the runway end, and increasing in height above ground in the
proportion of 25 feet for each additional statute mile of distance outward
from the runway end, but not to exceed 250 feet within ten statute miles of
the runway end; or



      (2)   Objects more than 170 feet above the ground or more than
170 feet above the established airport elevation, whichever gives the higher
elevation of the object, within three  statute miles of the airport
reference point, and increasing in height in the proportion of 100 feet for
each additional mile of distance from the airport, but not to exceed a
maximum of 500 feet above ground.

   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, it shall be
unlawful to put any land or body of water located within or partly within any
zone hereby created to any of the following uses:



   (A)   Any use which would create unreasonable interference with
radio communication between the airport, or communication facilities in the
vicinity thereof, and aircraft, or which would unreasonably interfere with
electronic navigational aids that may at the time of the interference be
established for the vicinity thereof, including, in the case of a runway
equipped, operated and designated as an instrument runway, any use which
would create unreasonable interference with radio communication between the
airport, or communication facilities in the vicinity thereof, and aircraft,
or which would unreasonably interfere with electronic navigational aids in
the operation and use of an instrument landing system;



   (B)   Any use which would materially reduce the visibility within
any of the aforementioned zones;



   (C)   Any use which would make it difficult for fliers in the
vicinity of or on the airport to distinguish between airport lights or
markers or other navigational lights or markers in the vicinity of the
airport, and others, or which would result in glare in the eyes of fliers
using the airport;



   (D)   Any use which would cause unreasonable interference with
navigational aids or devices used by the airport or by aircraft commonly
using the airport;



   (E)   Any business, structure, growth or occupation which by its
very nature is inherently dangerous or hazardous as respects likelihood of
causing or resulting in injury or damage to aircraft or persons using the
airport or flying in the vicinity thereof, except as provided in § 91.077; or



   (F)   Any other use or uses which would be detrimental, hazardous or
injurious to the safety of aircraft using the airport or maneuvering in the
vicinity thereof or to the health, safety or general welfare of airport
personnel and other persons using the airport, except as provided in §
91.077.

§ 91.077  PERMITS AND REPORTS.



   (A)   When permit required.  Permits shall be obtained in each of
the following instances:



      (1)   Where it is desired to increase the height of an
existing structure to a point which is less than ten feet below the height
limit within any zone hereby created; provided, the Zoning Administrator may
condition the granting of any permit on marking or lighting being installed
as he or she shall direct. The cost and expense of installation, operation
and maintenance shall be allocated between the authority and the owner as the
circumstances may require;



      (2)   Where it is desired to increase the height of any
structure which already projects upward to a point which is less than ten
feet below the height limit within any zone hereby created; provided, that in
this instance it is determined by the Zoning Administration that the
structure should be marked or lighted in the interest of safe air navigation,
the Zoning Administration may make a condition to the granting of any permit
so applied for that marking or lighting should be accomplished as it shall
direct and the cost and expense of installation, operation and maintenance
shall be allocated between the authority and the owner as the circumstances
may require; and



      (3)   Where it is desired to erect a new or additional
structure which will project upward to point which is less than ten feet
below the height limit within any zone hereby created; provided, that in that
instance it is determined by the Zoning Administration that the structure
should be marked or lighted in the interest of safe air navigation, the
Zoning Administration may make a condition to the granting of any permit so
applied for that marking or lighting shall be accomplished as it shall
direct, and the cost and expense of installation, operation and maintenance
shall be paid by the owner.



   (B)   How obtained.



      (1)   Application for the permit shall be made to the Zoning
Administration.



      (2)   Each application shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired with sufficient particularity to permit a determination
of whether the structure will conform to the regulations herein prescribed.



   (C)   Exceptions. Where an emergency installation, repair or
replacement is required to be made by any public utility company, which would
ordinarily require a permit as above set forth, but the interest of the
public from the standpoint of health, safety or general welfare does not
permit sufficient time to obtain the permit, then in that event the
requirement shall not apply, but a report shall be given as set forth in this
section.



   (D)   Reports.



      (1)   In zones other than horizontal surface zone.  Whenever
a new structure is erected or the height of an existing structure is
increased in any of the zones hereby created except the horizontal surface
zone, and the proposed height of the structure does not require a permit as
above set forth, a written report shall be given to the Zoning Administration
within ten days after the completion of the alteration or erection, setting
forth the facts relating thereto with sufficient particularity to permit a
determination as to whether the structure conforms to the regulations
prescribed herein.



      (2)   In horizontal surface zone.  Whenever a new structure
is erected or the height of an existing structure is increased in the
horizontal surface zone so as to cause the structure to project more than 40
feet above elevation of airport elevation, and the proposed height of the
structure does not require a permit as above set forth, a written report
shall be given to the Zoning Administration within ten days after the
completion of the alteration or erection, setting forth the facts relating
thereto with sufficient particularity to permit a determination as to whether
the structure conforms to the regulations prescribed herein.



   (E)   Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administration determines that a nonconforming structure or growth has been
abandoned or more than 80% has been torn down, physically deteriorated or
decayed:



      (1)   No permit shall be granted that would allow the
structure or growth to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise
deviate from the zoning regulations; and



      (2)   The Zoning Administration may by appropriate action
compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or growth, at his or her own
expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct or equip the object as may be
necessary to conform to the regulations, or, if the owner of the
nonconforming structure or growth shall neglect or refuse to comply with such
an order after ten-days’ notice thereof, the Zoning Administration may
proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped,
and shall obtain a lien upon behalf of Galesburg Municipal Airport upon the
land whereon it is or was located, and in the amount of the costs and expense
thereof. The lien may be enforced by the authority by suit in equity for the
enforcement thereof, as in the case of other liens.



   (F)   Issuance. Except as provided herein, all applications for
permits for replacement, change or repair of nonconforming uses shall be
granted.



   (G)   Variances.  Any person desiring to erect or increase the
heights of any structure or permit a growth, or use his or her property not
in accordance with the regulation prescribed in this subchapter may apply to
the Board of Appeals for a variance from the regulations. The variance shall
be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement
of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest
and safety, but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the
spirit of this subchapter; provided, that any variance may be allowed subject
to any reasonable conditions that the Board of Appeals may deem necessary to
effectuate the purposes of this subchapter.



   (H)   Hazard marking and lighting.  Any permit or variance granted
may, if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
subchapter and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or growth to install, operate and maintain
thereon any markers and lights as may be necessary in the interest of safe
air navigation, as shall be determined by the Zoning Administration, to
indicate to flyers the presence of any airport hazard; the cost and expense
of installation, operation and maintenance shall be paid by the owner.

required by the Fire Prevention Code Official and shall be connected to a
water system in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The Fire
Prevention Code Official shall designate and approve the number and location
of fire hydrants. The Fire Prevention Code Official may require the
installation of sufficient fire hose and equipment housed in accordance with

§ 94.09  PRAIRIE PLOT.



   (A)   Declaration.  Planting, cultivating and maintaining any
prairie plot in violation of the provisions of this section is hereby
declared to be a nuisance.



   (B)   Nuisance prohibited.  Any owner, agent, occupant, responsible
party or person shall have the duty to maintain prairie plots in compliance
with this section.



   (C)   Permit required.  The city recognizes the desirability of
permitting and encouraging managed prairie plots within the city limits while
maintaining public health and safety. Any owner, agent, occupant, responsible
party or person who intends to plant, cultivate and maintain an existing
prairie plot, a new prairie plot, or add plants to or increase the area of a
previously approved prairie plot shall make application to the Department of
Planning and Public Works on a form supplied by the Department, and provide a
site plan drawn to scale or dimensioned on sheets of paper no smaller than
eight and one-half by 11 inches and no larger than 24 by 36 inches which
contains the location of property lines, location of the proposed prairie
plot, list of native plants and seeds to be planted (common names), north
arrow, location of structures and paved areas, type of landscape border to be
used to define the edges and distances of defined edge to property lines.
City staff will review the application and site plan. If the application
materials comply with the provisions of this section, the application and
site plan will be placed on the next available City Council agenda.
Applications for prairie plots in existence at the time Ordinance 06-3143 is
adopted may be brought before the City Council for review prior to full
compliance with the provisions of this section.



   (D)   Permit fee.  The fee for a prairie plot permit shall be $10
and shall be paid upon application for the permit. The fee is nonrefundable
regardless of the decision by City Council to approve or deny the prairie
plot permit.



   (E)   Denial of permit.  If, after due consideration of the
information in the application, the City Council determines that the plan is
unsatisfactory, the application will be denied and a permit will not be
issued. A notice of denial will be sent to the applicant by regular mail
within 15 days.



   (F)   Compliance with permitted plan.  If, at any time, the
implementation of a permitted plan exceeds that planting shown on the plan or
if other weeds, plants or grasses are allowed to grow to a height exceeding
that allowed by § 94.03, it shall be and is hereby deemed a nuisance and the
permit shall be revoked. A notice of violation will be sent in accordance
with division (M) of this section.



   (G)   Residential. Residentially used or zoned property shall comply
with the requirements as specified below.



      (1)   Prairie plots may only be located in a rear yard.  A
rear yard is determined and defined as set forth in the zoning ordinance of
the city.



      (2)   Prairie plots shall only cover up to 10% of a rear yard.
If prairie plots are intermingled with other vegetation so as to make it
impractical to measure for determining if the percentage is more or less than
10% of the rear yard, the entire bed or area of mixed vegetation shall be
deemed to be a prairie plot for the purpose of the calculation.



   (H)   Defined edges.  All prairie plots shall have borders that
define the limits of the prairie plot. Borders shall include but are not
limited to railroad ties, landscape timbers, landscape blocks, concrete
edgers or metallic strips sunk into the ground. Trenching is not an allowable
alternative. Prairie plots on commercial properties may be allowed to use a
mowed lawn as a border, if approved by the City Council. If a prairie plot is
burned in accordance with division (J) below, landscape timbers and railroad
ties are not recommended borders.



   (I)   Setback.  All prairie plots shall have a mandatory setback of
five feet from any property line to the defined edge of the prairie plot.



   (J)   Prairie plot burns.  Prairie plots may be burned under the
following mandatory procedures and conditions to ensure complete safety and
control of the burning.



      (1)   Burning of a prairie plot is optional and up to the
owner as to whether he or she chooses to burn his or her plot in any
particular year.



      (2)   A permit shall be required from the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency and the City Fire Department prior to each
time a prairie plot is burned. The City Fire Department shall issue a prairie
plot burn permit, if a permit is available, and the permit fee, as indicated
in § 93.18, shall be payable at time of application. No more than five
prairie plot burn permits will be issued in the city in any calendar year.



      (3)   Burning shall be done between February 1 and April 15.
No fall burning is allowed.



      (4)   The burning of a prairie plot shall not be used for the
burning of tree leaves, branches, logs or other garden refuse. A violation of
this section shall result in the immediate cancellation of any valid prairie
plot permit. The minimum fine to be imposed upon conviction of a violation of
this division (J)(4) shall be as set forth in § 94.99.



      (5)   The City Fire Department shall be contacted to schedule
a day and time for the burn so fire personnel and their equipment are present
during the burn.



      (6)   Burning shall not be attempted on windy days. A wind
velocity of at least five miles per hour is needed to conduct a burn, which
may aid in a cleaner and more thorough burn.



      (7)   A thorough burn is best accomplished starting after noon
when the morning dew has dissipated. No burning is allowed after dark.



      (8)   All old growth of the previous season shall be chopped
down to near ground level before burning.



      (9)   An adequate length of garden hose, in good condition,
shall be laid out to reach the entire perimeter of the plot.



      (10)   A perimeter area of two to three feet wide around the
plot shall be thoroughly wet down, including all surfaces of any border
structures.



      (11)   The plot shall be burned off starting the fire on the
down-wind side of the plot.



      (12)   After the fire is well started, the up-wind side may be
fired to complete a thorough burn.



      (13)   If, during the burn, smoke or ash is proving to be a
nuisance to a neighboring yard, the fire must be immediately extinguished.



      (14)   In prairie plots that are bordered by railroad ties or
landscape timbers, the structures shall be thoroughly wet down before
starting the burn. Railroad ties shall not be allowed to burn and are not
recommended as borders.



   (K)   Annual cutting and removing of plant debris.  It shall be a
requirement of this section and a condition of the permit that each year, the
prairie plot shall be mowed or cut to near ground level and the resulting
plant debris be removed from the site sometime during the dormant season and
prior to May 1. If a prairie plot is burned in accordance with division (J)
above, the ash from burning should be left on the site as a ground warming
process that stimulates prairie growth and reduces weed competition.



   (L)   Plant lists. The city recognizes the following sources as
authoritative references concerning prairie plants. The Illinois Natural
History Survey at the University of Illinois maintains a database listing of
plants native to Illinois prairies. The Source Book on Natural Landscaping
for Public Officials published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
includes a limited list of plants native to Illinois prairies commonly
available in nurseries that are relatively easy to grow. The Illinois State
Museum maintains a list of prairie plants found in Illinois prairies. Any
owner, agent, occupant, responsible party or person proposing prairie plots
involving plant species not recognized by the above organizations will be
required to provide plans prepared by a landscape architect, horticulturist
or similar qualified professional to show the proposed species are native to
Illinois prairies.



   (M)   Notice. If a prairie plot exists that is in violation of this
section, the Department shall serve a violation notice either personally or
by regular mail to the name and address of the tax bill owner listed on the
City Assessor’s records. A notice shall be deemed to have commenced to run
from the date the notice is mailed. A notice shall be deemed sufficient
although the person to which it is directed refused delivery of the same or
if it is not deliverable.



      (1)   The text of the notice shall contain the date; a
reference to the provision of this section violated and a brief description
of the violation; the address or description of the property sufficient for
identification thereof; and a statement that if the violation is not abated
within five days the city will provide for the abatement; and the cost or
expenses related to the abatement, lien filing and foreclosure of lien shall
be charged to the person.



      (2)   Only one violation notice shall be required to be sent
per property during any one calendar year. In the event subsequent violations
are observed during the same calendar year, the Department may proceed as set
forth in division (K) above, without further notice.



   (N)   Abatement by city.  Upon refusal or neglect to comply with
the violation notice within five days of its mailing or delivery, the
Department shall have the power to enter upon the premises, or to authorize
its agent to do so, and abate the violation. The Department may grant a
one-time five-day extension per calendar year to the compliance deadline
established in the violation notice if requested by the responsible party.



   (O)   Statement of cost.  The actual costs of abatement, costs of
processing the bill, mailing or serving documents, recording documents and
any other incidental expenses shall be billed to the tax bill owner listed on
the City Assessor’s records. A statement for the costs shall be served
either personally or by regular mail and must include:



      (1)   A reference to the ordinance violated;



      (2)   A description of the property where the violation
occurred sufficient for identification thereof and general location of the
violation that was abated;



      (3)   The amount of money representing the cost and expense
incurred or payable for the service;



      (4)   The date or dates when the cost or expenses were
incurred by the city or one acting under its direction or control; and



      (5)   An explanation that if the bill is not paid in full
within 15 days, a late fee will be added to the bill and the city will
prepare and file a lien.



   (P)   Lien. If the costs are not paid within 15 days of the mailing
of the statement, the Department shall proceed to perfect and enforce a lien
upon the real estate affected, as provided in § 11-20-7 of the Illinois
Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-20-7) as now in force and hereafter
amended. A notice of lien filed shall be served either personally or by
certified mail to the tax bill owner listed on the City Assessor’s records
informing them a lien has been filed.



   (Q)   Release of lien.  Upon payment of the cost or expenses and
lien release fee by the tax bill owner, agent or responsible party or person
interested in the property, the lien shall be released by the Department,
which shall cause the release to be filed of record.



   (R)   Foreclosure.  If the costs or expenses for weed abatement has
remained unpaid for two years after it has been incurred, the Department may
proceed to foreclose the lien in like manner and with like effect as provided
by the state statutes in foreclosure of mortgages or mechanic’s lien. The
costs of foreclosure incurred by the municipality, including court costs,
reasonable attorney’s fees, advances to preserve the property, and other
costs related to the enforcement of this division, plus statutory interest,
are a lien on the real estate and are recoverable by the municipality from
the owner or owners of the real estate.



   (S)   Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not be
applicable to any premises or lands containing a prairie plot maintained by
the United States of America, this state, or any unit of local government,
primary school, secondary school or college.

by the vehicle owner and the city and make a finding as to the lawful
authority of the tow based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented.
The city shall make a showing of probable cause to establish the validity of
the tow in accordance with city ordinances. The burden of proof shall be on
the vehicle owner to show that the tow was invalid and unauthorized under the

ordinance authorizing the tow. The owner may be entitled to total or partial
reimbursement for towing and storage fees, if any. The specific amount due
the owner shall be stated in the decision. Reimbursement in the event of an
unauthorized tow shall be made to the owner by the city. The owner shall be

within 30 days of the mailing of notice of towing or the date the vehicle was
released from the towing company, whichever was earlier.

hearing was requested, but the person requesting the hearing failed to appear
or failed to properly request a continuance.



   (F)   All vehicle tow hearing decisions, towing reports and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the city for a
period of at least three years after each hearing, or after each tow if no
hearing was requested or held.



   (G)   Notwithstanding any other ordinance to the contrary, any
towing service operator authorized to perform tows on behalf of the Police
Department must perform its services subject to the provisions of this
subchapter.



   (H)   The hearing shall be conducted according to rules and
regulations promulgated by the city and shall determine the validity of the
impoundment or tow of the vehicle. If the hearing officer sustains the
validity of the tow, the owner or person entitled to possession will be
required to pay all unpaid towing and storage fees before obtaining the
release of the vehicle. If the hearing officer determines the tow to be
unauthorized, the towing operator shall be paid by the owner for towing and
storage charges prior to release of the motor vehicle, and the vehicle owner
shall be entitled to prompt reimbursement by the city.

the excavation work to its original condition and/or in accordance with the
specifications of the City Engineer and any other applicable regulation, code
or ordinance. The permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over
openings made in paved traffic lanes. Except when the pavement is to be
replaced before the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom
of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material well tamped into
place, and this fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least two inches of
crushed rock which is suitable to maintain the opening in good condition
until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary
restoration shall not exceed one inch above the adjoining pavement. The
permittee shall exercise special care in making the temporary restorations
and must maintain the restorations in safe traveling condition until such

purpose of restoring the same to its original condition, as nearly as
possible. Any permanent restoration shall be made so that brick shall be
replaced with materials meeting the requirements of the current city
statement of policy regarding brick streets in the city on file in the office
of the City Clerk, concrete shall be replaced with concrete, bituminous
concrete shall be replaced with bituminous concrete, and oiled earth shall be
replaced with oiled earth or bituminous concrete.



   (C)   All work shall be done in a workmanlike manner, and concrete
shall be treated and allowed to cure in accordance with accepted good
practice and a “crushed stone concrete” shall be used in all cases where
concrete is specified. All bituminous concrete shall be placed on the exact
same type base as was originally in place, or a substitute deemed
satisfactory by the engineer, and shall be rolled with a pneumatic-tired
roller or steel roller as directed by the engineer. Oiled earth shall have a
satisfactory granular base comparable to the original, or one deemed
satisfactory by the Engineer and shall be primed and sealed in a manner
directed by the Engineer.



   (D)   Acceptance or approval of any excavation work shall not
prevent the city from asserting a claim against the permittee for incomplete
or defective work if discovered within 24 months from the completion of the
excavation work. The City Engineer’s presence during the completion of any
excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities
hereunder.

      (2)   Application process. The city shall process applications
as follows:



         (a)   The first completed application shall have
priority over applications received by different applicants for collocation
on the same utility pole or wireless support structure.



         (b)   1.   An application to collocate a small
wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure,
or replacement of an existing utility pole or wireless support structure
shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved
if the city fails to approve or deny the application within 90 days after the
submission of a completed application.



            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall
notify the city in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved
remedy no sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application.



            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the
latter of the 90th day after submission of the complete application or the
tenth day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. The
receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of
the permit request within the time limits as provided under this subchapter.



         (c)   1.   An application to collocate a small
wireless facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall

with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall
notify the city in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved
remedy no sooner than 105 days after the submission of a completed
application.



            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the
latter of the 120th day after submission of the complete application or the
tenth day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. The
receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of
the permit request within the time limits as provided under this subchapter.



         (d)   1.   The city shall deny an application which
does not meet the requirements of this subchapter.



            2.   If the city determines that applicable codes,
ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation
requirements and conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or
wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation,
approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or
wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. The city shall
document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or
application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant on or before the day the city denies an
application.



            3.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies
identified by the city and resubmit the revised application once within 30
days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an
additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the revised
application within 30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or
it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30
days of denial shall require the application to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the city's review period.



            4.   The applicant must notify the city in writing
of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved
basis, which may be submitted with the revised application.



            5.   Any review of a revised application shall be

on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the
applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment
Agreement.



      (3)   Completeness of application. Within 30 days after
receiving an application, the city shall determine whether the application is
complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the city
must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be
deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant
within 30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the city's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the city. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city
sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the
missing information.



      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further
tolled by:



         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant
and the city; or



         (b)   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or
similar emergency that causes the delay.

reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan
or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.



      (7)   Alternate placements.



         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be
required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole,
or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna
systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for
the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility
pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on
an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100
feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has
the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions,
and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or
additional material costs as determined by the applicant.



         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by
the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate
location does not satisfy the criteria in this division.



      (8)   Height limitations.

            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing
utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities,
that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that
is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or
wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such
facility; or



            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.



      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes
a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height
limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation,
the applicant shall apply for an administrative waiver from the Director of
Planning and Public Works. Such application shall be submitted in writing
along with plans for the pole and other such materials requested by the
Director of Planning and Public Works. In determining whether to grant an
administrative waiver, the Director of Planning and Public Works shall
consider the standards for variances outlined in Chapter 152 of this code.

comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility
poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.



      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which
a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the
permit, unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period
or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by
the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the
issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after
issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city
grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

   (A)   Grounds.  Pursuant to the procedures set forth in division
(B) of this section, the official may revoke or suspend any junk yard license
if the official, based on credible and reasonably reliable information and
evidence, determines that any one or more of the following has occurred:



      (1)   The licensee has violated any of the provisions or
requirements of this subchapter or the junk yard license issued pursuant to
this subchapter;



      (2)   The licensee either knowingly or negligently furnished
false or misleading information or withheld information on any application or
other document submitted to the city for the issuance or renewal of any junk
yard license; or knowingly or negligently caused any other person to furnish
or withhold that information on the licensee’s behalf;



      (3)   The licensee has committed a felony on the licensed
premises;



      (4)   The licensee authorizes, approves or, as a result of the
licensee’s negligent failure to supervise the junk yard, allows, a junk

requirements of this subchapter or of the provisions or requirements of the
junk yard license issued pursuant hereto, or commit any felony on the
licensed premises; or



      (5)   The licensee, or any person identified pursuant to §

written notice shall, at a minimum, state that the official has determined
that the junk yard license may be subject to suspension or revocation
pursuant to division (A) of this section; identify the specific grounds for
the official’s determination; and set a date for a hearing regarding the
official’s determination as to the possibility of suspension or revocation
of the junk yard license. The date of the hearing shall be no less than five
days after service of the official’s notice, unless an earlier or later
date is agreed to by the licensee and the official.



      (2)   Hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the official.
At the hearing, the licensee may present and submit evidence and witnesses to
refute the grounds cited by the official for suspending or revoking the
license, and the city and any other persons may submit evidence to sustain
those grounds. The administrative record compiled on the junk yard pursuant
to § 110.095 shall be made part of the hearing record. Within three days
after the close of the hearing, the official shall, having considered the
record made at the hearing, render a decision in writing, setting forth the
reasons for the decision. The action taken by the official to suspend or
revoke the license shall be final and shall be subject to review pursuant to

et seq.



      (3)   Notice and effective date of suspension or revocation.
The official’s written decision shall be posted at the office of the
official and shall be served on the licensee in person or by certified U.S.
mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the

      (4)   Surrender of license. Upon the suspension or revocation
of a junk yard license pursuant to this subchapter, the official shall take
custody of the suspended or revoked license.

and opportunity for an administrative hearing to present evidence and have
the decision reviewed.

review the renewal application for any updates that require further
investigation and shall issue a renewal unless such renewal application
identifies information prohibiting the issuance of a license pursuant to the
municipal code or other reasons provided in this chapter. Upon denial of any
renewal, the local liquor control commissioner shall provide a written notice
to the applicant stating the reasons for denial and opportunity for an
administrative hearing to present evidence and have the decision reviewed.



   (C)   Administrative hearing. Upon any denial of issuance or renewal
of the license or denial of a proposed change of premises, the licensee may
request an administrative hearing before the local liquor control
commissioner to review such decision. Such hearing is a prerequisite to
review by the State Liquor Commission. The hearing shall be open, and all
interested parties shall have the right to speak and present evidence
supporting or contesting the denial. After hearing all evidence, the local
liquor control commissioner shall issue a final written order affirming the
denial, reversing the denial or reversing the denial with conditions imposed

   (B)   Reviewing department reports.  Each of the reviewing
departments shall, within 25 days after transmittal of the application
thereto, or within any other period of time as the city and the applicant may
otherwise agree:



      (1)   Review the application;



      (2)   Conduct inspections of the proposed licensed premises
and background investigations of the applicant and any of the individuals
identified in the application pursuant to § 114.16(C)(1), (2) or (13),
regarding matters within their respective jurisdictions, as shall be
reasonably necessary to verify the information set forth in the application

licensed premises comply with the requirements of this chapter and other
applicable laws, codes, articles, rules and regulations; and

licensed premises to be inspected; to appear at any reasonable time and place
for examination under oath regarding the application; or to otherwise
cooperate with the investigation and inspection required by this chapter,

deny the license within the 30-day period or any other period of time as
shall have been agreed to by the city and the applicant, regardless of
whether or not the Adult Use Commissioner has received all of the reviewing
department reports.



   (G)   Decision final.  The action taken by the Adult Use
Commissioner to issue or deny an adult establishment license pursuant,

violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be the act or
omission of the licensee if the act or omission occurs either with the
authorization, knowledge or approval of the licensee, or as a result of the
licensee’s negligent failure to supervise the adult establishment employee.
The licensee shall be punishable for the act or omission in the same manner
as if the licensee committed the act or caused the omission. Accordingly, the

      (2)   The licensee either knowingly or negligently furnished
false or misleading information or withheld information on any application or
other document submitted to the city for the issuance or renewal of any adult
establishment license, or knowingly or negligently caused or suffered any
other person to furnish or withhold the information on the licensee’s
behalf;



      (3)   The licensee has committed a felony or specified
criminal act on the licensed premises;



      (4)   The licensee authorizes, approves or, as a result of the

adult entertainment establishment, allows an adult establishment employee, an
adult establishment patron or any other person to violate any of the
provisions or requirements of this chapter or of the provisions or
requirements of the adult establishment license issued pursuant hereto; or
commit any felony or specified criminal act on the licensed premises; or



      (5)   The licensee, or any person identified pursuant to §
114.16(C)(1), (2) or (13) of this chapter becomes disqualified for the
issuance of an adult establishment license at any time during the term of the
license at issue.



   (B)   Procedure.  An adult entertainment establishment license may
be suspended for not more than 30 days or revoked pursuant to the terms and
conditions set forth in this division (B).



      (1)   Notice.  Upon determining that one or more of the
grounds for suspension or revocation under division (A) of this section may
exist, the Adult Use Commissioner shall serve a written notice on the
licensee in person or by certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, addressed to the licensee’s address as set forth in the
licensee’s application. The written notice shall, at a minimum, state that
the Adult Use Commissioner has determined that the adult establishment
license may be subject to suspension or revocation pursuant to division (A)
of this section; identify the specific grounds for the Adult Use
Commissioner’s determination; and set a date for a hearing regarding the
Adult Use Commissioner’s determination as to the possibility of suspension
or revocation of the adult establishment license. The date of the hearing
shall be no less than five days after service of the Adult Use
Commissioner’s notice, unless an earlier or later date is agreed to by the
licensee and the Adult Use Commissioner.



      (2)   Hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by the Adult Use
Commissioner. At the hearing, the licensee may present and submit evidence
and witnesses to refute the grounds cited by the Adult Use Commissioner for
suspending or revoking the license and the city and any other persons may
submit evidence to sustain those grounds. The administrative record compiled
on the adult entertainment establishment pursuant to § 114.40 shall be made
part of the hearing record. Within three days after the close of the hearing,
the Adult Use Commissioner shall, having considered the record made at the
hearing, render a decision in writing, setting forth the reasons for the
decision. The action taken by the Adult Use Commissioner shall be final and
shall be subject to judicial review.



      (3)   Notice and effective date of suspension or revocation.
The Adult Use Commissioner’s written decision shall be posted at the office
of the Adult Use Commissioner and shall be served on the licensee in person
or by certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,

seventeenth day after the Adult Use Commissioner’s written decision is
placed in the U.S. mail as provided in this division (B)(3).



      (4)   Surrender of license and security.  Upon the suspension
or revocation of an adult establishment license pursuant to this chapter, the
Adult Use Commissioner shall take custody of the suspended or revoked
license; and that part or all of the bond or other security submitted for the
adult entertainment establishment pursuant to § 114.16(B)(2) shall be
forfeited as the Adult Use Commissioner shall deem necessary to reimburse the
city for the costs associated with the proceedings related to the suspension
or revocation at issue. The bond or other security shall be replenished to
equal the amount required pursuant to § 114.16(B)(2) prior to the issuance
of any new adult establishment license for the licensed premises or for the
reinstatement of any suspended license.

§ 150.002  GENERAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION.



   (A)   Purpose.  A general contractor registration program is
established to:



      (1)   Promote, protect and provide for the health, safety and
financial welfare of the community in general, as it is affected by the
construction industry; and



      (2)   Assure that any person, group, firm, partnership or
corporation who engages in activities covered by these requirements can meet
the necessary criteria set forth herein in order to become a registered
general contractor.



(1990 Code, § 6-514)

to perform any work specified above, and who are not considered employees of
the general contractor shall also be considered a general contractor and
shall also be registered. To be considered an employee, the persons,
partnership or corporations must be paid directly by the general contractor
and covered under the general contractor’s liability, workers’
compensation and unemployment insurance as required by applicable state
statutes.



      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(3) below, before

before any general contractor now engaged in that business shall continue in
that business, the general contractor shall be required to register with the
city.



      (3)   An owner of a building shall be permitted to obtain
permits for general contractor work performed by the owner on that building,
without being required to register as a contractor.



      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a
person who performs general contractor work to his or her employer’s
property to be a registered general contractor, where there exists an
employer-employee relationship.



(1990 Code, § 6-515)

registration application affirming himself or herself as a sole proprietor.



      (2)   Any person, partnership or corporation desiring to
become a registered contractor shall first pay a registration fee of $75.

or hold himself or herself out as engaging in general contractor business
under the registration unless and until the registration is renewed.



      (6)   It shall be the responsibility of the registered general

in writing on forms provided by the Board and presented to the Inspector. The
application shall be accompanied by satisfactory affidavits that the
applicant has had at least six years of practical experience installing and
altering electrical equipment, four years of which must be at a level
comparable to the journeyman classification; or that the applicant has
successfully completed an approved course of instruction in electrical
contracting from a college, university or trade school. The Board shall
review the application and determine if the applicant is eligible for a
license. Any information found to be misrepresented in the application shall
be cause for revocation of a license. The Board shall prescribe uniform and
reasonable rules defining what constitutes an approved course of instruction
in electrical contracting from a college, university or trade school, and
approve or disapprove the courses of instruction offered by the college,
university or trade school by reference to their compliance or noncompliance
with the rules. The rules shall be designed to assure that an approved course
of instruction will adequately teach the design, planning, installation,

   (A)   Before an electrical contractor’s license shall be issued,
the applicant shall, following reasonable advance notice, present himself or
herself for examination before the Board at a time and place set by them. The
Board shall examine the applicant as to his or her practical knowledge of the
installation and alteration of electrical equipment, and his or her knowledge
of the rules and regulations for the installation of electrical wiring
devices and equipment. This examination shall consist of two written parts.
The first part shall be closed book and consist of questions which test the
individual’s knowledge of general wiring principles. The second part shall
be open book and consist of questions which test the applicant’s ability to
use the formulas and tables found in the Electrical Code. The applicant must
score a minimum of 70% to pass. If the applicant fails the test the first
time, there shall be a 30-day waiting period from the test date before it can
be retaken. Should the applicant fail the second test or each test
thereafter, there shall be a six-month waiting period from the date of the
last test before being retested.

nonrefundable examination fee. The fee shall be paid each time the test is
taken.



   (C)   An electrical contractor who is licensed with another city
shall not be required to be tested, provided the other community utilizes the
National Electrical Code, and a test comparable to the city’s examination
has been passed in the other city. In this case, the contractor must submit a
copy of his or her license along with the proper bond and insurance as
provided for in this subchapter. The registration fee shall be waived,
provided the electrical contractor has paid a registration fee in the other
community of at least the amount required by the city. If the registration
fee paid is lower than the city’s fee, the difference between the two shall

than 30 business days to correct the violations. The report shall state a

landlord’s failure to receive a copy of the report does not limit the
city’s right to enforce these requirements.



   (B)   After re-inspection(s), if the Inspector believes the landlord
or his/her agent is not correcting the violations or allowing re-inspections,
either by refusal or missed appointments, the Inspector may refer the
violation(s) to the city’s administrative adjudication process.



   (C)   If the Inspector determines that the violation poses a

      (1)   Will not adversely affect the significant historical or
architectural character of the historic preservation district as defined in

§ 151.070  DENIAL FOR IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN HISTORIC PRESERVATION DISTRICTS.



   (A)   If the Landmark Commission finds the activity proposed by the
applicant as not meeting any of the requirements in § 151.069(C), the
Landmark Commission shall disapprove the application and so advise the
applicant and Building Inspector in writing of the denial.



   (B)   Following the denial of the certificate of appropriateness by
the Landmark Commission, the Commission secretary shall transmit to the owner
a letter within five working days, stating the changes requested by the
Landmark Commission before the certificate of appropriateness will be issued.
The letter will address itself to the appropriate criteria and other points

writing to the Commission and the Commission is satisfied that the criteria
in § 151.069(C) will be met, it shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness; if not, the certificate of appropriateness shall be denied

§ 151.071  DEMOLITION OR REMOVAL OF A LANDMARK OR STRUCTURE WITHIN AN
HISTORIC PRESERVATION DISTRICT.



   (A)   Procedure.  The Commission secretary shall notify the
Commission of any application for a certificate of appropriateness involving
the demolition, partial demolition or removal of a structure or significant
accessory structure. The Commission shall schedule a public hearing within 21
days of the receipt of the application for a certificate of appropriateness
with proper notification through the newspaper and shall notify the applicant
in writing. At the hearing, the Commission shall request the following
information:



      (1)   A report from the Building Inspector on the state of
repair and structural stability of the structure under consideration;



      (2)   Information and graphics on the extent and process of
demolition or removal, including information on any proposed changes in
landscaping;



      (3)   Evidence of any hardship that would result in
substantial economic loss to the applicant from denial of the petition; and



      (4)   An assessment of any alterations in the essential
character of the area which would occur as a result of demolition or removal
action.



   (B)   Decision of Commission.  If the Commission’s decision is to
postpone the demolition or removal, the Commission shall notify the owner in
writing. During the period set forth for postponement of the requested
action, the Commission shall explore alternatives to demolition or removal.
These alternatives may include consultation with private civic groups,
interested private citizens and other public boards or agencies in an effort
to find a persuasive means of preserving the structure. If sale of property
is considered a feasible alternative to the owner, the building must remain
on the open market, dependent on its classification, for the following
lengths of time:



      (1)   Historically and architecturally significant, six
months; and



      (2)   Noncompatible, no waiting period.



   (C)   Failure to reach agreement.  If, after a period not to exceed
six months, no alternative agreement has been reached with the applicant, the
Commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or
removal of the structure in question.

   In granting the certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall
recommend conditions necessary to minimize the adverse impact of the
requested activity as outlined in § 151.065.



(1990 Code, § 12-138)  (Ord. 79-671, passed 5-4-1979)



§ 151.073  APPEALS.



   (A)   Where the Commission has denied issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness, the applicant for the certificate may appeal to the City
Council. The appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 15 days after
the decision of the Commission. The City Council shall hold a public hearing
and shall vote on the appeal within 45 days of its receipt.



   (B)   A simple majority vote of the City Council in opposition to
the denial must be recorded in order for a denial by the Landmark Commission
to be overturned.



   (C)   A simple majority vote of the City Council in support of the
denial must be recorded in order for a denial by the Landmark Commission to
stand. The City Council shall transmit its decision in writing to the
Building Inspector and the applicant.



(1990 Code, § 12-139)  (Ord. 79-671, passed 5-4-1979)

allowed by the Council. At its discretion, the City Council may waive fees
for internal projects.



      (3)   Application.  Applications for amendments to the

(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-2.3, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 12-3343, passed 1-23-2012;
Ord. 17-3538, passed 2-6-2017)



§ 152.018  SPECIAL USES, SPECIAL USE PERMITS.



   (A)   Purpose.  The development and execution of this chapter is
based upon the division of the city into districts, within any one of which
the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or
structures as related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized,
however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique
character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or
districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses
upon the neighboring lands and upon public need for the particular use or the
particular location.



   (B)   Authorization.  The Planning and Zoning Commission is
authorized to grant special use permits and to hear and decide upon
applications for special use permits listed in the district regulations of
this chapter. Before authorizing the issuance of a special use permit, the
Commission may impose any conditions that will, in the Commission’s
judgment, ensure:



      (1)   The proposed amendment is consistent with the intent of
the Comprehensive Plan;



      (2)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the
special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort or general welfare;



      (3)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyments of adjacent properties for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;



      (4)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;



      (5)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other
necessary facilities will be provided; and



      (6)   Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion on the public streets.



   (C)   Transference.  A special use permit shall not be transferred
to another location; nor shall a special use permit be conveyed to another
use at the same location. A new special use permit shall be required for
either of these two changes.



   (D)   Time limitations.  The following time limitations shall apply
to special use permits:



      (1)   In cases where the use authorized by a special use
permit requires a building permit, the applicant shall have three months from
the date the special use permit is granted to apply for a building permit. If
application has not been made within that time, the special use permit shall
expire and become null and void;



      (2)   In cases where a building permit is not required, any
construction or activity authorized or required pursuant to the special use
permit must commence within three months from the date the special use is
granted. In the event the construction or activity is not commenced within
the three-month period, the special use permit shall expire and become null
and void; and



      (3)   Any other time restrictions as detailed in the
conditions placed on the special use.



   (E)   Application for special use.



      (1)   Who may file.  Special use applications may be
initiated by all the fee owners of the subject property, by the owners’
authorized agent, or by any person, business or organization requesting or
intending to request an occupancy certificate.



      (2)   Fees.  Before any action shall be taken as provided in
this section, the party or parties proposing the special use shall pay fees
established by ordinance (see Fee Schedule). Under no condition shall the sum
or any part thereof be refunded for failure of the request to be allowed by
the Council.



      (3)   Application.  Applications for a special use shall be
accompanied by 15 sets of the proposed site plan (see § 152.134 for plan
requirements). In addition, any other information as shall be established
from time to time by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be submitted to
the Director of Planning and Public Work or his or her designee. No
application for a special use shall be acted upon by the Planning and Zoning
Commission until after:



         (a)   Copies of the application and all supporting
materials are distributed to and reviewed by the Development Review
Committee. The Development Review Committee shall submit written comments to
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant prior to the public
hearing.



         (b)   A public hearing has been held by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, which is required, by state statute. Notice of the
public  hearing shall be published in the local newspaper not less than 15
days prior to the public hearing.



            1.   Not less than ten days prior to the date of
the public hearing, the Building Inspector shall post a readable sign(s) on
the premises. Sign(s) must be removed no later than ten days after a
recommendation is made by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The sign(s)
shall be visible from the roadway.



            2.   With each decision, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall prepare a Findings of Fact based on evidence presented to it.

   (F)   Decisions by Planning and Zoning Commission.  All decisions
of the Planning and Zoning Commission on special use permit applications
arrived at after the hearing shall require a majority vote of all members
present.



   (G)   Appeal of Planning and Zoning Commission decision to City
Council. An applicant for a special use may appeal to Planning and Zoning
Commission’s action to the City Council. The procedure for making an appeal
is as follows:



      (1)   A written notice of appeal must be filed with the
Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee within 15 days
from the date of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action.



      (2)   The appeal shall be considered by the City Council at
its next regularly scheduled meeting occurring not less than five days
following the filing of the notice of appeal. The City Council may, in its
discretion, uphold, overturn or amend the action taken by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.



      (3)   If the applicant fails to submit the written notice of
appeal within the 15-day appeal period, the Planning and Zoning
Commission’s decision shall be final.

Ord. 17-3538, passed 2-6-2017)



§ 152.019  VARIANCE.



   (A)   Purpose.  The “variance” process is intended to provide
limited relief from the requirements of this chapter in those cases where
strict application of those requirements will create a practical difficulty
or particular hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise
allowed under this chapter. It is not intended that variances be granted
merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of
this chapter may impose on property owners in general. Rather, it is intended
to provide relief where the requirements of this chapter render the land
difficult to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property
itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is
requested. In no event, however, shall the city grant a variance which would
allow the establishment of a use which is not otherwise allowed in a zoning
district or which would change the zoning district classification of any or
all of the affected property.



   (B)   Authorized variances.  Variances from the regulations of this
chapter may be decided by the Planning and Zoning Commission only in
accordance with the standards set forth in this division (B):



      (1)   To permit a setback less than the setback required by
the applicable regulations, the reduction shall not exceed 30%;



      (2)   To permit the use of a lot of record on the effective
date hereof for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient
area of the lot;



      (3)   To reduce by not more than 30% the required lot width;



      (4)   To permit the same off-street parking spaces to qualify
as required spaces for two or more uses; provided that the maximum use of the
facility by each user does not take place during the same hours;



      (5)   To increase by not more than 25% the maximum distance
that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served;



      (6)   To reduce the off-street parking requirements
established in §§ 152.150 through 152.155 by a maximum of 50% of the
requirement, provided it can be shown why the established requirement is not
applicable or appropriate;



      (7)   Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee, in the
enforcement of this chapter;



      (8)   To vary fence regulations where the variance will
benefit the applicant and will not be detrimental to the public health or
safety or to the use, enjoyment or value of the property in the near vicinity;



      (9)   To vary the outdoor lighting regulations as detailed in
§ 152.032; and



      (10)   To vary other provisions of this chapter.



   (C)   Standards for granting variances. 



      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not vary the
provisions of this chapter as authorized in this section unless it shall have
made affirmative findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each of
the following specific cases:



         (a)   That the property in question cannot yield a
reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed
by the regulations governing the district in which it is located. Applicants
must submit evidence identifying the price paid for the property. Paying more
for the property than it is worth, purchasing it at a price which anticipates
and obtains variances, or showing that the property would be worth more if a
variance is granted is not evidence of lack of a reasonable return;



         (b)   That the situation of the owner is due to unique
physical circumstances of the property; and



         (c)   That the variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood.



      (2)   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards,
the Planning and Zoning Commission, in making this determination whenever
there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, shall also take
into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the
applicant, have been established by the evidence:



         (a)   That the particular physical surroundings, shape
or topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a
particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out;



         (b)   That the conditions upon which the petition for
variance is based would not be applicable generally to other property within
the same zoning classification;



         (c)   That the purpose of the variance is not based
exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property;



         (d)   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not
been created by any person presently having an interest in the property;



         (e)   That the granting of the variance will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and



         (f)   That the proposed variance will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase
the danger of fire, otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.



      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may require
conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may
be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this division (C) to
reduce or minimize the injurious effect of the variance upon other property
in the neighborhood, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this
chapter.



   (D)   Time limitations.  The following time limitations shall apply
to variances issued by the Commission.



      (1)   In cases where the use authorized by a variance requires
a building variance, the applicant shall have three months from the date the
variance is granted to apply for a building variance. If application has not
been made within that time, the variance shall expire and become null and
void.



      (2)   In cases where a building permit is not required, any
construction or activity authorized or required pursuant to the variance must
commence within three months from the date the variance is granted. In the
event the construction or activity is either not commenced within the
three-month period, the variance shall expire and become null and void.



      (3)   Any other time restrictions as detailed in the
conditions placed on the variance.



   (E)   Application for variance, notice of hearing.



      (1)   Who may file.  Variance applications may be made by any
property owner or his or her agent.



      (2)   Fees.  Before any action shall be taken as provided in
this section, the party or parties proposing the variance shall pay fees
established by ordinance (see Fee Schedule). Under no condition shall the sum
or any part thereof be refunded for failure of the request to be allowed by
the Council. At their discretion, the City Council may waive fees for
internal projects.



      (3)   Application.  Applications for a variance shall be
accompanied by 15 sets of the proposed site plan (see § 152.134 for plan
requirements). In addition, any other information as shall be established
from time to time by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be submitted to
the Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee.

      (4)   Prerequisites.  No application for a variance shall be
acted upon by the Planning and Zoning Commission until after:



         (a)   Copies of the application and all supporting
materials are distributed to and reviewed by the Development Review
Committee. The Development Review Committee shall submit written comments to
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant prior to the public
hearing.



         (b)   A public hearing has been held by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, which is required by state statute. Notice of the public
hearing shall be published in the local newspaper not less than 15 days prior
to the public hearing.



            1.   Not less than ten days prior to the date of
the public hearing, the Building Inspector shall post a readable sign(s) on
the premises. Sign(s) must be removed no later than ten days after a
recommendation is made by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The sign(s)
must be visible from the roadway.



            2.   With each decision, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall prepare a Findings of Fact based on evidence presented to it.



   (F)   Decisions by Planning and Zoning Commission.  All decisions
of the Planning and Zoning Commission on variances, shall require a majority
vote of all members.



   (G)   Appeals of Planning and Zoning Commission decision to City
Council. An applicant for a variance may appeal the Planning and Zoning
Commission’s action to the City Council. The procedure for making an appeal
is as follows:



      (1)   A written notice of appeal must be filed with the
Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee within 15 days
from the date of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action.



      (2)   The appeal shall be considered by the City Council at

§ 152.020  NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Purpose and scope. 



      (1)   This chapter establishes separate districts, each of
which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted
in that district. The purpose of this section is to provide for the
regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses, and to specify
those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings,
structures and uses shall be permitted to continue.



      (2)   The provisions of this section are designed to curtail
substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about their eventual
improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this chapter
and enhance the character of the city. Any nonconforming use, structure or
lot which lawfully existed as of July 6, 2010 and any use, structure or lot
which has become nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this chapter or
any subsequent reclassification of zoning districts or other amendment to
this chapter, may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the
terms of this section.



      (3)   This section is intended to regulate and limit the
development and continued existence of uses, structures and lots established
prior to the effective date of this chapter which do not conform to the
requirements herein.



      (4)   For the purpose of this section, a building or structure
lawfully constructed or established on the effective date hereof, shall be
deemed to include any building or structure for which a building permit has
been lawfully issued prior to that date, and on which construction is begun
within the required period of time as set forth in this chapter.



   (B)   Continuance of nonconforming building, structure or use.  Any
nonconforming building, structure or use which existed lawfully at the time
of adoption of this chapter and which remains nonconforming upon the adoption
of this chapter, or of any subsequent amendments thereto, is subject to the
regulations which follow.



   (C)   Expansion of nonconforming use.  The nonconforming use of a
part of a building or structure may be expanded within the building or
structure in which the use is presently located, but no changes or structural
alterations shall be made unless the changes or structural alterations
conforms to all the regulations of the district in which the building or
structure is located.



   (D)   Change of nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use shall not
be changed to another nonconforming use, except where the proposed use is
located in the same or a more restrictive zoning district than where the
existing nonconforming use is first allowed and an application for the change
has been submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
application shall follow the application filing procedures for a variance
request as outlined in § 152.019.



   (E)   Intermittent use.  The casual, intermittent, temporary or
illegal use of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the
existence of a nonconforming use. The existence of a nonconforming use on a
part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming
use on the entire lot or tract.



   (F)   Discontinuance or abandonment of nonconforming structure or
use.



      (1)   Whenever any part of a structure or land occupied by a
nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the
provisions of this chapter, the premises shall not thereafter be used or
occupied by any nonconforming use, even though the structure may have been
originally designed and constructed for the prior nonconforming use.



      (2)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure, or part
thereof, has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, or
whenever it is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a
nonconforming use, the use shall not after being discontinued be
reestablished, and the use of the premises thereafter shall conform with the
use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.



   (G)   Repairs and alterations of nonconforming structures.



      (1)   Repairs may be made to a nonconforming structure,
provided that no structural alterations shall be made in or to a structure,
all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not
permitted in the district in which it is located. However, structural
alterations may be made if they are required by law or are necessary to make
the structure and use thereof conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located.



      (2)   No structural alterations shall be made in a building or
other structure containing a nonconforming use, except in the following
situations:



         (a)   When the alteration will result in eliminating the
nonconforming use; and



         (b)   A structure containing a residential nonconforming
use may be altered or enlarged, provided that the enlargement or alteration
itself conforms to the requirements of the zoning district, and provided no
structural alteration shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units The enlargement cannot exceed 25% of the existing building.



   (H)   Additions or expansions of nonconforming structures.



      (1)   A building and/or structure which is nonconforming as to
lot size requirements or building bulk regulations shall not be added to,
expanded or enlarged unless the addition, expansion or enlargement conforms
to all the regulations of the district in which it is located.



      (2)   A structure which is nonconforming with respect to
yards, lot coverage or any other element of bulk regulated herein shall not
be altered or expanded in any manner which would increase the degree or
extent of its nonconformity with respect to the bulk regulations of the
district in which it is located.



      (3)   A nonconforming building or structure which is
nonconforming only as to bulk shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner
unless the additions and enlargements thereto are made to conform to all
regulations of the district in which it is located.



   (I)   Restoration of a damaged nonconforming structure.



      (1)   A nonconforming structure which is destroyed or damaged
by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of
restoration shall exceed 50% of the value based on the County Assessor’s
records for the entire structure shall not be restored unless the structure
and use conforms to the provisions of the zoning district in which it is
located.



      (2)   If the cost of restoration of the damaged structure does
not exceed 50% of the value based on the County Assessor’s records for the
entire structure, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless the
restoration is commenced within six months from the date of the fire or other
casualty or act of God, and is diligently pursued until completion. The
structure may be restored to its original condition and the occupancy or use
of the structure may be continued which existed at the time of the partial
destruction. Failure to initiate or conclude restoration within these limits

§ 152.032  OUTDOOR LIGHTING.



   (A)   Statement of purpose. The city does herein find that
regulation of outdoor lighting in the city is necessary to prevent
misdirected or excessive artificial light, caused by inappropriate or
mishandled light fixtures that produce glare, light penetration and/or
unnecessary sky glow; and to improve or maintain nighttime public safety,
utility and security.



   (B)   General requirements.  All outdoor light (greater than 3,000
initial lumens) fixtures installed and thereafter maintained on commercial,
industrial or multi-family developments adjacent to or across the
right-of-way from residentially used or zoned property, other than street
lighting and those serving one- or two-family dwellings, shall comply with
the requirements as specified below.



      (1)   Lighting shall be designed to minimize impact on
adjacent residential property.



      (2)   All fixtures with output greater than 14,000 (for
example, anything larger than a 175 watt high discharge lamp) initial lumens
shall be fully shielded with no lenses or globes protruding below the shell
of the fixture. Fixtures shall generally be parallel with the ground and
shall be installed with non-adjustable mounting hardware, but may have up to
a ten-degree angle if facing away from a public right-of-way or a residential
property.



   Figure 152.032: Lighting Fixture Design







      (3)   Externally illuminated building identification or other
signs shall only use shielded light fixtures mounted on top of the sign
structure.



      (4)   The use of searchlights is prohibited, other than a
period of seven days from the opening of a new establishment.



      (5)   Exemption: airport lighting and sports lighting by the
city, schools or other public agencies shall be exempt from these general
requirements.



      (6)   All outdoor lighting fixtures, including display
lighting, but excluding signs, shall be turned off after close-of-business,
unless needed for safety or security, in which case the lighting shall be
reduced to a minimum level necessary. Lighting of signs is addressed in §§
152.180 through 152.191, 152.205 through 152.220 and 152.230 through 152.233.



   (C)   Light penetration.  All outdoor lighting fixtures installed
and thereafter maintained on commercial, industrial or multi-family
developments adjacent to or across the right-of-way from residentially used
or zoned property, other than street lighting and those serving one- or
two-family dwellings, shall be designed, installed and maintained to prevent
light penetration. At the property line, penetration from light fixtures
shall not exceed one footcandle measured on the ground.



   (D)   Variance.  Applicants may apply for a variance from these
outdoor lighting regulations as detailed in § 152.019.



   (E)   Plan submission requirements.  The following information
shall be submitted with a request for a building permit or an electrical
permit for new construction or remodeling, or when an outdoor light fixture
is replaced with a different fixture:



      (1)   Description and location of outdoor light fixtures
including component specifications such as lamps, reflectors, optics, angle
of cutoff, supports, poles and include manufacturer’s catalog cuts; and



      (2)   The footcandle level at the property line measured at
ten-foot intervals and on a ten-foot grid throughout the lighted area for
outdoor display areas or under a canopy.



   (F)   Measurements.  Measurement of light levels shall be
accomplished as follows.



      (1)   Metering equipment.  Lighting levels shall be measured
in footcandles with a direct-reading, portable light meter. The meter shall
read within an accuracy of plus or minus 5%. It shall have been tested,
calibrated and certified by an independent commercial photographic laboratory
or the manufacturer.



      (2)   Method of measurement.  The meter sensor shall be
mounted not more than six inches above ground level in a horizontal position
at the property line. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed long enough to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be
taken in locations free of shadows.



   (G)   Light levels.  Light levels for various lighting applications
shall be appropriate for the given application. In addition, the following
standards shall apply:



      (1)   Outdoor display lots. All display lot lighting,
including auto dealerships or other outdoor sales areas, shall utilize fully
shielded luminaries that are installed in a fashion that maintains the fully
shielded characteristics. The light level used for illuminating outdoor
displays shall not exceed 30 footcandles; and



      (2)   Service station/gas pump canopies.  All luminaries
mounted on or recessed into the lower surface of service station canopies
shall be fully shielded and utilize flat lenses. The light level used for
illuminating service station canopies shall not exceed 40 footcandles in the
B1, B2, B3, M1, M2 or CPD Districts and shall not exceed 20 footcandles in
all other districts.



   (H)   Grandfathering of nonconforming luminaires.  Luminaires in
place prior to June 17, 2002 shall be exempt from these regulations. The
exempt luminaires may be replaced with a similar kind of luminaire unless
more than 50% of the similar luminaries on the same premises are being
replaced. In this case all the replacement luminaries on the premises shall
meet the standards of this chapter.



   (I)   Administration.  The Planning and Public Works Department is
hereby empowered and directed to administer and enforce the provisions of
this section relating to outdoor light control for commercial, industrial and
multi-family development as well as public buildings.

final, development plan for a commercial or industrial use shall provide for
a solid brick or other approved decorative masonry wall or solid wood, vinyl
or other approved material fence along the property line(s) located adjacent
to the R district. The wall or fence shall be a minimum six feet in height,
excluding the area within the required front yard setback. The wall or fence
shall be continued within the required front yard at a height of four feet.



      (2)   Corner lots which have rear yards abutting each other
may have fences less than seven feet high erected on that part of the lot
which is at least as far back from the front of the lot as the principal
building. Corner lots which have rear yards abutting each other need have
only one front yard, which shall be in the front of the principal building.
(Figure 152.033(F) illustrates the requirements of this division.)



   Figure 152.033(F)(2): Fences in Corner Lots







      (3)   Corner lots which have rear yards abutting the side yard
of an adjacent lot may have fences less than seven feet high erected on that
part of the corner lot which is at least as far back from the street fronting
the lot as the front building line, provided that one of the following
additional requirements is met:



         (a)   The fence shall cut off at a 90-degree angle for a
distance at least equal to the minimum front lot requirement for the district
at that point on the rear lot line of the corner lot which intersects with
the front building line of the adjacent lot, after which distance the fence
may cut back at an angle of at least 90 degrees to the side lot line of the
corner lot (see Figure 152.033(F)(3)(a)); or



   Figure 152.033(F)(3)(a): Fence with 90-Degree Cut-off







         (b)   The fence shall cut off at a minimum of a
45-degree angle from that point on the rear lot line of the corner lot which
intersects with the front building line of the adjacent lot, to the side lot
line of the corner lot. (See Figure 152.033(F)(3)(b) in next column.)



      (4)   Fences shall be installed so as not to interfere or
impede the flow of surface drainage.

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the district map, the following rules shall apply.



   (A)   The district boundaries are either centerlines of streets or
alleys unless otherwise shown, and where the districts designated on the
district map, being made a part of this chapter, are bounded approximately by
street or alley lines, the street or alley shall be construed to be the
boundary of the district.



   (B)   Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and
where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots,
the district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines, and where the
districts designated on the district map are bounded approximately by lot
lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts
unless the boundaries are otherwise indicated on the map.



   (C)   In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the
map shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.

§ 152.051  PERMISSIBLE USES AND SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS.



   (A)   The presumption established by this subchapter is that all
legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one zoning district
in the city’s planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because uses listed in this
subchapter cannot be all-inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be
interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the
listed uses.



   (B)   Notwithstanding division (A) above, all uses that are not
listed in this subchapter, even given the liberal interpretation mandated by
division (A) above, are prohibited. Nor shall the listed uses in this
subchapter be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use
in question is more closely related to another specified use that is
permissible in other zoning districts.



   (C)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions,
the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts:



      (1)   Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale,
distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in
violation of the city’s Fire Prevention Code; and



      (2)   Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in
which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services
are performed, or other business is conducted. (Situations that do not comply
with this division on the effective date of this chapter are required to
conform within 30 days.)

a site plan showing the location of the proposed building on the site. Either

require a public hearing as set forth in § 152.017. This plan shall comply
with the following.



      (1)   All lighting shall be designed and located so as to
confine direct rays to the premises and away from adjoining residential uses.
The lighting shall be allowed only between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00

compatibility between adjacent uses of varying types and intensities.



         (b)   The proposed structure should relate favorably to
the landscape, the neighborhood and follow the overall architectural
character of the community. For example, office buildings adjacent to
single-family homes with pitched roofs should have a similar roof style
rather than the typical commercial flat roof.



         (c)   The size of the proposed structure should relate
well to adjacent structures and its surroundings.

§ 152.080  CPD - COMPREHENSIVE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of a comprehensive planned development
is to permit diversification in the type and location of structures in
accordance with sound planning concepts and to better serve the public
interest by introducing flexibility into zoning regulations. This section
applies to the Comprehensive Planned Development District. In the
Comprehensive Planned Development District the uses set out in division (D)
of this section are permitted after approval. A Comprehensive Planned
Development District shall mean a development of one or more tracts of land
involving a combination of land uses and containing at least 20 acres of
land. Comprehensive planned developments are of a substantially different
character that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby
set out.



   (B)   General procedure. 



      (1)   Each Comprehensive Planned Development District shall be
developed pursuant to a general plan of site development for the
Comprehensive Planned Development District (hereinafter called “the
plan”). The plan shall be designed so that the Comprehensive Planned
Development District to be developed pursuant thereto shall afford space for
appropriate commercial, residential and/or community facilities.



      (2)   The procedure for establishing an area as a
Comprehensive Planned Development District shall be the same as for the
establishment of zoning districts under this chapter; that is, by amendment
to this DO. Said procedure only applies to the intitial rezoning of the
parcel to the CPD classification.



      (3)   The applicant proposing the Comprehensive Planned
Development District shall submit to the city 15 copies of the plan when the
application for the district amendment is made. The plan shall be prepared by
an architect, or an engineer, duly registered to practice in this state, or a
municipal planner, landscape architect or other who is qualified in the
opinion of the city.



      (4)   At the time of plan submittal, the applicant proposing
the comprehensive planned development must pay applicable fees (see Fee
Schedule, Appendix A).



      (5)   A notice that the plan is on file at the City Clerk’s
office shall be recorded with the County Recorder regardless of whether a
subdivision is proposed and the plan shall show building lines, common land,
streets, easements and other applicable features. The plan may be modified or
revised at any time prior to final action by the City Council adopting the
amendment establishing the area as a Comprehensive Planned Development
District, and no additional public hearing on the application for the
amendment shall be required even though the  revisions or modifications are
made after the initial public hearing unless the City Council directs that an
additional public hearing be held.



      (6)   The Comprehensive Planned Development Districts may be
developed in stages. When the development is by stages, the plan of stage one
shall be prepared along with a preliminary plan of the balance of the total
district designating the type of use in each area, such as commercial,
residential and community facilities. Before any subsequent stage is
developed, the plan of that stage shall be prepared and submitted to the
city. A public hearing shall be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and its recommendations, along with the plan, shall be submitted to the City
Council.



      (7)   Once an area has been established by the City Council as
a comprehensive planned development a specific site plan is required for each
lot that is developed within the district. The site plan shall be prepared in
accordance with the requirements listed in §§ 152.130 through 152.137. When
an application for site plan review is made to the Planning and Public Works
Department, the Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee
shall schedule a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission. A
legal notice shall be published in the newspaper not less than 15 days before
the public hearing date giving notice of the proposed site plan. In addition,
a sign shall be posted on the subject premises not less than ten days in
advance of the public hearing date giving notice of the proposed site plan.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold the public hearing and make a
recommendation to the City Council regarding the site plan. After receiving a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council
shall consider the site plan and act to approve, approve with modifications
or deny the site plan.



   (C)   Annexation agreement.  In lieu of the procedures provided in
division (B) above upon the filing of an annexation petition, the city may
approve an area for a Comprehensive Planned Development District based upon a
general plan of development, generally locating the areas to be developed for
specified uses with the restrictions and modifications provided for in an
annexation agreement as the city deems necessary in order to better serve the
public interest. The approval of an area for a Comprehensive Planned
Development District shall be binding upon the city and the applicant;
provided, however, that prior to the issuance of any building permits, all
codes or ordinances of the city then in effect or as modified by the terms of
the annexation agreement shall be complied with.



   (D)   Permissive uses.  Permissive uses of land or buildings, as
hereinafter listed, shall be permitted in the Comprehensive Planned
Development District as approved under the site plan process. No building or
land within the Comprehensive Planned Development District shall be devoted
to any use other than uses permitted hereunder.

§ 152.099  REVOCATION OF TOWER USE PERMITS.



   Any tower use permit issued pursuant to this subchapter may be revoked
after a hearing as provided hereinafter. If the Director of Planning and
Public Works or his or her designee finds that any permit holder has violated
any provision of this subchapter, or has failed to make good-faith reasonable
efforts to provide or seek collocation, the Director of Planning and Public
Works or his or her designee shall notify the permit holder in writing that
the TUP is revocable due to the permit holder’s noncompliance with the
conditions of the permit. The Director of Planning and Public Works or his or
her designee may require the permit holder to correct the violation within a
reasonable amount of time or the Director of Planning and Public Works or his
or her designee may recommend to the City Council that the tower use permit
be revoked. After the appropriate public hearing, the Mayor and City Council
may revoke the tower use permit (TUP) upon any terms and conditions, if any,
that the Mayor and City Council may determine. Prior to initiation of
revocation proceedings, the Director of Planning and Public Works or his or
her designee shall notify the permit holder, in writing, of the specific
areas of noncompliance and specify the date by which the deficiencies must be
corrected. The time for correction of deficiencies shall not exceed 60 days.
The permit holder shall provide the Director of Planning and Public Works or
his or her designee with evidence that the required corrective action has
been taken. Should the permit holder fail to correct any deficiencies in the
time required, the Mayor and City Council shall convene a public hearing to
consider revocation of the tower use permit. The hearing shall be conducted
pursuant to notice by publication in a newspaper with general circulation in
the city not less than ten days prior to the hearing and by written notice to
the permit holder. At the hearing, the permit holder may be represented by an
attorney and may cross-examine opposing witnesses. Other interested persons
may comment. The Mayor and City Council may impose reasonable restrictions
with respect to time and procedure. The proceedings shall be recorded;
provided, however, that stenographic services, if desired, shall be provided
by the requesting party at that party’s expense.

      (2)   A halfway house facility shall house no more than 12
clients at any one time.



      (3)   No proposed halfway house facility shall be established
within one-half mile of any existing halfway house facility. This distance
shall be measured in a direct line from the nearest property line of the land
used for the existing halfway house to the nearest property line of the
proposed halfway house.



      (4)   Each halfway house facility must have qualified adult
supervision, on the premises, on a 24-hour basis in sufficient numbers to
provide proper supervision. The determination of sufficiency shall take into
consideration the needs for supervision and care of the individual residents.
Furthermore, the sponsor of the facility shall furnish a plan containing the
number and qualifications of all personnel, including management and direct
care personnel, having responsibility for any part of the service provided to
the residents; specifically, the sponsor shall indicate the staffing ratio
for the facility which shall specify the number of staff hours scheduled for
the needed care and service of each resident. There shall be an ongoing
planned in-service program embracing orientation, skill training and ongoing
education carried out to enable all personnel to perform their duties
effectively.

operate a halfway house facility.



      (7)   At a minimum, the halfway house facility shall meet the
licensing requirements of and be licensed by the appropriate department of
the state which has jurisdiction. The special use permit may be granted
contingent upon reception of the required license. However, the facility
shall not be occupied prior to the issuance of the appropriate state license.



      (8)   The halfway house facility shall meet the appropriate
requirements of the City Building Codes. Inspections shall be performed by a
team of inspectors. All violations found during the inspection shall be
corrected prior to occupancy. A halfway house facility shall be considered in
the same category as rooming, boarding and lodginghouses, with respect to
inspections. The special use permit may be granted contingent upon passage of
the inspection.



      (9)   A “house council” shall be set up during the initial
start-up period. The house council shall include representatives from both
the sponsoring agency, the resident clients and residents and/or property
owners from the surrounding neighborhood. It shall meet at least quarterly
for the purpose of reviewing the status of the halfway house facility and
resolving any problems that concern the neighborhood. Additional meetings may
be called if the need exists. The sponsoring agency shall supply a proposal
for the establishment and operation of the house council. The special use
permit shall include an approved plan for establishing and operating the
house council.



      (10)   A minimum of one off-street parking space shall be
provided for every two beds or fraction thereof in the facility. In addition,
one off-street parking space shall be provided for each full-time staff
member on duty.



      (11)   Each halfway house facility shall provide appropriate
policy and procedures which shall outline, and be followed in, the operation
of the facility for properly and promptly obtaining, dispensing,
administering and disposing of drugs and medications. The procedures, at a
minimum, shall require that all medications be kept in a locked cabinet and
made available only according to the instruction of the physician.



      (12)   A change in the sponsorship of any halfway house or a
change of any elements of the special use criteria shall constitute a new
use, and the full special use permit procedure shall be required.



   (D)   Recertification.  All facilities must be periodically
recertified. During the first year, each facility must be recertified at a
six-month and 12-month interval. After the first year, the recertification
process shall be yearly. The recertification process shall consist of:



      (1)   The sponsor of the halfway house filing a report,
indicating whether or not the facility continues to satisfy the conditions of
the original approval of the special use permit, including the established
criteria;



      (2)   Reinspection to assure continued compliance with the
City Building Code. Any violations found during the reinspection process
shall be promptly corrected; and



      (3)   A public hearing for each recertification shall be
scheduled before the Planning and Zoning Commission. The purpose of this
hearing shall be to obtain comments from the public concerning the operation
of the halfway house. The hearing shall be scheduled within one month after
the above-mentioned report is filed.



   (E)   City review.  In the event a problem results during a program
year which cannot be resolved through the house council, the Planning and
Zoning Commission has the authority to schedule a public hearing to consider
the issue. In the event the sponsoring agency fails to cooperate in
attempting to resolve the problem, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend and the City Council may revoke the halfway house special use
permit until the problem is resolved.



   (F)   Limitation.  This section shall not affect existing halfway
houses unless they are enlarged, extended or there is a change in the
sponsorship of any existing halfway house or a change of any elements of the

(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-8.4, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 17-3538, passed 2-6-2017)



§ 152.134  SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.



   The following development standards are established as criteria for the
review of site plans.



   (A)   Responsive to site conditions. 



      (1)   Site plans should be based on an analysis of the site.
This site analysis shall examine characteristics such as site context;
geology and soils; topography; climate and ecology; existing vegetation,
structures and road network; visual features; and current use of the site. In
addition to the standards listed below, petitioners must also follow the
regulations outlined in this Development Ordinance.



      (2)   To the fullest extent possible, improvements shall be
located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of
environmental sensitivity and to minimize negative effects and alteration of
natural features. Fragile areas such as wetlands and floodplains shall be
preserved as open space.



   (B)   Traffic and parking layout.



      (1)   Site plans should minimize dangerous traffic movements
and congestion, while achieving efficient traffic flow. The required number
of parking spaces shall be provided while maintaining city design standards
and adopted Building Codes and state accessibility requirements. The number
of curb cuts should be minimized and normally be located as far as possible
from intersections. Connections shall be provided between parking areas to
allow vehicles to travel among adjacent commercial or office uses.
Cross-access easements or other recordable mechanisms must be employed.



      (2)   Conflicts between pedestrians and vehicular movements
should be minimized. When truck traffic will be present upon the site, the
road size and configuration shall be adequate to provide for off-street
parking and loading facilities.



      (3)   Traffic studies may be required by the Development
Review Committee. When required, these studies shall be funded by the
applicant and prepared by a qualified state licensed professional engineer.
The studies shall include an analysis of the existing site traffic flow
patterns as well as the projected traffic flow patterns after the proposed
development for all adjacent and/or affected roadways. These traffic studies
should include the following as a minimum:



         (a)   Existing site.



            1.   Existing approach and lane level of service
(LOS) for weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours as well as for Saturday a.m. peak
hour by utilizing the most current version of the Highway Capacity Manual
(HCM). Also, the LOS for all intersections should be determined;



            2.   All intersections shall be reviewed and
evaluated with all Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Device (MUTCD) warrant
requirements for traffic signals and/or stop or yield signs to determine if
any warrants are met currently;



            3.   Determine the ADT from the traffic count
information utilizing the appropriate seasonal adjustment factors; and



            4.   Determine if additional turning or through
lanes are currently warranted as specified in the most current version of the
Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Bureau of Design and Environment
(BDE) Manual.



         (b)   Proposed site.  The most recent version of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual shall be
used to project proposed traffic volumes for the development utilizing the
appropriate category or categories of proposed development that most closely
match the categories as listed in the ITE Manual in order to analyze the
following:



            1.   The projected traffic distribution from the
development onto the existing or proposed roadway network;



            2.   The projected approach and lane LOS for
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours as well as for Saturday a.m. peak hours by
utilizing the most current version of the HCM. Also, the LOS for all
intersections shall be determined;



            3.   The projected impacts to the LOS to any
adjoining existing side street or commercial entrance;



            4.   All intersections shall be reviewed and
evaluated with all MUTCD warrant requirements for traffic signals and/or stop
or yield signs to determine if any warrants will be met with the projected
traffic volumes;



            5.   Determine the ADT from the projected traffic
information utilizing the appropriate seasonal adjustment factors; and



            6.   Determine if additional turning or through
lanes are warranted as specified in the most current version of the IDOT BDE
Manual based on the projected traffic volumes.



   (C)   Site layout.  Improvements shall be laid out so as to
preserve existing trees; minimize cut and fill; avoid unnecessary impervious
cover; prevent flooding and pollution; provide adequate access to lots and
sites; and mitigate adverse effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic, drainage
and utilities on neighboring properties.



   (D)   Consistent with Comprehensive Plan.  The proposed use and the
design of the site should be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.



   (E)   Historical context.  Site plans shall be designed to enhance
historic architectural resources as identified by the National Register of
Historic Places or the City Landmark Commission. Owners are encouraged to
allow site research for archaeological resources.



   (F)   Building materials.  The proposed site plan design shall
provide a desirable environment for its occupants and visitors as well as its
neighbors through aesthetic use of materials, textures and colors that will
remain appealing and will retain a reasonably adequate level of maintenance.
Buildings shall be in scale with the ultimate development planned for the
area. Monotony of design shall be avoided. Variations in detail, form and
setting shall be used to provide visual interest. Variation shall be balanced
by coherence of design elements.



   (G)   Relationship to surrounding development.  A site shall be
developed in harmony with neighboring street patterns, setbacks and other
design elements.



   (H)   Open space and pedestrian circulation.  Improvements shall be
designed to facilitate convenient and safe pedestrian and bicycle movement
within and to the property.



   (I)   Buffering.  Measures shall be taken to protect adjacent
properties from any undue disturbance caused by excessive noise, smoke,
vapors, fumes, dusts, odors, glare or stormwater runoff. Incompatible,
unsightly activities are to be screened and buffered from public view.
Specifically, buffering between a commercially or industrially zoned property
and a residentially zoned property shall comply with § 152.033(F)(1) when a
commercial or industrial use is developed.



   (J)   Emergency vehicle access.  Every site shall have sufficient
access for emergency vehicles.



   (K)   Mechanical equipment screening.  All heating, ventilation and
air conditioning roof-top equipment shall be screened on front and side
elevations, and rear elevations where abutting residential districts, by a
parapet wall or other fence equal in height to the equipment. The equipment,
if placed at grade, shall be screened by walls, fences or other elements as
designated on the landscape plan.



   (L)   Lighting.  The height and shielding of lighting fixtures
shall provide proper lighting without hazard to motorists on adjacent
roadways or nuisance to adjacent residents by extending onto adjacent
property. Cut-off lighting should be used in most locations, with fixtures
designed so that the bulb/light source is not visible from general view. (See
outdoor lighting regulations in § 152.032.)



   (M)   Refuse disposal and recycling storage areas.  All refuse
disposal and recycling storage areas should be located in areas designed to
provide adequate accessibility for service vehicles. Locations should be to
the rear of buildings or in areas where minimal exposure to public streets
will exist. Refuse disposal and recycling containers, and other equipment
such as grease containers or outdoor storage of materials such as pallets,
should not be placed outside of enclosures. The enclosures should not be
located in required aisles or landscape buffers. All refuse and recycling
enclosures should be screened by a solid fence (with the finished side facing
outward) or wall. Containers or material within the fence enclosure should
not extend above the height of the fence. The area should be secured by a
solid latchable gate. The use of chain link fences with slats is discouraged.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-8.5, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 15-3505, passed 11-16-2015)



§ 152.135  EXCEPTIONS.



   The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant exceptions from the site
plan requirements as may be reasonable if literal interpretation of one or
more provisions is impractical or would cause undue hardship because of
unusual conditions pertaining to the land in question.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-8.6, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.136  REVOCATION.



   Where a site plan has been approved and where no substantial
construction work is initiated within one year from the date approving the
site plan, then, without further action by the city, the site plan approval
shall become null and void. An extension may be granted by the City Council,
provided the extension is requested prior to the expiration of the original
site plan approval.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-8.7, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.137  ENFORCEMENT.



   It is the policy of the city that enforcement of this site plan review
requirement shall be deemed in the highest public interest. If any person,
firm or corporation violates the provisions of this subchapter the city may
exercise any or all of the remedies and penalties available under law,
including but not limited to the following:



   (A)   Imposition of a fine as detailed in the Fee Schedule of the
city code, codified as Appendix A to this chapter.  A separate offense shall
be deemed committed on each day the violation occurs or continues;



   (B)   If the violation occurs in connection with the development of
property or the building of structures, the city shall revoke all permits and
cause the cessation of any and all construction;



   (C)   The city shall file a complaint requesting the abatement of
the violation; and



   (D)   In addition to the fines herein, the city shall be entitled to
all costs of prosecution, including attorney fees incurred by the city, and
the cost, if any, of abating the violation.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 1-8.8, passed 1-4-2010)  Penalty, see § 152.999



§ 152.138  MODIFICATION OF APPROVED SITE PLAN.



   From time to time the proponents may make minor changes in the approved
site plan so long as the changes have been approved by the Director of
Planning and Public Works or his or her designee or, upon denial of approval
by the Director of Planning and Public Works, with the approval of the

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS; PARKING AND LOADING



§ 152.150  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to promote the safety and welfare of
the public by establishing minimum requirements for off-street parking,
loading and unloading of motor vehicles.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 2-1.1, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.151  GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.



   (A)   Scope of regulations.  The off-street parking and loading
provisions of this section shall apply as follows:



      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of
land established after July 6, 2010, accessory parking and loading facilities
shall be provided as required by the regulations of this subchapter. However,
where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this
chapter, and provided that construction is begun within one year of the
effective date, and diligently carried out to completion, only the less
restrictive parking and loading standards as required prior to the effective
date shall be provided.



      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or
premises shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor
area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified herein for
required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as
required herein shall be provided for the increase in intensity of use.



      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure is
changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for the new use.



   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities.  Accessory
off-street parking or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as
the building or use served, and which were in existence on July 6, 2010 or
were provided voluntarily after the effective date, shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below
the requirements of this subchapter for a similar new building or use.



   (C)   Central Business District parking requirements.  For the
purpose of allowing the existing mix and density of uses within the B3
Central Business District, additional off-street parking is not required.



   (D)   Permissive parking and loading facilities.  Nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street
parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings
provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design,
improvement and operation of the facilities are adhered to.



   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities.  When required
parking facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which
the building or use served by the facilities is located, they shall be and
remain in the same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the
building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. No off-site
parking facilities shall be authorized, and no occupancy permit shall be
issued where the plans call for parking facilities to be located on a lot
other than on the same zoning lot as the principal use, until and unless the
Planning and Zoning Commission has reviewed the plans, heard the applicant
and made findings that the zoning lot and the remote site are in common
ownership and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all
times during the life of the proposed use or building. Properties in the B3
Central Business District are excluded from this provision.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 2-1.2, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 15-3505, passed 11-16-2015)



§ 152.152  PARKING REGULATIONS.



   (A)   Use of parking facilities.  Off-street parking facilities
accessory to residential uses located in any residential district shall be
used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants of
the dwelling structures to which the parking facilities are accessory or by
guests of the occupants. Except for use associated with a permitted home
occupation, required parking facilities accessory to residential structures
shall not be used for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees,
owners, tenants, visitors or customers of business or manufacturing
establishments.



   (B)   Joint parking facilities.  Notwithstanding any other parking
requirements set forth in this DO, a joint parking facility may be applied
where mixed-uses are proposed and the mix of uses creates staggered peak
periods of parking demand. A joint parking facility allows the property
developer to use parking spaces more efficiently by allowing the same spaces
to be “shared” by various land uses, thus reducing the total amount of
required parking. A shared parking program may include parking on the same
site or different sites subject to the provisions herein. In no case shall a
shared parking program include the parking spaces required for residential
uses.



      (1)   The Development Review Committee may approve a joint
parking facility upon application of a developer, provided that:



         (a)   Pedestrian access is provided to and from the
parking area and the building; and



         (b)   All other requirements set forth herein are met.
If denied, the applicant may apply for a variance per § 152.019.



      (2)   Parking spaces that are reserved for a specific business
purpose (e.g., reserved for doctors only) or designated and marked for use by
persons with disabilities shall not be counted toward meeting the shared
parking requirements.



      (3)   Those wishing to apply for a joint parking facility must
demonstrate to the Development Review Committee the feasibility of shared
parking pursuant to division (B)(5) below. The maximum reduction in the
number of parking spaces required for all uses sharing the parking area shall
be 20%.



      (4)   Shared parking spaces may be located on a different lot
than the use which it serves only where the following conditions are met:



         (a)   The parking is located no more than 300 feet from
the use that is serves. The distance between the use and the parking lot
shall be measured following a reasonable and safe walking route from the main
entrance of the use to the nearest parking lot;



         (b)   The applicant(s) for a building permit or
certificate of occupancy for the use which is to be served by a joint parking
facility shall submit a copy of a written agreement pursuant to division
(B)(6) below along with his or her application for the permit or certificate;
and



         (c)   There is no substantial conflict in the operating
hours of the building served by the shared parking program.



      (5)   Off-street parking facilities for properties with
separate buildings or uses or for buildings with mixed uses, may be provided
collectively on the zoning lot, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use. Cumulative parking requirements for mixed-use occupancies may
be reduced where it can be determined that the peak requirement of the
several occupancies occurs at different times (either daily or seasonally).
The shared parking report published by the Urban Land Institute may be used
as a guideline in the estimation of parking demand for mixed use buildings
and sites. Requests for reduced parking shall be submitted to the Development
Review Committee for approval. If denied, the request may be appealed to the
Planning and Zoning Commission.



      (6)   Shared parking study.  Determination of the shared
parking requirements shall be by detailed study which clearly establishes
which uses will utilize the shared spaces at different times of the day,
week, month or year. The study shall:



         (a)   Be based on the Urban Land Institute’s shared
parking study methodology or other generally accepted methodology;



         (b)   Address the size and type of activities, the
composition of tenants, the rate of turnover for proposed shared spaces and
the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads;



         (c)   Provide for a reduction by not more than 20% of
the combined parking required for each use;



         (d)   Provide for no reduction in the number of spaces
reserved for persons with disabilities or for a specific business purpose as
described above, and that the spaces will be provided as required by the
State Environmental Barriers Act, ILCS Ch. 410, Act 25, §§ 1 et seq., as
now in force and hereafter amended;



         (e)   Provide a plan to convert the reserved space to
parking area, if applicable; and



         (f)   Be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer and
Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her designee.



      (7)   Agreement for joint parking facility.  The developer(s)
applying for the joint parking facility shall submit a written agreement
approved by the City Attorney requiring that the parking spaces shall be
maintained as long as the uses requiring the parking exist or unless the
required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of
this DO. The developer(s) shall record the written agreement with the County
Recorder’s office prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate
of occupancy, and a copy filed in the project review file. The agreement
shall, at a minimum:



         (a)   List the names and ownership interest of all
parties to the agreement and contain the signatures of those parties;



         (b)   Provide a legal description of the land;



         (c)   Include a site plan showing the area of the
parking parcel and open space reserved area which would provide for future
parking;



         (d)   Describe the area of the parking parcel and
designate and reserve it for shared parking unencumbered by any conditions
which would interfere with its use;



         (e)   Agree and expressly declare the intent for the
covenant to run with the land and bind all parties and all successors in
interest to the covenant;



         (f)   Assure the continued availability of the spaces
for joint use and provide assurance that all spaces will be usable without
charge to all participating uses;



         (g)   Describe the obligations of each party, including
the maintenance responsibility to retain and develop reserved open space for
additional parking spaces if the need arises;

be located in front of the dwelling when side or rear yard parking is not
available. Safety curbing or a barrier shall be provided to define the limits
of this parking area and prevent encroachment into the front yard. Any
parking permitted by this division (E) shall be subject to the sight
visibility triangle provisions (Figure 152.031(B)(4)) of this DO, pertaining
to corner lot visibility.



   (F)   In yards.  Required off-street parking spaces may be located
in any yard except required front yards, but shall not be closer than one
foot to the lot line.



   (G)   Design and maintenance.



      (1)   Open and enclosed parking spaces. Accessory parking
spaces located on the same lot as occupied by the use served may be open
surface or enclosed in a building.



      (2)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas and
driveways shall be improved with a compacted macadam base, not less than six
inches thick, surfaced with asphalt, concrete, brick or some comparable
all-weather dustless material. Construction of the surfacing shall be
completed within one year of the issuance of a building permit. (See §
152.111(B)(8)(a)



      (3)   Lighting.  Any lighting used to illuminate off-street
parking areas shall be directed away from residential use or zone properties
in such a way as not to create a nuisance. (See lighting in § 152.032.)



      (4)   Signs.  Incidental signs are permitted in parking areas
in accordance with the provisions established in §§ 152.180 through

spaces and a main entrance to the use served. The location of off-street
parking spaces in relation to the use shall be as follows.



   (A)   For uses in a Residential or Agricultural District.  Parking
spaces accessory to dwellings shall be located on the same zoning lot as the
principal use. Spaces accessory to uses other than dwellings may be located

occupied by the principal use, but in no case at a distance in excess of 300
feet from the parking space to the main entrance.



   (B)   For uses in Business, Institutional, Office or Manufacturing
Districts.  All required parking spaces shall be within 1,000 feet of any
entrance. To the extent possible, required parking spaces shall be located on
the same zoning lot. If additional space is needed to accommodate the
required parking spaces, they may be provided on an adjacent lot within the
same or a less restrictive zoning district where an application for the
request has been submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. However, no parking spaces accessory to a use in a business or
manufacturing district shall be located in a residential district, unless it
is allowed by a special use as listed in the applicable district.

to the central loading area without crossing a street or alley. Additionally,
no lot served shall be more than 500 feet from the central loading facility;



         (b)   Required berths.  The total number of off-street
loading berths required shall be the sum total of berths required for all of
the properties served by the central loading facility; and



         (c)   Agreement.  Whenever the required off-street
loading facilities are collectively provided and used in a central loading
facility, the parties concerned shall execute written covenants and easements
assuring their access, retention, maintenance and use for those purposes. The
covenants and easements shall be reviewed by the Director of Planning and
Public Works or his or her designee, approved by the City Attorney, and filed
with the Department of Planning and Public Works.



   (D)   Yard requirements for off-street loading facilities.

§ 152.180  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.



   (A)   The City Council finds and declares that these regulations on
outdoor advertising signs are necessary to preserve, protect and promote the
public health, safety, morals, aesthetic beauty and general welfare of the
city.



   (B)   The sign regulations, controls and provisions set forth in
this subchapter and §§ 152.205 through 152.220, and 152.230 through 152.233
are made in accordance with an overall plan and program for the public
safety, area development, preservation of property values and the general
welfare of the city, and are intended to aid in traffic control and traffic
safety; lessen congestion of land and air space; provide against undue
concentrations of signs which distract and endanger traffic safety and
traffic flow; establish reasonable standards for commercial and other
advertising through the use of signs in order to maintain and encourage
business activity and area development; avoid uncontrolled proliferation of
signs; recognize the rights of the public in roads, streets and highways;
preserve the wholesome and attractive character of the city; and to recognize
that the general welfare includes a community plan that provides for a
community that shall be beautiful as well as healthful, spacious as well as
clean, and well balanced in its growth and development.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 3-1.1, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.181  APPLICABILITY.



   No outdoor sign in the city shall be constructed, erected, converted,
altered, rebuilt, enlarged, remodeled, relocated or expanded until a permit
for the sign has been obtained in accordance with the standards and
procedures set out in this subchapter. However, no permit shall be required
for routine maintenance as defined herein.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 3-1.2, passed 1-4-2010)  Penalty, see § 152.999



§ 152.182  EXEMPTIONS.



   This subchapter shall not apply to the following types of signs,
provided the signs comply with the installation provisions of § 152.187:



   (A)   Traffic signs, municipal signs, state signs, legal notices,
railroad crossing signs and similar noncommercial signs in the public
interest or erected by a public officer in the performance of a public duty;



   (B)   Temporary displays, including holiday lights, decorations,
painted window areas, works of art, flags (not exceeding 50 square feet),
memorial signs, religious or historic symbols and other displays with no
commercial message;



   (C)   Instructional, not exceeding five square feet in area, which
provide direction or warning and are located entirely on the property to
which they pertain to identify restrooms, public telephones, walkways,
parking lot entrances and exits, and features of a similar nature or with
respect to warnings, “no trespassing,” “no dumping” and similar
warning signs. Parking lot entrance and exit signs shall not exceed five feet
in height. All instructional signs shall be set back at least 18 inches from
all property lines; and



   (D)   Non-electrical business nameplates denoting the business name

(Ord. 10-3277, § 3-1.4, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.183  COMPUTATION.



   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and
sign height.



   (A)   Computation of area of individual signs.  The area of a sign
face shall be measured by the smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle or
combination thereof which will encompass the entire sign face. The sign area
excludes any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when
the fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly
incidental to the display itself.



   (B)   Computation of area of multi-faced signs.  The sign area for
a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area
of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces
are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point
at the same time, and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure
and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the faces.

it properly painted, galvanized or otherwise treated to prevent rust and
deterioration of all parts and supports of the sign. The Building Inspector
may order the removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with
the provisions of this subchapter.



   (B)   For any sign or advertising structure that is unsafe or
insecure, is a menace to the public, or is being maintained in violation of
the provisions of this DO, the Building Inspector shall give written notice
to the owner, agency or person having the beneficial use of the building,
structure or premises upon which it is found. If, after notification, the
proper person fails to remove or alter the structure so as to comply with the
standards of this section within 15 days after this notice, the Building
Inspector is hereby authorized to have the sign or advertising structure
removed.



   (C)   In the event of failure by any party to reimburse the city
within 60 days for costs incurred for repair or removal ordered by the
Building Inspector, the City Council shall certify the charges for repair or
removal to the city’s legal counsel, who will be then authorized to file a
notice of lien in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds to foreclose
this lien, and to sue the owner of the real estate, or signs permitted, or
their agents, in a civil action to recover the money due for all the
foregoing services, plus all expenses and reasonable attorney’s fees to be
fixed by the Court. Included in the expenses recoverable by the city are the
costs of filing the notice of lien, foreclosing the lien and all litigation
costs, together with all office and legal expense incurred in connection with

   (D)   No portion of any sign shall be located closer than 18 inches
from any property line unless otherwise specified in §§ 152.230 through
152.233. Signs in the B3 Zoning District, however, may extend over the street
right-of-way, provided no part of the sign or its structural mount shall
project closer than 24 inches from the curbline. It is the duty of the
applicant to satisfy itself that all state requirements are met.



   (E)   Except in any B3 Zoning District, signs located on corner lots

unnecessary hardship to the sign user because of unique or unusual conditions
pertaining to the specific building or property in question;

detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or
general welfare;

the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity, nor
substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent area;

   (D)   Determination of conditions.  In granting a variance, the
Commission may impose any conditions regarding the location, character or
other features of the proposed sign as it may deem necessary to carry out the

§ 152.209  OFF-PREMISES SIGNS.



   Off-premises signs which conform to the provisions of this subchapter
and §§ 152.205 through 152.220 or 152.230 through 152.233 shall be
permitted in the following zones: B1, B2, B3, M1 and M2. In B1, they shall be
set back to the building setback line or to the front of the actual building
line, whichever is less. In the remaining zoning districts where off-premises
signs are permitted the setback shall be 15 feet from all property lines.



   (A)   Legislative finding and declaration. 



      (1)   The City Council finds and declares that this section
regulating off-premises signs is enacted for the purpose of regulating excess
signage, encouraging the positive economic development of the city, promoting
the safety of the traveling public, protecting existing property values in
both residential and nonresidential areas, preventing the overcrowding of
land, promoting a positive community appearance as part of a concentrated
city-wide effort to protect and enhance the aesthetics of the city for the
enjoyment of all citizens of the city.



      (2)   The regulations are designed to prevent the
over-concentration, improper placement and excessive height, bulk, number and
area. It is recognized that, unlike on-premises identification signs which
are actually a part of a business, off-premises signs are a separate and
distinct use of the public thoroughfare. With a view to this distinction,
outdoor advertising signs are regulated differently from on-premises signs.
It is intended that the off-premises signs be located away from residential
areas, and that the signs be regulated to protect the character of the area
where off-premises signs are located, and to conserve property values in
these areas.



   (B)   Definitions.     For the purpose of this section, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.



      (1)   BACK-TO-BACK SIGN.  A structure with two parallel and
directly opposite signs with their faces oriented in opposite directions
located not more than 15 feet apart. A BACK-TO-BACK SIGN shall constitute one
sign except for permit fee purposes. There shall be a maximum of two sign
faces.



      (2)   OFF-PREMISES SIGN.  A sign which is supported by one or
more poles, uprights or braces in or upon the ground which are not part of a
building, but other than pole or pylon signs as defined in this chapter, and
advertises activities, goods, products, services or facilities that are not
sold or offered upon the premises where the sign is located; provided,
however, any sign authorized in this section is allowed to contain
noncommercial copy in lieu of any other copy.



   Figure 152.209: Off-Premises Sign Faces







      (3)   SINGLE-FACED SIGN. A sign with copy on one side only.



      (4)   V-TYPE SIGN. A sign in the shape of the letter “V”
with an angle no greater than 45 degrees. A V-TYPE SIGN shall constitute one
sign except for permit fee purposes. There shall be a maximum of two sign
faces.



   (C)   Spacing of off-premises signs.



      (1)   On all streets and highways within the jurisdiction of
this subchapter, no off-premises sign shall be established within 750 feet
lineally of any other off-premises sign.



      (2)   Free-standing off-premises signs shall not be
established within 75 feet, measured, of any free-standing on-premises sign
on the existing lot or applicable adjacent lot(s). This shall be measured
from the closest sign base.



      (3)   Off-premises signs shall not be established within 150
feet of a residential zoning district, measured from the base of the sign.



      (4)   Off-premises signs shall not be located within 500 feet,
measured lineally along the closest street frontage, of any park, playground,
church or school.



      (5)   No off-premises sign shall be erected, the top of which
is higher than 25 feet above the level of the adjoining ground, or the bottom
of which is less than ten feet above the ground.



   (D)   Size of signs.



      (1)   The maximum area for any one off-premises sign facing
shall be 300 square feet inclusive of any border and trim, but excluding the
base or apron, supports and other structural members. In the B1 District, the
maximum sign area for an off-premises sign shall be 100 square feet.



      (2)   The sign area shall be measured by the smallest square,
rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof which will encompass the
entire sign facing.



      (3)   Off-premises signs shall not have more than two sign
facings for each sign location. Double stacking of sign facings in a vertical
or horizontal configuration is prohibited.



      (4)   Signs may be single-faced, single-faced back-to-back or
V-type single-faced. Rooftop and wall-mounted billboards are prohibited.



   (E)   Other requirements.



      (1)   All off-premises signs, and the area around the base of
the signs, shall be maintained in a neat and clean appearance. All structures
and poles shall be maintained in an upright position and all papers shall be
firmly attached to the sign face. Any grass at the base shall be no higher
than 12 inches.



      (2)   Off-premises signs shall not be illuminated between the
hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. if situated with a display surface closer
than 500 feet from the nearest lot line of a property zoned for residential
use.



   (F)   Concrete footings.  Off-premises signs shall be set in
concrete footings of sufficient size and weight to prevent overturning the
signs.



   (G)   Nonconforming signs.  Any sign in existence on July 6, 2010,
which does not comply with the provisions of this section, may continue in
existence until such time as alterations are made to the sign or a new sign
is needed. Specifically, a sign shall not be rebuilt, relocated, enlarged or
extended without conforming to the requirements of this section. The sign,
however, may be repaired and maintained. The repainting or reposting of
display matters shall not be deemed an alteration.

§ 152.212  PERMITTED EXTRA SIGNS.



   (A)   Criteria.  Certain business operations are hereby found to be
unique with respect to their sign requirements and therefore justified to be
permitted to have extra signs.



   (B)   Examples.  These include:



      (1)   Filling/service stations.  Filling/service stations are
unique because their primary functions are performed out-of-doors in a manner
prescribed by state statutes. In addition to the signs permitted by other
sections of this chapter, the following signs are permitted uniquely to
filling/service stations:



         (a)   Two signs per pump island which designate the
function of the island as “self-service” or “full service.” The signs
shall not have more than two faces and shall not exceed three square feet per
face;



         (b)   One sign displaying the price of fuel sold, with a
maximum surface area of six square feet per fuel type. The signs shall not
have more than two faces;



         (c)   One nonilluminated sign identifying the service
performed in each service bay may be placed over the opening to each bay. The
signs shall have one face and shall not exceed three square feet each;



         (d)   One nonilluminated nameplate identifying the owner
or operator is permitted adjacent to the doorway of the station. The
nameplate shall have one face and shall not exceed two square feet in area;



         (e)   Temporary signs advertising batteries, tires, oil
or other products which are directly related to motor vehicles, if the signs
are located directly adjacent to a display of the product(s) described. The
signs may have two faces, however, their total area shall not exceed 15
square feet;



         (f)   One sign over each pump stand not to exceed 24
inches in height with length governed by the length of the pump itself;



         (g)   One wall sign on a detached car wash building,
provided that it conforms to all other provisions for wall signs as stated in
this section; and



         (h)   Any signs required by state or federal government.



      (2)   Theaters.  Theaters are unique because of the rapid
turnover of the name of their entertainment product. In addition to the signs
permitted by other sections of this subchapter, the following sign is
permitted uniquely to theaters:



         (a)   Each theater may have one sign of up to 50 square
feet which will accommodate changeable lettering copy;



         (b)   A theater’s changeable copy sign may have two
faces if it is free-standing, but both faces must be parallel and located no
more than two feet apart;



         (c)   A theater’s changeable copy sign may be located
on a marquee, provided it does not project above or beyond the structural
limits of the marquee; and



         (d)   Otherwise, a theater’s changeable copy sign
shall conform to the regulations for the sign type to which it most nearly
resembles.



      (3)   Unified business centers.  Unified business centers are
unique because of the concentrated development and their centralized
ownership characteristics. In addition to the signs permitted by other
sections of this subchapter, the following additional signs are permitted
uniquely to unified business centers:



         (a)   A unified business center may have one
identification sign for the center per frontage on a collector or higher
roadway in addition to the signs permitted for each separate business. The
permitted area of the identification sign shall be based upon a ratio of five
square feet per one acre of the site, up to a maximum of 150 square feet.
Tenant identification panels are permitted as part of the permitted square
footage of the center identification sign. Otherwise, unified business center
identification signs shall conform to the regulations of the sign type to
which they most closely resemble;



         (b)   Unified business centers may have common directory
signs to guide pedestrians to individual businesses on the site. The signs
shall be limited to one square foot per business listed on the sign. Centers
must have a minimum of ten businesses to qualify to have one directory sign
and may have one additional sign for each ten businesses; and



         (c)   Unified business center entrance sign:



            1.   Maximum of two signs per entrance;



            2.   Maximum sign area of 32 square feet per side;



            3.   Maximum of two sides per sign;



            4.   Minimum setback from property line of ten
feet; and



            5.   Shall be utilized for identification purposes
only (unified business center name, phone numbers and address only).

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS GENERALLY



§ 152.245  PURPOSE.



   Because each new subdivision accepted by the city becomes a permanent
unit in the basic physical structure of the community, all subdivisions
hereafter planned within the incorporated limits of the city and within the
unincorporated area lying within one and one-half miles beyond the corporate
limits shall, in all respects, be in full compliance with the regulations
hereinafter contained in this DO. These regulations are designed to provide
for the orderly and harmonious development of the city; for the coordination
of streets within new subdivisions with other existing or planned streets;
and to secure a uniform system of utilities and services.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-1.1, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.246  EXCEPTIONS.



   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual configuration or
is surrounded by development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in this subchapter would result in
real difficulties or substantial hardship or injustice, the City Council,
after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, may vary or
modify the requirements so that the subdivider may develop the property in a
reasonable manner, but so that at the same time, the public welfare and
interests of the city and surrounding area are protected and the general
intent and spirit of this subchapter preserved.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-1.2, passed 1-4-2010)



SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES



§ 152.260  WHEN REQUIRED.



   It shall be unlawful for the owner, agent or person having control of
any land within the corporate limits of the city or within one and one-half
miles of its corporate limits, to subdivide or lay out land into lots,
blocks, streets, avenues, alleys, public ways and grounds, unless by plat in
accordance with the laws of the state and the provisions of this DO.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-2.1, passed 1-4-2010)  Penalty, see § 152.999

   (A)   Plat of consolidation.  All or a portion of adjacent
residential properties may be combined upon compliance with the following
conditions.



      (1)   (a)   The owner or owners of the zoning lot shall
file for record in the office of the County Recorder a deed, duly executed
and acknowledged, which deed contains the legal description of all parcels to
be included in the new zoning lot (and the remaining reduced lot if
applicable), and contains a statement by the owner or owners that the
property therein described shall not be conveyed separately without the
written consent of the Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her
designee.



         (b)   This consent shall be given by the Director, if,
after inspection, it appears that no violations of the zoning ordinance or
other ordinances of the city would be created by the separate conveyance of
the lots of record contained in the zoning lot.



      (2)   Adjacent lots may be combined in their entirety or a
portion of one lot may be transferred to an adjacent lot through this
consolidation process to create one larger lot for development purposes.



      (3)   The separate tracts of land to be conveyed or designated
for building permit purposes because of the consolidation, shall not be less
than dimensions required to secure the minimum lot widths and minimum lot
areas as specified in this DO.



   Figure 152.261(A)(3): Process for Plat of Consolidation (Residential)







 



      (4)   As a result of the reduction or consolidation as
authorized in this section, no remaining part of an original subdivision
shall become a separately described tract having less than the minimum
dimensions required to secure the minimum lot widths and the minimum lot
areas as specified in this DO.



   Figure 152.261(A)(5): Consolidated Lot

Works or his or her designee,, the Inspection Division, subject only to other
applicable provisions of this code, is authorized to issue the building
permit requested for any separately described tract designated and set forth
upon the proposed plat, notwithstanding any provision of this DO to the
contrary.



   (B)   Minor plats.  Plats that consist of three lots or less and
which do not require the installation of public improvements other than
sidewalks may be considered minor plats.



   (C)   Subdivision plat.  Any division of land that is not a plat of
consolidation or a minor plat shall be considered a subdivision.



      (1)   There are three required steps in the subdivision
process:



         (a)   Pre-application conference;



         (b)   Planning and Zoning Commission review and
recommendation; and



         (c)   City Council review and approval.

SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS



§ 152.275  STREETS.



   (A)   All streets shall be designed in substantial relation to
topographic conditions and drainage; public convenience and safety; and
proposed uses of land to be served by the streets.



   (B)   Except within a Comprehensive Plan Development District, a
public street shall be provided for convenient access to all property within
the subdivision and access to adjacent properties as may be needed.



   (C)   Private streets shall not be permitted, except when the
subdivider submits sufficient evidence that there can be no public interest
in the private roads or streets. The developer or owner is required to place
road name signs at intersections in accordance with city regulations. All
private streets shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of
property and the safety of persons using the streets.



   (D)   The arrangements of the streets in a subdivision shall either
provide for the alignment and continuation, or appropriate projection of
existing streets in surrounding areas, or conform to an approved plan for the
neighborhood which meets a particular situation where topography or other
conditions make continuation of, or conformance to, existing streets
impracticable. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an
intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets
shall not be less than 150 feet.



   (E)   Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets; however, no
other streets shall bear names which duplicate, or so nearly duplicate so as
to be confused with the names of existing streets. The street names shall be
subject to approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   (F)   Courts, dead-end streets or other arrangements may be provided
if proper access is given to all lots from a dedicated street or court. All
dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs having a minimum radius of
40 feet of paved surface and a minimum radius of 50 feet of right-of-way.
Dead-end streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length.



   (G)   The location of major streets shall conform to the locations
designated on the transportation plan.



   (H)   The minimum width for rights-of-way shall be as follows:

§ 152.276  EASEMENTS.



   (A)   Utility easements shall be provided at the rear of all
residential lots and along the side lot lines and shall be at least ten feet
wide, and normally centered upon the rear or side lot lines; provided that
transformers be located on or behind the front yard setback line. Evidence
shall be furnished to the Planning and Zoning Commission that easement
provisions to be incorporated on the plat or in the deed have been reviewed
by the individual utility companies or the organizations responsible for
furnishing the service involved.



   (B)   An unobstructed easement, not less than ten feet wide, may be
required by the Planning and Zoning Commission through the center of blocks
more than 900 feet long where deemed necessary to provide circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other
community facilities. Walking area must be paved at time of installation and
a sign indicating the area as a pedestrian crosswalk easement is required.



   (C)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, by a
drainage way, channel or stream, or other body of water, appropriate
dedications or easement provisions, with adequate width or construction to
accommodate observed, computed or anticipated stormwater drainage through and
from the subdivision shall be made. The width of the easement or dedication
shall be dependent on the area of land drained by the watercourse but shall
not be less than 15 feet wide to allow access for construction and
maintenance equipment.



   (D)   Whenever any street planned to be continuous has been
temporarily dead-ended awaiting subdivision of adjacent land, a temporary
turnaround shall be provided by means of an easement which will terminate
upon extension of the street. The dimensions of the turnaround shall be a
minimum of 50 feet in radius.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-3.2, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.277  BLOCKS.



   No block shall be longer than 1,300 feet between cross-streets.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-3.3, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.278  LOTS.



   (A)   Lots shall generally front or abut on a public street, unless:



      (1)   Otherwise approved as a part of a Comprehensive Plan
Development District; or



      (2)   It is determined by the Director of Planning and Public
Works or his or her designee that it is impractical to serve a single lot
using a city street. In that case, a permanent access easement must be
provided connecting a city street to the subject property.



   (B)   All lots shall meet the minimum depth, width and area
requirements of the DO.



   (C)   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate
for the location of the subdivision, and for the type of development and use
contemplated.



   (D)   Flag lots are prohibited.



   (E)   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the
off-street service and parking facilities required by the applicable zoning
regulations.



   (F)   The fronting of residential lots onto major streets and
highways is to be discouraged; however, where this does occur, the lots
should be platted with extra depth and building setback to permit generous
distance between the building and the traffic way.



   (G)   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A
proportion of two and one-half to one shall be normally considered as a
desirable maximum for lot widths of 100 feet or more.



   (H)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street lines.

SUBDIVISIONS; REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS



§ 152.290  AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WITH FINAL PLAT.



   Receipt by the subdivider of the copy of the preliminary plat, together
with the approval of the Commission, City Council and county, when required,
shall constitute authority for the subdivider to proceed with final plans and
specifications for the installation of the final plat. Prior to the
construction of any of the required improvements, the subdivider shall submit
final plans and specifications to the City Engineer. If the City Engineer
shall find these plans and specifications to be in accordance with applicable
policies and standards of the city and this subchapter, he or she shall
authorize construction and approve the amount of bond, set by the
subdivider’s engineer. Following submission of the bond and approval of the
City Engineer, construction may be started.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-4.1, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.291  REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.



   The final plat of a subdivision shall not be approved unless:



   (A)   The improvements listed hereinafter have been installed; or



   (B)   The subdivider shall have filed with the City Council a surety
bond or certified check to ensure the construction of the improvements listed
in this part in a satisfactory manner and within the period specified by the
Council, the period not to exceed two years. The bond, letter of credit,
certified check or cashier’s check shall be payable to the city in a sum of
110% of the construction cost of the improvements as estimated by the City
Engineer and, if a bond is filed, it shall be in form with surety and
conditions approved by the City Attorney. A bond or certified check to ensure
improvements will not be required by the city for a subdivision or that part
of a subdivision which is located outside of the corporate limits of the city
if a bond or certified check to ensure improvement has been filed with the
county. If all improvements are not complete after two years from the date of
the bond or letter of credit is submitted, the city may utilize the funds to
complete the project.

Flexible pavement design in accordance with the Illinois Department of
Transportation Pavement Design Policy for Flexible Pavements for Class IV
Streets. (Min. 3 inches bituminous mat in accordance with the standard
specifications on 10 inches compacted aggregate base course.)



 



   (A)   Grading.  Each street shall be graded to its full width,
including side slopes. The elevation at the street right-of-way line shall be
six inches above the top of the curb. If drainage ditches are permitted in
lieu of curb and gutter as provided for in Table 152.294(2) above for surface
drainage, the slope from shoulder line to ditch shall not be steeper than 3:1
and the back slopes not steeper than 2:1.  Fill sections shall have slopes
not steeper than 3:1. All exposed areas shall be reseeded by the developer,
when weather conditions permit, to prevent soil erosion, which reseeding must
be effective and take.



   (B)   Curb and gutter. A curb installed along a street which is
intended to be used for local residential purposes, shall be one of the
standard designs for combination concrete curb and gutter as established by
standards of the Illinois Department of Transportation. Curb and gutter may
be of either the barrier curb or mountable curb type and shall have a gutter
width of not less than 12 inches. If the roadway surface is to be constructed
of portland cement concrete, the curbs may be formed monolithically with the
pavement (commonly known as integral curb) and shall conform to the
cross-sectional requirements referred to for combination concrete curb and
gutter. Openings for driveways may be constructed as shown for “depressed
curb” during initial construction, or the curb may be sawed and removed at
a later date and the driveway area reconstructed to the “depressed curb”
design.



   (C)   Aggregate base course.   Streets required to utilize an
aggregate base course shall utilize a Type B aggregate as specified in the
current edition of the Illinois Department of Transportation Standard
Specifications. The aggregate base course shall extend one foot beyond the
outside edge of the proposed curb and gutter or pavement edge if no curb and
gutter is required.



   (D)   Regulations minimum.  The regulations in this section
contained shall not prevent the subdivider from constructing higher grade
streets than specified in this DO.



   (E)   Cost estimate.  Where major streets, as shown on the official
plan, are located in a proposed subdivision, the city may require the
subdivider to submit a cost estimate prepared by a registered professional
engineer setting forth the estimated cost of construction of a minor street
where the major street is shown. The estimate shall be subject to the
approval of the City Engineer. The city may construct the major street as
shown on the official plan at the city’s expense and require the subdivider
to pay the city an amount equal to the estimated cost of the minor street.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-4.5, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.295  SIDEWALKS.

streets within the proposed subdivision, and on the side of any street
adjacent to the proposed subdivision as listed in Tables 152.294(1) and (2).
The sidewalks shall be installed, or the appropriate bond therefor posted,
before the plat may be recorded.



   (B)   Sidewalks may also be required to continue a walk on an
existing street, to link areas, or depending on the probable future
development as indicated in the city’s five-year capital improvement plan.



   (C)   Sidewalks shall be installed as each lot is built on in
accordance with the following construction standards. Sidewalks must also be
installed on undeveloped lots within three years of initial completion of
street improvements.



      (1)   Relationship to curb.  Sidewalks shall be located on,
along or upon the property or right-of-way line or on a line to be given by
the City Engineer when it is impossible or not feasible to build or construct
the same as aforesaid.



      (2)   Width.  Sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide in
residential areas, and five feet wide in commercial areas. See Tables
152.294(1) and (2).



      (3)   Thickness of concrete.  All sidewalks shall be
constructed of concrete at least six inches thick; provided, however, that in
situations where driveway locations are known at the time of installation of
the sidewalks, then the sidewalks shall be at least six inches thick in the
area where the sidewalk crosses the driveway, and the remaining portions of
the sidewalks may be constructed of concrete at least four inches thick.



      (4)   Other standards.  All sidewalks shall be constructed in
accordance with other applicable standard specifications of the city.



      (5)   Ramps at intersections.  Curbs shall be cut and
sidewalks shall be ramped at all intersections so as to enhance the mobility
of disabled individuals. Ramps shall equal or exceed the standards of the
Illinois Accessibility Code.

§ 152.297  WATER SUPPLY.



   The subdivider shall furnish the city at the time the preliminary plat
is filed a statement and description of the water supply which will be
provided. The water supply system shall be designed in accordance with the
requirements of the IEPA and the City Water Division. Water lines shall be
designed by a professional engineer in accordance with state Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Construction. The water system shall be
constructed under the direction, control and with the approval of the
Superintendent of the Water Division. All water mains shall be installed in
street rights-of-way or easements.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 4-4.8, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.298  SANITARY SEWERS.



   (A)   The subdivider shall furnish the city at the time the
preliminary plat is filed a statement and description of the sewage disposal
facilities which will be provided. The sewage disposal facilities shall be
designed by a professional engineer in accordance with recognized sanitary
engineering standards and meet the requirements of the IEPA. In all areas
where the public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, each lot within the
subdivided area shall be provided with a connection of the sanitary sewer,
the sewer connection to terminate not less than two feet inside curbline or
easement line. All connections to the public sewer system and the subdivision
sewer system and installation of sewage treatment facilities shall comply
with the ordinances of the City Sanitary District and the city pertaining to
sewers and all construction shall be subject to the approval of the City
Sanitary District.



   (B)   When sanitary sewers cannot be provided by the subdivider, the
lots shall have an area sufficient to provide adequate seepage beds. The
required area shall be shown in the engineer’s report, as provided for in
division (C) below. The soil seepage tests shall be made by a registered
civil or sanitary engineer.



   (C)   Results of soil seepage tests which have been conducted
throughout the area to be subdivided shall determine the ability of the soil
to dispose of sewage waste by seepage. Where grading is to be done, the tests
shall be made in the soil after finished grade is established. A sufficient
number of these tests shall be conducted to show all variable conditions
which might exist throughout the area under consideration. The tests and
proposed septic systems shall be approved by the County Health Department.



   (D)   Prior to approval of a subdivision plat, the applicant shall
provide the city written documentation from the City Sanitary District
certifying that there is presently sewer capacity, as defined by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency population equivalent, available to serve the
proposed subdivision.

shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site’s first Flood
Insurance Rate Map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the
requirements of this subchapter. In addition, any development located on land
shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a
flood source, but not identified as floodplain on the current Flood Insurance
Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of this subchapter.



      (2)   The Director of Planning and Public Works or his or her
designee shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior

      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance
were not granted;



      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;



      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or
safety or creation of a nuisance;



      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood
protection, rescue or relief operations, policing or repairs to roads,
utilities or other public facilities;



      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and



      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.



   (B)   Notification of impact on building.  The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the
requirements of the building protection standards of § 152.331 that would
lessen the degree of protection to a building will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;



      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of
the risk and liability.



   (C)   Historic structures.  Variances to the building protection
requirements of § 152.331 which are requested in connection with
reconstruction, repair or alteration of a historic site or historic structure
as defined in “Historic Structures,” may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of §§ 152.330 and 152.331 subject to the
conditions that:



      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and/or



      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic structure.



   (D)   Agriculture.  Any variance granted for an agricultural
structure shall be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of
the building’s unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the
following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in
this subchapter. In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood
and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at grade and wet-floodproofed.



      (1)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance
from the floodplain management regulations of this subchapter shall
demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive
floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood
hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures or
animal confinement facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered
agricultural structures.



      (2)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to
agricultural purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).



      (3)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural
structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e.,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring and the
like) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with § 152.331.



      (4)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with § 152.331. All of the building’s structural components
must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces, including
hydrostatic, buoyancy and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.



      (5)   Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment
must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they
are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with § 152.331.



      (6)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls,
subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with § 152.331(B).



      (7)   The agricultural structures must comply with the
floodplain management floodway provisions of § 152.330. No variances may be
issued for agricultural structures within any designated floodway.



      (8)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be
reviewed and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered
professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.



(Ord. 11-3327, passed 7-18-2011)



§ 152.336  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of protection required by this subchapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This
subchapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This subchapter does not
create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this subchapter or
any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.



(Ord. 11-3327, passed 7-18-2011)



§ 152.337  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This subchapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the
city to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including Ordinance 92-1439 adopted on March 2, 1992. However, this
subchapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to
achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this subchapter repeal, abrogate
or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this
subchapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.



(Ord. 11-3327, passed 7-18-2011)



§ 152.338  VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain
or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be
deemed to be a violation of this subchapter. Upon due investigation, the
Department of Planning and Public Works may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this subchapter exists. The Department of Planning and
Public Works shall notify the owner in writing of the violation.



   (B)   If the owner fails after ten days’ notice to correct the
violation:



      (1)   The city shall make application to the Circuit Court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this subchapter or make any other
order as the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this subchapter;



      (2)   Any person who violates this subchapter shall upon
conviction thereof be fined as set forth in § 152.999;



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and



      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.



   (C)   (1)   The Department of Planning and Public Works shall
inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood
insurance policy to be suspended.



      (2)   The Department of Planning and Public Works is
authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject
development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for
the issuance and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the
circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes
a suspension of the permit.



      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently
suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Written notice of the hearing shall be served on the permittee
and shall state the  grounds for the complaint, reason for suspension or
revocation; and the time and place of the hearing. At the hearing the
permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on his or her
behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.



   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking any other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

   (B)   No development shall be approved unless the City Engineer
approves a stormwater management plan which attenuates the acceleration of
runoff due to development. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN means a report, plans
and documents which identify the water which naturally flows to, from and
through the development, the means of controlling the stormwater runoff
release from the development, and the storage potential provisions for the
anticipated excess stormwater runoff.



      (1)   A stormwater management plan is required for all
developments which meet the following criteria:



         (a)   Residential developments of five or more acres
gross aggregate land area, including roads, utility rights-of-way and any

development; and



         (b)   Nonresidential developments of two or more acres
gross aggregate land area including roads, utility rights-of-way and any
other dedicated lands. Nonresidential developments of less than two acres, if
the amount of impervious surface is greater than 50% of the area of
development.



      (2)   The following activities or developments shall be exempt
from these regulations:



         (a)   The transfer of any existing building or use
rights for use of a single individual parcel, as it then exists immediately
prior to any sale or lease where the transfer or lease does not create any
additional parcel by exception;



         (b)   The dedication of land for public use to a public
entity, the vacation of any land so dedicated and the taking of property
rights through eminent domain or inverse condemnation;



         (c)   The construction of one single- or two-family
dwelling and/or farm-related structures on a single lot or the creation or
transfer of a single lot of ten acres or more, except where the acreage or
structures are at locations of future streets as designated in the official
Comprehensive Plan;



         (d)   The maintenance or improvement of an existing
public street or railroad by a public utility not involving redesign if the
work is carried out on land within the boundaries of the right-of-way;



         (e)   Work by any utility not including redesign for the
purpose of inspection, repair, renewal or construction on established
rights-of-way of any sewers, mains, pipes, cables, utility tunnels, power
lines, power poles, trunk lines or the like;



         (f)   The use of any land for the purpose of growing

         (g)   Individual installation of a building sewer,
service connection or lateral;



         (h)   Parking lots or additions to parking lots where
the total size is less than 5,000 square feet in area;



         (i)   Building additions of less than 2,000 square feet
where the construction adds less than 15% to the building size; provided,
however, that all additions within a five-year period shall be considered in
the aggregate;



         (j)   Developments of less than two acres located in the
B3 Central Business Zoning District; or



         (k)   Existing developed sites that are redeveloped with
a new impervious surface area less than or equal to the preexisting
impervious surface area, provided that the existing drainage patterns are not
changed and water is not allowed to flow over the surface onto the public
right-of-way.



      (3)   The developer shall be required to submit a site plan
and a statement, sealed by a state professional engineer, stating that the
development is exempt from the stormwater management plan requirements and
specify which exemption(s) are applicable.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 5-3.1, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.351  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.



   (A)   Preparation of stormwater management plan.  All computations,
plans and specifications related to the implementation of this subchapter
must be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer registered in this
state. After the development has been completed, a professional engineer
registered in this state shall certify to the city that the development was
built according to the plans and specifications approved by the city. All
exceptions shall be noted with explanations. The developer is subject to
corrective actions if changes are made without approval from the City
Engineer.



   (B)   Plan requirements.  Unless the City Engineer excludes
specific items, the stormwater management plan shall include but not be
limited to the following information:



      (1)   A topographic map of the project site, and a drainage
basin limits map and other pertinent data necessary to define flows entering
the development from adjacent land. Maps shall be of suitable scale and
contour interval, and include the extent of floodplains, calculated high
water elevations, the shoreline of existing lakes, ponds, swamps and
detention basins as well as their inflow and outflow structures, if any. Maps
shall also include the 50- and 100-year floodplain elevations for any streams
for which detailed flood studies have been prepared by the State Division of
Water Resources or federal agencies. Floodway limits should also be shown as
defined by available studies;



      (2)   The locations and invert elevations of all sanitary and
storm sewers in the developing area or in adjacent areas;



      (3)   Detailed calculations of runoff anticipated for the
developed site which indicates design volumes and existing and proposed
runoff rates for each portion of the watershed tributary to the storm
drainage system. The project engineer shall submit the calculations used to
determine the runoff volumes and rates as well as a restatement of the
criteria used throughout the calculations. Calculations are to be provided
for a five-year storm, 50-year storm and a 100-year storm event;



      (4)   A site plan of the proposed stormwater management
system, including the location and size of all drainage structures, storm
sewers, channels and channel sections, detention basins, outlet lines and
analyses of the effect of the improvement on the receiving outlet pipe, the
associated channel and high water elevations;



      (5)   The slope, type and size of all existing and proposed
storm sewers and other waterways;



      (6)   A plot or tabulation of storage volumes with
corresponding water surface elevations and of the basin outflow rates for
five-year, 50-year and 100-year water surface elevations for all detention
basins. If development work is to be performed in phases, the tabulations
should be performed independently for each phase;



      (7)   Design hydrographs of inflow and corresponding outflow
for both the 50-year and 100-year design runoff events for the site’s
projected final state of development and the calculated five-year, 50-year
and 100-year peak inflows from the development under natural, existing
conditions and under the projected final state of development for all
detention basins;



      (8)   A profile and one or more cross-sections of all existing
and proposed channels or other open drainage facilities, showing existing
conditions and the proposed changes thereto. In addition, the project
engineer will provide high water elevations expected from stormwater runoff
under the controlled conditions called for by these regulations and the
relationship of structures, streets and other utilities to the channels; and



      (9)   An engineering cost estimate detailing and explaining
all construction costs associated with the stormwater management plan.



   (C)   Design criteria for stormwater management plan.



      (1)   Methods of determining stormwater runoff rate and
volume.  Drainage and storage facilities shall be designed using one of the
methods of calculating the runoff discharge rate and total volume given
below. The City Engineer may approve other calculation methods.



         (a)   TR-20;



         (b)   Rational Method or Modified Rational Method;



         (c)   TR-55;



         (d)   Quick TR-55; or



         (e)   Pond - 2.



      (2)   Release rate. 



         (a)   The controlled release rate of stormwater runoff
from developments subject to this section shall not exceed the subject
property’s rate of runoff from a five-year storm prior to the proposed
development. The design rate at which stormwater runoff is delivered to a
designated stormwater storage area shall be based on a 50-year storm after
full development. The storm sewers, however, shall be designed to deliver a
runoff resulting from a ten-year storm, flowing under gravity conditions. The
balance of runoff is to be delivered by overland flow or in the storm sewers
under surcharge conditions.



         (b)   In the event the natural downstream channel or
storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the required release rate,
the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the
capacity of the downstream channel or storm sewer system without overflowing
its banks or surcharging of sewers.



      (3)   Development design.  Streets, blocks, lots, parks and
other public grounds shall be located and designed to give a continuous
surface relief path avoiding the flooding of buildings and structures, and to
preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels and detention
basins. Whenever possible, streams and floodplains shall be located within
parks and other public grounds.



      (4)   Prohibition.  It is unlawful for any person to
construct or cause to be constructed any drainage facility for the purpose of
the detention or retention of water within a distance of ten feet plus
one-and-one half times the depth of any drainage facility adjacent to the
right-of-way of any public highway without the written permission of the
highway authority having jurisdiction over the public highway. It is also
unlawful for any person to construct or cause to be constructed any earthen
berm such that the toe of the berm will be nearer than ten feet to the
right-of-way of any public highway without the written permission of the
highway authority having jurisdiction over the public highway.



   (D)   Storm sewers.  When storm sewers are required, storm sewers
and inlets shall be designed with sufficient design capacity to transport
surface water falling or draining onto the streets in a minimum ten-year
storm reoccurrence period under the projected final state of development.
Inlet spacing shall be determined in accordance with the most recent version
of the Illinois Department of Transportation Drainage Manual. The
developer’s engineer shall submit calculations showing compliance with
these regulations.



      (1)   The City Engineer may approve alternate drainage systems
if a detailed engineering study performed by a state registered professional
engineer demonstrates that the alternate drainage system provides a level of
service equal to the standard required without increasing maintenance and
operating costs to the city.



      (2)   Storm sewer service connections shall be provided for
each lot for all developments. If a sump pump is discharged into a storm
sewer or storm sewer service connection, an air gap or backflow prevention
device shall be installed in the sump pump line to prevent flooding should
surcharging of the storm sewer occur.



      (3)   The developer shall maintain temporary drainage courses
and structures that are not in the public right-of-way and/or are not part of
the proposed plat which are necessary to protect the public from flood risk
until they are replaced with permanent facilities. Maintenance of the
facilities shall be assigned according to § 152.352.



      (4)   When an existing drainage course in the area of the
proposed development abuts an existing closed conduit system, the developer
shall extend the existing conduit system in full compliance with this
subchapter.



      (5)   No plat of any development shall be approved unless the
developer provides for and guarantees the construction of a storm sewer
system adequate to serve the needs of the area when it is fully developed as
proposed in the general area plan or, if no general area plan is required,
the area covered by the development plat. The City Engineer shall approve the
location and design of the storm sewer system.



      (6)   Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to
facilitate the effective and efficient operation of stormwater facilities of
adjacent areas of the same watershed and to minimize operation and
maintenance costs.



   (E)   Detention facilities.  The increased stormwater runoff
resulting from a proposed development may be stored in appropriate detention
facilities including wet bottom reservoirs, dry bottom reservoirs, parking
lots and underground storage systems. The following standards shall govern
the design of detention facilities.



      (1)   Storage volume.  The volume of storage capacity
provided in detention facilities shall be sufficient to store the excess
stormwater runoff resulting from a 50-year rainfall as published by the
Illinois Department of Transportation in its Drainage Manual. This volume
shall be the required volume necessary to store the 50-year rainfall event
for the developed site, minus the released rainfall available for a five-year
rainfall event for the predeveloped site as determined in division (C)(2)
above.



      (2)   Release rate.  At no time during the design storm shall
the stormwater runoff release rate exceed the allowable release rate required
in division (C)(2) of this section.



      (3)   Release velocity.  Detention facilities shall release
stormwater at a nonerosive velocity. Protected channels receiving detention
discharge shall incorporate features to reduce velocity to nonerosive levels
where the discharge enters the unprotected channel.



      (4)   Spillway.  An emergency spillway shall be provided to
permit the safe passage of runoff generated from a 100-year storm or greater
under developed conditions.



      (5)   Freeboard.  Wet and dry bottom reservoirs, greater than
four feet in depth or larger than one-tenth acre in size, shall have adequate
capacity to contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff in a
50-year storm with at least one foot of freeboard above the water surface.
Wet and dry bottom reservoirs less than or equal to four feet in depth and
less than one-tenth acre in size shall be designed with freeboard adequate to
store the 100-year storm or six inches above the water surface elevation for
the 50-year storm, whichever is greater.



      (6)   Physical aspects of wet and dry bottom reservoirs.  To
ensure public safety, the protection of the facility, the ease of facility
maintenance, facility durability and aesthetics, the following shall be
considerations in detention facility design.



         (a)   The water depth near the perimeter of a storage
pool shall be limited. Access restrictions (fence, walls and the like) may be
required if land availability dictates greater water depth.



         (b)   The amount and geometric shape of available land
sites and location of the detention facility will influence depth and side
slopes specifications and other design factors.



         (c)   To facilitate maintenance and reduce safety
hazards, the side slopes for grassed areas should not be steeper than one
foot vertical in four feet horizontal.



         (d)   To promote surface drainage for grass mowing and
multiple purpose use, grass bottoms in detention basins should be designed
with minimum slopes of 1%.



         (e)   Provisions should be made to protect the facility
from soil erosion under all probable flow conditions imposed by the design
storm.



         (f)   Control devices should be adequately protected
from theft and vandalism.



         (g)   The facility’s landscaping should harmonize with
the surrounding area.



         (h)   The design shall facilitate control and removal of
debris both in the storage structure and in all inlet or outlet devices.



         (i)   Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations
and other structures should be protected and designed to minimize safety
hazards.



         (j)   To promote the facility’s durability, longevity
and physical appearance, construction specifications should require quality
materials and workmanship.



         (k)   The outflow structure shall have an orifice, weir
plate or similar control device to contain the basin’s outflow at the same
release rate specified in division (C)(2) above.



         (l)   To minimize debris, a debris catcher chamber shall
be installed at the inlet end of reservoirs greater than ten acre-feet. For
ponds smaller than ten acre-feet, a manhole constructed two feet deeper than
the inlet and outlet pipes may serve as a debris catcher.



      (7)   Dry bottom reservoir construction detail.  A dry bottom
reservoir should be designed to drain within 24 hours after a 25-year rain
event, and after associated flows have ceased. Further, the following
construction details shall apply to the design and construction of a dry
bottom reservoir.



         (a)   Grass and other vegetation used to line the bottom
and sides of the reservoir shall be able to sustain a minimum 30-hour period
of inundation.



         (b)   Whenever possible, the dry bottom reservoir should
be considered for other land uses during dry periods. Appropriate secondary
land uses include: baseball fields, tennis courts, playgrounds and parks.



         (c)   To expedite drainage, French drains shall be
included in any dry bottom reservoir having multiple land uses. Each tile
line shall have a cleanout and/or manhole at each end to allow maintenance.



      (8)   Wet bottom reservoir construction details.  Wet bottom
reservoirs shall be constructed with a permanent pool that is not considered
a part of the storage capacity of the reservoir. Only the volume above the
permanent pool of water may be included in the drainage calculations.
Considerations to be utilized in design and construction of a wet bottom
reservoir are the following.



         (a)   When possible, facilities should be provided that
completely drain the full reservoir, if needed.



         (b)   The minimum permanent pool depth shall be four
feet, except when stocked with fish, in which case a minimum of 25% of the
reservoir shall have a normal permanent pool depth of at least eight feet.
The desirable edge slope for safety shall be 1:8 with a maximum of 1:4.



         (c)   If fishing, boating and other recreational
activities are to be allowed, supplementary facilities for these activities
should be designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate codes and
ordinances.



         (d)   The design shall minimize problems of erosion due
to ice, wind or wave action.



         (e)   The design shall prevent pollution of the
reservoir. The operation and maintenance plan shall require the responsible
party to test the reservoir’s water quality twice yearly in accordance with

§ 152.352  CONSTRUCTION OF DRAINAGE FACILITIES.



   (A)   Construction timing.  Detention facilities in a particular
basin shall be constructed in the early stages of development to minimize
excess flow during construction, and to collect sediment, top soil and other
construction related materials which could flow into the drainage system
during development. Upon the completion of the land development, the
detention facilities are to be restored to the original cross-section
illustrated on the development plans which the City Engineer previously
approved. The City Engineer shall approve the manner and disposition of any
deposits removed from the facility. The bond for development will not be
released until the City Engineer has certified that the detention facility
has been restored to its original design cross-section. If parking lots or
other detention facilities are not available at the initiation of
construction, the developer shall provide alternatives to minimize flooding
and degradation of water quality until the permanent detention facilities are
constructed.



   (B)   Performance standards.



      (1)   Stormwater channel location. 



         (a)   In only a few special occasions will stormwater be
allowed to be transported in above-ground channels within a development. For
example, these channels may be centered on lot lines or entirely within the
rear yards of a single row of lots or parcels.



         (b)   In each case, a drainage easement with sufficient
width to facilitate maintenance and design flow shall be provided and
illustrated on the plat. The plat shall also include restriction on use of
the easements so that the channel is free and clear of all permanent and
temporary structures, trees, bushes and other vegetation.



      (2)   Storm sewer outfall.  The storm sewer outfall shall be
designed to adequately protect against erosion and scouring by means of
energy dissipators, gabions, rip-rap, falls or City Engineer-approved
alternatives.



      (3)   Manholes.  All utility manholes, except storm sewer
manholes constructed in an area designed for the storage or passage of
stormwater, shall be provided with a watertight manhole cover.



   (C)   Cooperative drainage structures.  Whenever possible,
developers are encouraged to construct storage facilities which serve more
than one development. In cases where this is deemed beneficial, the city may
consider and determine the terms and conditions of a recapture agreement to
establish financing and contractual repayment arrangements for the
construction of a detention/retention facility designed to serve the subject
development and adjoining properties. The agreement is subject to City
Council approval. If the development is outside the city limits, the
reimbursement shall be made when the entire development is annexed or in
compliance with other terms and conditions approved by the City Council.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 5-3.3, passed 1-4-2010)



§ 152.353  EASEMENTS AND ACCESS.



   (A)   If the city has agreed to assume ownership, maintenance and
operation of detention facilities, permanent easement for the detention and
conveyance of stormwater, including easements of access to structures and
facilities, shall be dedicated to the city.



   (B)   If another public body, i.e., park district, sanitary
district, drainage district and the like, has agreed to assume ownership,
maintenance and operation of the detention facilities or any part thereof,
and the City Engineer has approved an agreement for the ownership, as
described in § 152.354, providing for the ownership, maintenance and
operation, then permanent ownership and/or easements shall be granted to the
responsible public body. If a private corporation, e.g., developer,
maintenance corporation, homeowners’ associations and the like, is to
provide ownership, maintenance and operation of the detention facilities or
any portion thereof, and the City Engineer has approved an agreement for the
ownership, maintenance and operation, then the property shall be properly
deeded to the private corporation.



   (C)   The city, in all cases, will be granted perpetual access to
all sites.

§ 152.355  RECAPTURE AGREEMENTS.



   (A)   When runoff from other areas outside the development
necessitates construction of storm sewers of a larger size or greater depth
than is required by § 152.351(D), the city, with the developer and/or
adjacent benefitting property owners, may consider and determine the terms
and conditions, and enactment of a recapture agreement to set forth the
financing and contractual repayment arrangements for the installation of any
oversized storm sewers during the initial phase of the development.
Subsequent phases shall extend sewers in accordance with § 152.352 of this
subchapter. These agreements require City Council approval. If the

the entire development is annexed or in compliance with other terms and
conditions approved by the City Council.



   (B)   The developer will pay the cost of constructing and installing
all elements of the drainage facility required to manage the existing
stormwater runoff being accepted on-site. The City Engineer shall approve the
location and sizing of the drainage facility elements in accordance with
generally accepted engineering and drainage solutions.



   (C)   Secondary drainage facilities shall be required when primary
drainage facilities (storm sewers) are not adjacent to the lot to provide for
individual storm sewer service connections as required under § 152.351. The
City Engineer shall determine the need for the installation of the facilities
and, when required, the developer shall install the facilities in accordance
with § 152.359.



(Ord. 10-3277, § 5-3.6, passed 1-4-2010)
