They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the long term public interest must be their primary concern. Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above reproach.

(c)   Dedicated Service - All officials and employees of the City should be responsive to the political objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should adhere to the rule of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority.

(2)   Use of Public Property - No official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business.

(3)   Obligations to Citizens - No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.

(e)   Conflict of Interest - No elected or appointive city official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties. Personal, as distinguished from financial interest, includes an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association.

Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of officials and employees:

(1)   Incompatible Employment - No elected or appointive city official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties.

The prohibition against gifts or favors shall not apply to: (i) an occasional nonpecuniary gift, of only nominal value or (ii) an award publicly presented in recognition of public service or (iii) any gift which would have been offered or given to him or her if not an official or employee.

Impoundment of animals whose owners have been cited for violation of this section shall be at the discretion of the animal control officer. If the animal presents a clear and present danger to the public health or safety, it shall be the duty of the animal control officer or his or her agent to impound such animal.

(b)   Defined: For purposes of this chapter a vicious animal shall include:

(1)   Any animal with a known propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack unprovoked, to cause injury, or to otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or domestic animals; or

(2)   Any animal which attacks a human being or domestic animal without provocation;

(3)   Any animal owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of fighting or any animal trained for fighting;

(4)   Any animal which is urged by its owner or harborer to attack, or whose owner or harborer threatens to provoke such animal to attack, any law enforcement officer while such officer is engaged in the performance of official duty.

(c)   Complaint: Whenever a sworn complaint is filed in the municipal court against the owner of an animal alleging that such animal is vicious and in violation of this section, the municipal judge shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not the animal is vicious within the meaning of this section and thereby in violation of this section. The owner of the animal shall be notified in writing of the time and place of the hearing at least one week prior to the hearing. In making a determination, the municipal judge shall consider the following:

(1)   The seriousness of the attack or bite;

(2)   Past history of attacks or bites;

(3)   Likelihood of attacks or bites in the future;

(4)   The condition and circumstances under which the animal is kept or confined;

(5)   Other factors which may reasonably relate to the determination of whether or not the animal is vicious.

The municipal judge shall order the impoundment, the muzzling in accordance with subsection (d) and/or the confinement of the animal accused of being in violation of this section in a manner and location that will ensure that it is no threat to persons or other animals pending the outcome of the hearing. If such impoundment, muzzling or otherwise safe confinement is not possible or if prior court orders to restrain such animal have gone unheeded, the municipal judge may order the animal immediately destroyed.

(d)   Vicious Dogs to be Muzzled: It shall be the duty of every owner, keeper or harborer of any dog in the City, which dog is vicious or has been known to bite, chase, or run after any person or animal in the streets, alleys, or any public place in the City, to keep the same muzzled with a good and sufficient wire or leather muzzle, securely fastened so as to wholly prevent such dog from biting any animal or person until such time as a determination has been made by the court as to whether the dog is vicious or not. Any person owning, keeping or harboring any dog within the City limits contrary to this section shall be guilty of a violation of this code.

(e)   Immediate Destruction: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the animal control officer or any law enforcement officer from taking whatever action is reasonably necessary to protect himself or herself or members of the public from injury or danger, including immediate destruction of any vicious animal without notice to the owner.

(f)   Release of: If a complaint has been filed in the municipal court against the owner of an impounded animal for a charge under this section, the animal shall not be released except on the order of the municipal judge, who may also direct the owner to pay all impounding fees in addition to any penalties for violation of this chapter. The municipal judge may, upon making a finding that an animal is vicious or that it represents a clear and present danger to the citizens or to other animals in the community, order the animal to be destroyed in a humane manner by the animal shelter. Surrender of an animal by the owner thereof to the animal control officer does not relieve or render the owner immune from the decision of the court, nor to the fees and fines which may result from a violation of this section.

2-116.        Running at large.

It shall be unlawful for any person to allow any animal or fowl under his or her control to be or to run at large within the City. Any animal or fowl found at large shall be impounded as provided in section 2-117 or 2-207 (dogs).

(b)   In case the identity of the owner of the impounded animal or fowl cannot be ascertained, the animal control officer or police officer shall, upon taking any such animal into custody and impounding the same, make a record thereof, with a description of the animal and the date and place taken into custody and the place of impounding, and shall thereupon immediately post a public notice stating that the animal, describing the same with the date and place of taking, has been taken up, and that unless the charges of impounding the same, together with any license fees due and unpaid, are paid within three business days from the date of the notice, that the animal will be disposed of as provided in this code.

(c)   The animal control officer shall each month submit a report to the City Clerk showing the number of animals impounded and disposed of, and the fees collected pursuant to this article and shall pay those fees to the City Clerk for credit to the general operating fund.

At any time before the sale or destruction of any animal impounded under the provisions of this article, except for animals impounded under sections 2-115 (vicious) and 2-119 (rabid), the owner thereof may redeem the animal by paying the animal control officer or any person in charge, the impounding fee and all costs incurred as a result of such impoundment.

2-119.        Impoundment of rabies suspects.

(a)   Any law enforcement officer or local health officer may take up, upon private or public property, any animal which has bitten or scratched a person or other animal and impound the animal in the City pound, securely penned and separated from other animals, or in a veterinary hospital or animal care facility for a period of not more than 30 days during which time the local health officer shall determine whether or not such animal is suffering from a disease and, if not, the local health officer shall authorize the release of the animal upon payment by the owner of the boarding fee therefore. The health officer may authorize the keeping of any such animal on the owner’s premises if the owner produces a rabies vaccination certificate showing that the animal has valid rabies vaccination protection. Impoundment costs shall be borne by the owner. If, in the opinion of the local health officer, symptoms develop justifying a microscopic examination, then the animal shall be killed and examination made by the state board of health.

(b)   In lieu of the provisions of subsection (a), the owner of any such animal may, at his or her own expense, take such animal to any duly qualified and licensed veterinarian in the City for observation. Such veterinarian shall report his or her findings in writing to the local health officer. If, in the opinion of such veterinarian, a microscopic examination is justified, then the animal shall be turned over to the animal control officer or any law enforcement officer to be killed and examination made by the state board of health.

(c)   Any animal desired for observation by the local health officer under this section shall be delivered to the animal control officer or any law enforcement officer upon demand and shall not be withheld, hidden, or harbored. Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a violation of this code. Upon refusal of any person to so deliver such animal, the municipal judge shall cause a warrant to be issued for the arrest of such person, which warrant shall also provide for the surrender of the animal and shall be lawful authority for the apprehending and forcible taking of such animal.

2-120.        Animals bitten by rabid animals.

Whenever a dog, cat or other animal is bitten by a rabid animal or an animal later proved to have been rabid, it shall be the duty of the owner of the animal that is bitten, to report that fact to the local health officer and/or the police department.

2-121.        Vehicular accidents involving animals.

Any person who as the operator of a motor vehicle strikes any animal shall stop at once and shall immediately report such injury or death to the owner of such animal, or in the event that the owner cannot be ascertained, and located, the operator shall at once report the accident to the animal control officer or any law enforcement officer.

2-122.        Emergency; proclamation.

The mayor is hereby authorized whenever in his or her opinion the danger to the public safety from rabid animals is made imminent to issue a proclamation ordering all persons owning any animal in the City to confine the animal in a good and sufficient enclosures from which the animal cannot escape, or fasten such animal by means of a chain on the premises where the owner may reside, for such time as may be specified in such proclamation.

If the City Clerk has not received any protest against the kennel, the City Clerk may issue a renewal of an existing kennel license at the same location without any report from the animal control officer and zoning code enforcement officer. If the animal control officer or the zoning code enforcement officer finds that the holder of any kennel license is violating any zoning law, or any other law of the State of Kansas, or of the City, or is maintaining the facility in a manner detrimental to the health, safety, or peace of mind of any person residing in the immediate vicinity, he or she shall report such fact to the City Clerk, and the license shall not be renewed except after a public hearing before the Governing Body.

(c)   The animal control officer, the zoning enforcement officer, or any law enforcement officer shall have the right to inspect any premises licensed under this section at any reasonable time and nothing shall prevent the entry onto private property for the purpose of inspection.

(Code 2020)

Article 2. Junked, Abandoned Vehicles

8-201.        Finding of Governing Body.

The Governing Body finds that junked, wrecked, dismantled, inoperative, or abandoned vehicles affect the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens of the City because they:

(a)   Serve as a breeding ground for flies, mosquitoes, rats and other insects and rodents:

(b)   Are a danger to persons, particularly children, because of broken glass, sharp metal protrusions, insecure mounting on blocks, jacks or other supports;

(c)   Are a ready source of fire and explosion;

(d)   Encourage pilfering and theft;

(e)   Constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located:

(f)   Constitute a fire hazard because they frequently block access for fire equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.

8-202.        Definitions.

As used in this article, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

(a)   Inoperable means a condition of being junked, wrecked, wholly or partially dismantled, discarded, abandoned or unable to perform the function or purpose for which it was originally constructed,

(b)   Vehicle means, without limitation, any automobile, truck, tractor or motorcycle which as originally built contained an engine, regardless of whether it contains an engine at any other time.

8-203.        Presumptions.

Any one of the following conditions shall raise the presumption that a vehicle is inoperable:

(a)   Absence of a current registration plate upon the vehicle;

(b)   Placement of the vehicle or parts thereof upon jacks, blocks, or other supports;

(c)   Absence of one or more parts of the vehicle necessary for the lawful operation of the vehicle upon street or highway.

8-204.        Unlawful storage.

Except as provided in sections 8-205:206, it shall be unlawful for any person or agent, either as owner, lessee, tenant or occupant of any land within the City to park, store or deposit, or permit to be parked, stored, or deposited thereon, an inoperable vehicle unless the vehicle is enclosed in a garage or other building.

8-205.        Temporarily disabled vehicle.

The provisions of section 8-204 shall not apply to the parking or storage of a vehicle inoperable for a period of 30 consecutive days or less.

8-206.        Salvage dealers; screening.

The provisions of section 8-204 shall not apply to any person conducting a business enterprise in compliance with existing zoning regulations or who places such vehicles behind screening of sufficient size, strength, and density to screen such vehicles from the view of the public and to prohibit ready access to stored vehicles by children. However, nothing in this section shall be construed as to authorize the maintenance of a public nuisance.

8-207.        Administrative procedure.

Whenever an informal complaint is made to the City Clerk or notice is given to such officer of the existence of an apparent violation of this article, he or she shall within seven days thereafter cause to be served upon the person in possession or the owner of the real property upon which such inoperable vehicle is located a written notice.

Such notice shall inform such person of the violation and direct that he or she take action within seven days after receipt of such notice to comply with the provisions of this article or prosecution will be commenced for violation thereof. In the event such person fails to comply with the provisions of this article within such time the City Clerk shall notify the City attorney who shall commence prosecution under this article.

8-208.        Abandoned vehicles; authority to remove.

(a)   Whenever any person shall abandon and leave a motor vehicle on a highway or other property open to use by the public for a period of time in excess of 48 hours, the City may remove the motor vehicle from such highway or other property and place or store the same in a safe and convenient place.

14-304.      Notice of impoundment; storage of vehicle.

(a)   When Owner Present. When the police department intends to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to Section 14-302 and the owner of the motor vehicle is then present, the police department shall, before the motor vehicle is removed, provide the owner with a notice, in the form prescribed by the police department that the motor vehicle is being impounded, that towing and storage charges will be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle, that the owner may claim and regain possession of the impounded motor vehicle at the location to which it is being removed for storage without prepayment of towing and storage charges and that the owner may request a hearing as to the propriety of the impoundment and as to the amount of and the owner’s liability for the towing and storage charges. The notice shall also state the location where the impounded motor vehicle will be stored and the place where the owner may make his or her request for the hearing. The notice shall also state, in prominent language, that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five days after receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of his or her right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner; and that the motor vehicle be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after 15 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. The owner of the impounded motor vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that he or she has received a copy of the notice and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner.

(b)   When Owner Not Present. When the police department impounds and removes a motor vehicle pursuant to Section 14-302(a) and the owner of the motor vehicle is not present at the time of the impoundment, the police department shall, if such motor vehicle has displayed thereon a registration plate issued by the division of vehicles and has been registered with said division, mail a notice by certified mail to the registered owner thereof, addressed to the address as shown on the certificate of registration, and to the lien holder, if any, of record in the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state. The notice shall be in the form prescribed by the police department containing the same information as required by Section 14-304(a). The police department shall use reasonable diligence in determining the title owner, or if from a non-title state, the registered owner, of the vehicle, and shall inquire by mail of the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the title shows the owner resides, if registered in this state, as to whether there are any lien holders of record if the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed to be a resident of the state whose whereabouts are unknown and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

If the owner does not reside in the state, as appears from the motor vehicle registration and the owner cannot be served by certified mail at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, the owner shall be deemed a non-resident of the state and service shall be made on the Secretary of State as provided in K.S.A. 8-401.

(c)   Failure or Refusal to Sign Notice. If any person required by this section to sign a notice of impoundment willfully fails or refuses to do so, or if such person cannot be found, the police department shall note this fact on the face of the notice, which shall constitute prima facie evidence of delivery or service of notice as required by this section.

14-305.      Impoundment after request to leave motor vehicle.

In all cases wherein the owner or operator of a motor vehicle which is on a public street has requested that the motor vehicle be left unattended at that location, in lieu of impoundment of the motor vehicle pursuant to Section 14-302, the police department may honor said request for a period of time not exceeding 24 hours, after which time the motor vehicle shall either be removed from the location by the owner or operator or be impounded by the police department pursuant to Section 14-304. The police department shall be immune from liability for any damage, loss, or destruction of the motor vehicle occasioned by its being left unattended pursuant to the request of the owner or operator thereof, in lieu of impoundment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the police department to order the removal of a motor vehicle by its owner or operator or to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to Section 14-304 at any time whenever, in his or her judgment, the presence of the unattended motor vehicle constitutes a danger to the public safety.

14-306.      Release of motor vehicle from impoundment.

(a)   Generally. Unless the vehicle is impounded pursuant to Section 14-302(b) herein, the owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership satisfactory to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored. If the custodian is satisfied that the person making the request is the owner or his or her authorized agent, he or she shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or his or her agent. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police department nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release. At the same time as the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made within 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police department shall provide him or her an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount of his or her liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; provided, that if the owner or his or her agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle more than 40 days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and his or her liability for the towing and storage charges.

(b)   Security for Payment of Charges. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the Kansas Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the owner or his or her agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evidenced from the document establishing ownership, the owner or his or her agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle, from impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or his or her agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges.

14-307.      Hearing.

If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or his or her agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, as provided in Section 14-306, a date shall be set, not more than five days after the date of request, for the hearing. The city attorney shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearings required by this Section. At the hearing, the owner, his or her agent, or his or her attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his or her objections to (a) the impoundment of the motor vehicle and (b) (1) the amount of the towing and storage charges and (2) his or her liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or his or her agent requested the hearing more than five days but not more than 40 days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, his or her agent or his or her attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment: if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (b) below; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner’s objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner’s objections, the hearing examiner shall render his or her decision if the hearing examiner:

(a)   Finds that the impoundment was improper, he or she shall:

(1)   Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment and

(2)   Determine whether and to what extent the City shall bear the expense of the towing and storage charges; or

(b)   Finds that the impoundment was proper, he or she shall establish:

(1)   The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle and

(2)   The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, and a copy of the decision shall be furnished to the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, to the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored and to the City attorney. In the event that the impoundment was pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1102(b), the owner or occupant of the real property upon which the abandoned vehicle was located shall not be assessed the costs of towing and storage of the vehicle. Further, nothing within this article shall be construed to modify or affect the validity of the possessory lien of the person removing such vehicle from the real property established by K.S.A. 8-1102(b).

14-308.      Charges constitute a lien.

The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle pursuant to Section 14-302 shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to Section 14-307 that the impoundment was improper and if he or she determines that the City shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this Section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds pursuant to Section 14-306 that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this Section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but he or she may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released pursuant to Section 14-306(a). In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or his or her agent has provided security for payment of charges as required by Section 14-306(b), the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section.

14-309.      Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale.

The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle created by Section 14-308, to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided in Section 14-308 or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after 60 days from the date the motor vehicle is impounded by the police department. If the owner of the motor vehicle or his or her agent has provided security for the payment of the lien as provided in Section 14-306(b), the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created pursuant to Section 14-308 is still under impoundment 60 days from the date it is impounded by the police department and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1102. Publication, required by K.S.A. 8-1102, may be made before the termination of the 60 day period for a sale thereafter.

14-310.      Redemption.

If the City is to conduct the sale:

(a)   Any holder of a recorded lien or retained title on a motor vehicle to be sold by the City under the provisions of Section 14-309 may claim and take possession thereof, upon payment of accrued charges and estimated costs of publication of the notice of sale to the police department and the deposit with the police department of sufficient assurance by surety bond or otherwise, approved by the City attorney, that the motor vehicle will be forthcoming for public sale thereof or upon claim of the rightful owner prior to the sale. The police department shall, within three days, make a report to the City treasurer and deliver the charges and costs so paid to the City treasurer, taking a receipt therefore and filing it, together with a duplicate copy of the report to the City treasurer, with the records in his or her office. The funds shall be held in a trust account until final disposition of the motor vehicle. Not less than five days before the date for sale of the motor vehicle, the police department shall notify the lien holder or retained titleholder of the time and place for the sale, and the lien holder or retained titleholder shall deliver such motor vehicle to the police department at or before 12:00 noon of the day before the sale. At the sale the amount paid shall be credited on the bid of the lien holder or retained title holder. If the lien holder or retained title holder is the successful bidder for the motor vehicle, the police department shall report this fact to the City treasurer and then the funds previously paid by the lien holder or retained titleholder shall be relieved of the trust previously impressed and become the same as other funds received by the City for storage and costs of impounded motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is sold for a higher bid to any person other than the lien holder or retained titleholder, the police department shall report this fact to the City treasurer and the lien holder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him out of the trust account.

(b)   And if the rightful owner of the motor vehicle claims the same before the sale by payment of the accrued charges, the police department shall immediately notify the lien holder or retained titleholder in possession of the motor vehicle and he or she shall return the same to the police department within 12 hours. The police department shall report this redemption by the rightful owner to the City treasurer and the lien holder or retained titleholder shall be refunded the amount previously paid by him or her out of the trust account.

14-311.      Sale proceeds.

The proceeds of a public sale held pursuant to Section 14-308 whether such sale was conducted by the City or by any other person, after payment of the towing and storage charges and costs and expenses incident to the sale, shall be deposited with the City treasurer, if the owner of the motor vehicle is absent from the sale, for credit to the trust account. The funds deposited in the trust account pursuant to this section shall remain in the account subject to the order of the person legally entitled thereto, but if no claim is made for these funds within a period of one year after the sale, the funds shall become the property of the City, be released from the trust account and be paid into the general fund as miscellaneous revenues.

14-312.      Statutory procedures.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to augment, diminish, supersede, or otherwise interfere with any statutory procedure established by the legislature for the collection of unpaid towing and storage charges. The procedures in this article are supplementary and cumulative to any statutory procedures.

14-313.      Implementation of article.

The police department and city treasurer are authorized to make rules for the implementation and administration of this article.

14-314.      Reimbursement for discharged liens.

If a lien created by Section 14-308 and held by a private wrecker or towing firm is discharged by Section 14-308 pursuant to a determination by a hearing examiner that an impoundment was improper and that the City shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the City shall pay to the firm the amount determined by the hearing examiner. No payment shall be made until it is authorized by the City attorney.

Article 6. Tow Rotation Regulations

14-601.      Purpose.

The purpose of this article is to provide a uniform system for licensing and regulation of tow companies which are engaged in, or intend to engage in the practice of towing, removing and storing of motor vehicles at the request of the Louisburg Police Department. It is hereby declared and found by the Louisburg Governing Body to be of vital importance to the safety of the traveling public for disabled vehicles and vehicles found abandoned on public streets to be removed as promptly as possible; that the delay in removal can impede the movement of traffic and can cause further accidents and that the solicitation of tows at accident scenes can lead to unnecessary traffic congestion and unsafe conditions; and that the towing of vehicles is a matter affecting public safety. Therefore, vehicle towing should be subject to City supervision and administrative control for the purpose of safeguarding the public. It is further declared and found by the Louisburg Governing Body that in order to protect the public, to protect the rights of persons whose cars may be towed, and to preserve the peace and safety of the community, the practice of towing, removing and storing of motor vehicles are matters affecting public safety, and any person desiring to conduct such a business shall be required to obtain a license, enter into a tow service provider agreement, and obey the regulations as hereinafter provided. Any person desiring to perform tow services at the request of the Louisburg Police Department, and who meets the requirements of all other provisions of this Article shall be eligible to be placed on a rotation list and called on a rotation basis.

(a)   Shale backfill. Leave all joints exposed so that they can be examined during the pressure test.

(b)   Allow to stand overnight.

15-547.      Trenching and backfill.

Trenching bottoms shall be smooth and regular of either undisturbed soil or a layer of compacted backfill so that minimum settlement will take place. Pipe shall not be wedged or blocked. Voids shall be filled and compacted to level of trench bottom. The minimum cover shall be twenty-four (24) inches below finish grade. Sand & fill, gravel, or rock will not be permitted as backfill on a PE yard line installation.

Pipe shall be stabilized before testing and backfilling.

15-549.      Location.

PE pipe shall be installed only outside the foundation of any building or structure or parts thereof. It shall be buried with a minimum ground cover of twenty-four (24) inches. It shall not be installed within or under any building or structure or mobile home or commercial coach or parts thereof.

15-550.      Protective coated pipe.

Installation and material shall comply with this standard and the installation standard for Protected Coated Pipe IAPMO I.S. 13-84 of the U.P.C.

15-551.      Holiday detection.

Each length of pipe and every other component shall be visually inspected at the site of installation to ensure that it has not sustained any visually determinable damage that could impair its serviceability. Each coated length of pipe shall be instrumentally checked for defects in the coating prior to lowering into the ditch. Each imperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of a length of steel pipe must be repaired or removed. Coated steel gas piping installed underground in exterior locations shall be protected from corrosion by approved coatings or wrapping materials.

15-552.      Depth.

All horizontal coated steel piping shall have at least eighteen (18) inches of earth cover or other equivalent protection.

15-553.      Cathodic protection.

All steel yard lines shall be cathodically protected by no less than a nine (9) pound anode.

In order for the Commission to make a recommendation that a nominated structure or site should be designated as historic, the Commission shall make findings that such structure or site has sufficient integrity of location, design, materials, workmanship, or association to make it worthy of preservation or restoration; and possesses significant historical, archeological and/or architectural qualities, and thus qualifies for designation pursuant to one or more of the following criteria:

(1)   Its character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the community, county, state, or country;

(2)   Its location as a site of a significant local, county, state, or national event;

(3)   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the community, county, state, or country;

(4)   Its embodiment of distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style valuable for the study of a period, type, method of construction, or use of materials;

(5)   Its identification as the work of a master builder, designer, architect, or landscape architect whose individual work has influenced the development of the community, county, state, or country;

(6)   Its embodiment of elements of design, detailing, materials, or craftsmanship that render it architecturally significant;

(7)   Its embodiment of design elements that make it structurally or architecturally innovative;

(8)   Its unique location or singular physical characteristics that make it an established or familiar visual feature;

(9)   Its character as a particularly fine or unique example of a utilitarian structure, including, but not limited to farmhouses, gas stations, or other commercial structures, with a high level of integrity or architectural significance; and/or

(10) It has yielded or is likely to yield important historical or prehistorical information.

(e)   Recommendations: Within thirty (30) days after the close of the public hearing, if the Commission finds that the evidence submitted at the hearings meets the criteria for designation, it shall submit a recommendation to the Governing Body that the nominated historic structure or historic site meets the criteria for designation. The recommendation shall be accompanied by the following information:

If the Governing Body makes the designation, it shall do so by ordinance. The Governing Body shall not designate any structure or site unless the designation meets the public purpose of this Chapter. If the Governing Body chooses to reject the recommendation, it shall respond to the Commission with reasons for rejection of the nomination. The City Clerk shall provide a copy of the designation ordinance by regular mail to the owner(s) of record of the historic structure or historic site. The failure of the City Clerk to provide a copy of the designation ordinance to the owner(s) of record does not nullify the designation ordinance.

(Ord. 1026, Code 2020)

17-408.      Denial of designation.

17-409.      Amendment and rescission of designation.

(e)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.

Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.

(g)   Significant architectural and/or archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved; if such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.

(h)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property.

Any person who willfully constructs, reconstructs, alters, restores, renovates, relocates, stabilizes, repairs or demolishes any historic structure or historic in violation of this Chapter may be required to return the historic structure or historic site to its appearance and setting prior to the violation. Only the City shall have the authority to bring an action to enforce the provisions of this Chapter. In the event that the cost of returning the historic structure or historic site to its appearance or setting prior to the violation exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of the historic structure or historic site, the offender shall have the option of either returning the historic structure or historic site to its appearance and setting prior to the violation or paying to the City of Louisburg a dollar amount equivalent to the cost of reconstruction. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty.

(Ord. 1026, Code 2020)

17-603.      Appeal.

SECTION 605. STREET ACCESS STANDARDS
A. Residential Access. All residential developments and uses shall take direct access only to local residential streets except as provided below.
1. Individual residential uses shall take access to residential collectors to the minimum extent possible. The developer shall use cul-de-sacs, or align blocks to present the sides of lots, rather than front lots, on residential collectors.
2. Individual detached single-family residences may take direct access to a collector or arterial street only if, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, no other access options are viable and only if the developer is unable to provide a safe street access due to physical site limitations such as topography, sight distances, ownership patterns, etc. A residential street shall be required if the site can be served with a street. The Planning Commission may also require shared entrances or a private access easement for two (2) or more lots to keep individual access to a minimum.
B. Nonresidential Access to Arterials or Collectors. No land which is located in a residential district shall be used for a driveway, walkway or access to any land which is located in any business or industrial district. Nonresidential uses shall be permitted direct access to arterial or collector roads only if
1. The access meets the minimum spacing requirements specified in Subsection C below, and the site plan provides access to/for other properties at the rear or sides;
2. The access is temporary (see subsection E below); or
3. No other access options are viable, and the developer is unable to provide a street due to physical site limitations such as topography, natural features, and sight distance.
C. Access Spacing. All uses, developments, and streets shall abide by the following spacing provisions.
1. All uses shall be discouraged from having more than one (1) access point to a collector or arterial street, except where the additional access point meets the spacing requirements.
2. In instances where more than one (1) access point is requested, or access less than the specified spacing is requested, a traffic study shall be required to demonstrate that the additional access point(s) is required to move traffic out of the development under the following conditions.
a. The additional access relieves congestion at intersections spaced in accordance with the following:

b. Access points in excess of one (1) shall be designated as "right turn only" wherever possible. This designation shall minimize potential adverse impacts on the collector or arterial street capacity.
c. The additional access point(s) improves or leaves road performance on the arterial or collector unchanged. Regional traffic capacity should not be reduced to permit increased access.
d. The traffic study indicates necessary improvements are required in order to maintain levels of service, and the developer makes such improvements.
e. The developer makes all necessary improvements, in terms of turning lanes and by-pass lanes, to maintain a level of service at the nearest intersections.
D. Exceptions on Access Standards. The minimum access standards specified above provide for the safest access conditions. Conditions may arise in which the standards do not fit the context of the topography, land ownership, or existing conditions. Where the following conditions exist, the Planning Commission shall permit deviations from Subsections A, B, and C. The deviations may be in the form of temporary access (Subsection E) or they may be permanent. Also, the Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council alterations to the road or its speed limit to improve safety.
1. If the vertical or horizontal alignment makes the required location dangerous, the Planning Commission shall consider the following alternatives:
a. Permitting a temporary access with ultimate access via adjoining properties.
b. Permitting a closer spacing provided site distances are adequate. Aligning with the area's existing accesses may result in a better site distance.
c. If other access points are in the area, lowering the speed limit to provide safe site distances.
CITY OF LOUISBURG, KANSAS
ZONING REGULATIONS
ZONING REGULATIONS 2010 - amended - Ord 1099 - fences 2018 103
d. Coordinating a road improvement project with the development to eliminate a dangerous area.
2. Where existing access points are present, an access may be permitted even though it is too close to others, provided the access does not present safety problems.
3. Where internal roads cannot reasonably be provided, the Planning Commission may consider alternatives.
4. Where multiple land uses will exist, additional accesses may be permitted if a better design results. "Better design" requires one (1) of the following:
a. The land use will be better served by separate accesses to avoid residential/ commercial traffic conflicts and turning movements restricting access and/or disturbing a residential development's character.
b. Where a temporary access for one of the uses is reasonable, it shall be granted.
E. Temporary Access. No developer shall be denied a Building Permit or site plan approval for the sole reason that a property cannot meet the permanent access standards, provided the development plan meets all other applicable provisions of the City of Louisburg Zoning Regulations and Subdivision Regulations. A Temporary Access Permit may be granted which shall expire when the permanent access to the property, via adjoining parking lots, parallel access, or reverse frontage roads, becomes feasible. The property owners shall bear the cost of closing the temporary access and connecting to the permanent access location.

ZONING REGULATIONS 2010 - amended - Ord 1099 - fences 2018 123
1. Parking Area Screening. Off-street parking areas shall be screened from view of the public right-of-way and from adjacent lots zoned residential. Screening shall be accomplished by shrubs, earthen berms, walls or any combination of such materials. Required screens shall be located within a landscape buffer strip with a minimum width of five (5) feet. At least sixty (60) plant units shall be provided within the required buffer strip for each one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer strip. Plant units shall not be required if an earthen berm or wall design is approved. Parking area screening shall be designed to obscure views of parked cars from off-site. Landscaping provided to satisfy Right of-Way and Transition Buffer standards shall count toward these Parking Area Screening standards.
2. Interior Area. The following requirements shall apply to the interior of off-street parking areas. Landscaping provided to meet the Open Space, Parking Area Screening, Right-of-Way and Transition Buffer or other landscaping standards of this section shall not be counted towards meeting a project's Parking Lot (Interior Area) Landscaping requirements.
Benefits of interior landscaping include the addition of color and interest, relief from rows of parked cars and asphalt, shade and windbreaks, and assistance with vehicular circulation.
Parking lot perimeters are not included in the calculations of the interior planting. The required amount of landscaping is determined by the following table. Landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirements.
Landscaping Required
By Percent of Total Area
Total Site Area ( in square feet)
7,000 to
49,000
50,000 to
149,000
150,000
And over
Percent to be Landscaped
5 percent
8 percent
10 percent
The percentage shown may be accomplished through planting islands, landscaping between the parking lot and the building, and/or an addition to the setback. If landscaping is located within islands, such islands shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet wide. Landscaping between the parking lot and the building shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet deep.
A deciduous tree is recommended for every three hundred (300) square feet of planting area. For purposes of safety and visibility, trees must have a clear trunk at least six (6) feet above finish grade. Deciduous trees with low evergreen shrubs below is recommended.

All plant material used in this section must be from the list of plants provided or be approved by the Plan Commission.
3. Location. Parking Lot Landscaping shall be reasonably dispersed throughout off- street parking areas.
4. Planting Areas. The interior dimensions of any planting area used to satisfy Parking Lot Landscaping standards shall be sufficient to protect plant materials and to ensure proper growth. Planting areas that contain trees shall be at least seven (7) feet wide, and all planting areas shall be protected by raised curbs or wheel stops to prevent damage by vehicles and vehicle overhang.
D. Right-of-Way and Transition Buffers. The Right-of-Way and Transition Buffer standards of this section require landscape buffers to be provided and maintained when certain land uses are adjacent to one another or when adjacent to certain roadway types. The standards are intended to help ease the land use transition between areas of varying development intensity, to ensure land use compatibility, and preserve the appearance of roadway areas.
1. Determination of Right-of-Way and Transition Buffer Requirements. The following procedure shall be followed in determining the type of buffer required.
a. Identify the minimum zoning classification required to accommodate the proposed use. This is the "Proposed Development/ Zoning" classification of Column 1.
b. Identify the actual zoning classification of the abutting site(s). This is the "Adjacent Development/ Zoning" classification.
c. Identify the classification of the roadway adjacent to the site of the proposed development. This is the "Adjacent Street" classification.
d. Determine the type of buffer required on each building site boundary (or portion thereof) by referring to the Right-of-Way and Transition Buffer Table.
e. Refer to Description of Buffer Types and Options and select the desired landscaped buffer option from those set forth in that section. Any of the listed options, at the option of applicant, may be used to satisfy Right-of-Way and Transition Buffer requirements.

Existing parking area previously required shall not be used to satisfy required off-street parking for any new structures or additions to existing buildings, structures, or uses of land. Such existing parking space shall be maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the main building, structure or use remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided elsewhere as provided in this article. The only exception is that no off-street parking or loading space shall be required for any use in the "C-2" Central Business District.
SECTION 702. GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Utilization. Required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for the uses hereinafter listed shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses.
B. Residential Districts. One space may be provided in the front yard in all residential districts. Each required space shall have unobstructed access to the street. The maximum width of the driveway shall be twenty-seven (27) feet.
C. Accessory Use. Off-street parking shall be considered as an accessory use to the use for which the parking is provided. Parking not located on the same tract on which the main use is located must be located within the zoning district in which parking or storage lots are permitted as a main use.
In no instance shall off-street parking required by this article be located more than three hundred (300) feet (as measured along lines of public access) from the use which it serves.
D. Repair Service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in association with any off-street parking facilities.
E. Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this regulation results in a requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of 1/2 or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of 1/2 shall be counted as one parking space.
F. Mixed Uses. When a building or development contains mixed uses, the off-street parking requirements shall be calculated for each individual use and the total parking requirement shall be the sum of individual parking requirements.

A mobile home may be replaced on an existing utility hookup if such pad or hookup has not been discontinued or abandoned for the previous ninety consecutive days. A mobile home park must be entirely vacant for ninety days to be considered as abandoned.
G. Change in Use. If no external structural alterations are made which will expand the area or change the dimensions of the existing structure, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use as a special use permit application, provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall find that the proposed use is as appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board, may require conditions and safeguards to protect surrounding areas and properties. Once such use has changed, it may no longer be returned to the original use or any other less appropriate use.
H. Abandonment or Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned, for a period of ninety consecutive days, such use shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or buildings shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land or buildings are located.
I. Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
J. Nonconforming Residential Uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 904.C and 904.D, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and which is located in a business or industrial district, may be remodeled, extended, expanded, and enlarged; provided that after any such remodeling, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work.
K. Open Storage in Residential District. No existing use prohibited by Section 609 shall be continued in any residential district for more than six (6) months past the effective date of this ordinance.

a. To vary the applicable lot area and width, height and yard regulations.
b. To vary the applicable off-street parking and off-street loading requirements.
3. A request for a variance may be granted upon a finding of the Board that all of the following conditions have been met. The Board shall make a determination on each condition and the finding shall be entered in the record.
a. The variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or applicant.
b. The granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners represented in the application.
c. The strict application of the provisions of the zoning regulations of which the variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application.
d. The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare.
e. The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations.

C. Conditions of Determinations. To exercise the foregoing powers, the Board, in conformity with the provisions of this act, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken, may attach appropriate conditions, and may issue or direct the issuance of a building permit.
A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and a concurring vote of a majority of the entire Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination of the Codes Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant upon any matter which it is required to pass under these regulations, or to affect any variation in such regulation.

SECTION 1102. PLANNING COMMISSION PUBLIC HEARING
A. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on each proposed amendment and special use permit that is referred to, filed with, or initiated by it. The Planning Commission shall select a reasonable hour and place for such public hearing, and it shall hold such hearing within sixty (60) days from the date on which the proposed amendment or special use permit is referred to, filed with, or initiated by it. An applicant
CITY OF LOUISBURG, KANSAS
ZONING REGULATIONS
ZONING REGULATIONS 2010 - amended - Ord 1099 - fences 2018 166
for an amendment may waive the requirement that such hearing be held within sixty (60) days.
B. Notice of Hearing. All such proposed amendments or Special Use Permits first shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for recommendation. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, shall cause an accurate written summary to be made of the proceedings, and shall give notice in like manner as that required for recommendations on the original proposed zoning regulations. Such notice shall fix the time and place for such hearing and contain a statement regarding the proposed special uses or changes in regulations or restrictions or in the boundary or classification of any zone or district. If such proposed special use permit or if such amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the property shall be designated by legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration.
In addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed amendment or Special Use Permit shall be mailed by the applicant return receipt requested at least twenty (20) days before the hearing to all owners of record of lands located within at least two hundred (200) feet of the area which the application applies to. The applicant shall then furnish all return receipts to the City. If the City proposes a zoning amendment to property located adjacent to or outside the city's limits, the area of notification of the City's action shall be at least 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Such notice is sufficient to permit the Planning Commission to make a recommendation to the Governing Body on a proposed special use permit or to recommend amendments to zoning regulations which affect only a portion of the land described in the notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice.
C. Conduct of Hearing. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner and according to such procedures as the Planning Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule. Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by attorney. The Planning Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment or special use permit from any governmental official or agency, or any other person, firm or corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be made available to the applicant and any other interested persons and shall be available for review in the office of the Codes Administrator. The Planning Commission may also require such reports after such public hearing if additional information is deemed necessary. Such reports shall again be made available to the applicant and any other interested persons.

SECTION 1103. ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION
A. Recommendations. The procedure for the consideration and adoption of a proposed amendment or special use permit shall be in the same manner as that required for the consideration and adoption of the original zoning regulations. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt its recommendations and shall submit the same, together with a written record of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. Said recommendations may be for approval or disapproval, or approval for less area or a less intense zoning district, and reasons for the recommendation shall be included.
A majority of the members of the Planning Commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or denial of the amendment or Special Use Permit to the Governing Body. If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request or Special Use Permit, the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
B. Amendments to Text. When a proposed amendment would result in a change in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and determination as to the following items:
1. Whether such change is consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations;
2. The areas which are most likely to be directly affected by such change and in what way they will be affected; and
3. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the areas and zoning districts affected, or in the area of jurisdiction of such changed or changing conditions.

SECTION 1104. ACTION BY THE GOVERNING BODY.
A. Planning Commission Recommendation. When the Planning Commission submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of such amendment or Special Use Permit and the reasons therefore, the Governing Body may
1. Adopt such recommendation by ordinance;
2. Override the Planning Commission's recommendations by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body; or
3. Return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove.
If the Governing Body returns the Planning Commission's recommendation, the Planning Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new and amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by the respective ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the Planning Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the Governing Body following the Planning Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Planning Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly. The proposed rezoning or special use permit shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance.
B. Protest. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a zoning amendment or special use permit, if a protest petition against such amendment or special use permit is filed in the office of the City Clerk of Louisburg within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice,
CITY OF LOUISBURG, KANSAS
ZONING REGULATIONS
ZONING REGULATIONS 2010 - amended - Ord 1099 - fences 2018 169
signed by the owners of record of twenty (20) percent or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or to which the special use permit applies, or by the owner of record of twenty (20) percent or more of the total area required to be notified of the proposed rezoning or special use permit, excluding streets and public ways, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all of the members of the Governing Body.
C. Publication. If the Governing Body approves an amendment or special use permit application, it shall adopt an ordinance to that effect, but said amendment or special use permit shall not become effective until its publication in the official City newspaper.
If the official zoning map has been adopted by reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or boundary as amended, shall order the official zoning map to be changed or reflect such amendment and shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and shall reincorporate such map as amended.
SECTION 1105. MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AMENDMENTS
In order to recommend approval or disapproval of a proposed zoning district for amendment, the Planning Commission shall consider the following matters in order to determine whether the application is found to be compatible with them.
A. Character of the neighborhood.
B. Consistency with the comprehensive plan and ordinances of the City of Louisburg.
C. Adequacy of public utilities and other needed public services.
D. Suitability of the uses to which the property has been restricted under its existing zoning.
E. Length of time the property has remained vacant as zoned.
F. Compatibility of the proposed district classification with nearby properties.
G. The extent to which the zoning amendment may detrimentally affect nearby property.
H. Whether the proposed amendment provides a disproportionately great loss to the individual land owners nearby relative to the public gain.
SECTION 1106. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
Conditional uses are those types of uses which, due to their nature, may be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property values of the immediate neighborhood and its environs.

All notices shall contain a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission. The applicant shall furnish all return receipts to the City Clerk's Office.

C. Conduct of Hearing. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner and according to such procedures as the Planning Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule.
