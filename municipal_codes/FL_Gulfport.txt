PREFACE 
    This Code, as originally published in 1960, was an entire new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance No. 60-1 enacted February 2, 1960, superseded all ordinances not included therein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Supplement No. 33 printed in June, 1978, reflects the substantial revisions of the Charter effected through the passage of Ordinance No. 77-14, on November 10, 1977, and the revisions to the Code effected through passage of Ordinance No. 77-15 on November 10, 1977. This Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as the ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, zoning, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 12 is 12-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in a similar manner, i.e., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The parentheses which follow most of the sections in the Code embrace and designate the source of the material used. Where no historical citation follows a section, the material was officially adopted as of the date of the ordinance which adopts this codification. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to correlative charter provisions and relevant state laws. 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the innovation of the looseleaf system of binding and up-keep servicing for the City of Gulfport. With this new looseleaf system, the Code of Ordinances will be kept up-to-date continuously. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page affected, reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the codes with instructions for the manner of inserting and deleting the obsolete pages. To each such amendment will be attached an editorial footnote explaining briefly the effect of the amendment on the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof, as provided in the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintaining of the Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid confusion or misplacing the same, and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    Supplement No. 33 included, a new, comprehensive, integrated Index to the Charter and Code. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are direct cross references within the index to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    Time and effort have not been spared in the preparation of this Code and the 1978 Republication thereof. The publishers are most grateful to all persons for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the editorial work. 
    This Code of Ordinances is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Gulfport.

The Gulfport Community Redevelopment Agency shall utilize the funds and revenues paid into and earned by the trust fund for any community redevelopment purpose, delegated to it, as set forth in the Gulfport Community Redevelopment Plan, or as provided by law.

Said increments shall be determined and appropriated annually, and shall be that amount equal to ninety-five (95) percent of the difference between: 
(1)  The amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by the city, exclusive of any amount from debt service millage, on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the redevelopment area; 
(2)  The amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for the city, exclusive of any debt service millage, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the community redevelopment district as shown upon the most recent assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by each taxing authority prior to the effective date of this article providing for the funding of the trust fund. 
    In calculating the tax increment, the amount of the ad valorem taxes levied based on the city-wide debt service on city bonds shall be totally excluded from the calculation and shall continue to be used for their voter approved purpose and shall not be appropriated to the trust fund.

Nothing in this article, however, shall require the city or the Gulfport Community Redevelopment Agency to issue bonds or incur loans or other indebtedness as a condition precedent to the city depositing into the trust fund the amounts set forth herein. 
(Ord. No. 93-4, § 3, 5-4-93)

Sec. 7-1.1. - Limits of responsibility. 
    Notwithstanding any provisions of the chapter to the contrary, any provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to, the issuance of building permits, the inspection process, and the issuance of certificates of occupancy, do not in any way constitute an approval of or statement as to the adequacy of any architectural or engineering plans or designs for a structure, nor does it guarantee compliance with the building plans or the specifications of those plans. The scope of responsibility in the inspection process and the issuance of any building permits or certificates of occupancy is solely limited to a verification of compliance with the building codes of the City of Gulfport which are in force as of the date of inspection. 
    It is the adopted legislative policy of the city council of the City of Gulfport that the responsibility of the city shall be limited as is above set forth. This responsibility is as defined by the codes which are mandated to be enforced by the city and is also as is necessarily limited by the funds available for the accomplishment of this task. The definition of the level of code inspection efforts by the city is a legislative policy of the city council and is intended to provide a level of verification of code compliance that is reasonable and affordable. The city code inspection activity is intended only and exclusively for the benefit of the general public and is not intended to be for the benefit of individual persons using the structures or the owners or occupants thereof. 
(Ord. No. 83-3, § 1, 5-17-83) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 83-3, § 1, adopted May 17, 1983, provided for the addition to Ch. 7 of new provisions relative to limits of responsibility, but did not specifically designate the section number. Therefore, such provisions have been codified as § 7-1.1 by the editor.

No new building shall be occupied and no change in occupancy of a building or part of a building shall be made until after the building official shall have issued a certificate of occupancy therefore in accordance with the applicable building code, as the same may be amended from time to time. In multifamily and commercial structures a fire inspection shall precede the building (structural and code) inspection before a certificate of occupancy may be issued.

    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 10.5-6(b), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including pavement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 10.5-13(3). 
(3)  Mobile homes: 
a.  No mobile home shall be placed in a floodway or coastal high hazard area, except in an existing mobile home park or existing mobile home subdivision. 
b.  All mobile homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Specific requirements shall be that: 
1.  Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four (4) corners of the mobile home, with two (2) additional ties per side at intermediate locations and mobile homes less than fifty (50) feet long, requiring one (1) additional tie per side; 
2.  Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five (5) additional ties per side at intermediate points and mobile homes less than fifty (50) feet long requiring four (4) additional ties per side; 
3.  All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a force of four thousand eight hundred (4,800) pounds; and 
4.  Any additions to the mobile home be similarly anchored. 
c.  For all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved, it shall be required that: 
1.  Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the mobile home will be at or above the base flood level; 
2.  Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler are provided; and 
3.  In the instance of elevation on pilings: (1) lots are large enough to permit steps, (2) piling foundations are placed in stable soil no more than ten (10) feet apart, and (3) reinforcement is provided for pilings more than six (6) feet above the ground level. 
(4)  Floodways. When floodways are designated within areas of special flood hazard additional criteria will be met. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification by a professional registered engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection a. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 10.5-8 and this section, 10.5-9. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of any mobile homes, except in an existing mobile home park or existing mobile home subdivision. 
(5)  Coastal high hazard areas (V Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10.5-6(b) are areas designated as coastal high hazard area. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surge and hurricane wave wash; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide. 
b.  All buildings or structures shall be elevated so that the lowest supporting member is located no lower than the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water, except for breakaway walls as provided for in subsection (5)h of this section. Compliance shall be certified to by a registered surveyor. 
c.  All buildings or structures shall be constructed to the current applicable building code requirements and securely anchored on pilings or columns. 
d.  Pilings or columns used as structural support shall be designed and anchored so as to withstand all applied loads of the base flood flow. 
e.  Compliance with provisions contained in subsections (5)b, c, and d of this section, shall be certified to by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
f.  There shall be no fill used as structural support. 
g.  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage. 
h.  Breakaway walls shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used and provided the following design specifications are met: 
1.  Allow floodwaters to rise and flow freely under the structure; 
2.  Not permit the infill walls themselves to become waterborne debris; 
3.  Not cause the accumulation of waterborne debris: 
Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall be not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. A registered engineer or architect shall certify that the wall will collapse from a water load in excess of twenty (20) pounds per square foot and that the supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have one (1) percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year (hundred-year mean recurrence interval). 
i.  If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall not be designed to be usable for human habitation but shall be designed to be usable only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
j.  Prior to construction, plans for any structure that will have breakaway walls must be submitted to the City of Gulfport for approval. 
k.  Prohibit the placement of mobile homes, except in an existing mobile home park or existing mobile home subdivision. 
l.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway walls are used as provided for in subsection (5)h and i. 
(6)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. The subdivider shall have designed, built and maintained all required storm water retention or detention area(s) within the platted subdivision. 
d.  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including mobile home parks and subdivisions. 
(7)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except in the manner provided in the section 10.5-5, in the definition of "floor" relating to accessory storage.

(Ord. No. 87-3, § 10, 5-5-87) 
Sec. 10.5-11. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10.5-6(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities shall be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.

Sec. 10.5-12. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The planning and zoning board of adjustment as established by the city shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City of Gulfport in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment, or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court, as provided in Chapter 163, Florida State Statutes. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(e)  In passing upon such applications, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges; and 
(12)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(f)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(g)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant, to whom a variance is granted, shall be given written notice that when a structure is permitted to be below the base flood elevation the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The City of Gulfport shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. No. 87-3, § 12, 5-5-87) 
Sec. 10.5-13. - Permit procedures. 
    Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by The City of Gulfport and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials; drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

(5)  Provide a floor elevation or floodproofing certification after the lowest floor is completed, or in instances where the structure is subject to the regulations applicable to coastal high hazard areas, after placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor. Within twenty-one calendar days of establishment of the lowest floor elevation, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, or upon placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the City of Gulfport a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, floodproofed elevation, or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work done within the twenty-one-day calendar period and prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The City of Gulfport, shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

Sec. 11-76. - Backflow preventer criteria. 
(a)  The director shall evaluate the hazards inherent in supplying a customer's water system. If, pursuant to this article, an approved backflow preventer is required at the customer's water service connection or within the customer's water system, the director shall give written notice to the customer of the specific locations, types, and sizes of the required devices, and the reason for them. Backflow preventers shall be sized to match meter or pipe size at the required location. The cost to install the required backflow prevention assembly shall be recovered through the permit fee. The department shall schedule the installation of the backflow prevention assembly in accordance with the requirements of this article. Any required device within the customer's water system shall be installed by the customer within ninety (90) days of the written notice. All cost estimates provided by the department for new water service taps shall include the cost for the appropriate backflow prevention assembly in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  When the device is to be installed at the water service connection and must be installed on private property, the customer shall also be required to provide an easement or other license agreement for the installation of each backflow preventer. Such easement or license agreement shall not assign any responsibility to the department for the maintenance or repair of any private water system lines, valves, or fittings installed within the easement. 
(c)  The failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to provide for the installation of required backflow preventers within ninety (90) days shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such backflow preventers have been properly installed. 
(d)  Wherever the following conditions exist, an approved backflow preventer shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served, but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line: 
(1)  For premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not of safe bacteriological or chemical quality, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard; 
(2)  For premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality; or 
(3)  For premises having internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or intricate plumbing and piping arrangements, or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow preventer in the service line. 
(e)  The type of backflow preventer required, as provided in subsection (d) hereof, shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as determined by the director as follows: 
(1)  For premises where there is an auxiliary water supply and it is not subject to any of the other provisions of this subsection, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. 
(2)  For premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
(3)  For premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include, but are not limited to, sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
(4)  For premises where there are uncontrolled cross-connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer at the service connection. 
(5)  For premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer on each service. 
(6)  For premises where an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, an air gap separation at the service connection shall be required to protect the public water system. 
(7)  For premises where there is reclaimed water service for irrigation, there shall be no physical connection between the reclaimed water system and the customer's water system which is served by the public water system. Where such connections are found, disconnections shall be accomplished, and the public water system shall be protected against the possibility of future reconnection by a reduced pressure principle backflow preventer at the service connection. A dual check (three-quarter-inch or one-inch) or double check valve assembly (larger services) shall be required at all premises that may be served by reclaimed water. 
(8)  For premises where the metered use of potable water is permitted directly from a fire hydrant or other water system fixture for filling tank type vehicles (i.e., lawn maintenance and pest control vehicles), the water system shall be protected by a reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. 
(9)  For premises where temporary use of water is permitted directly from a fire hydrant or other water system fixture through a portable meter (i.e., construction activity), the water system shall be protected by a double check valve assembly.

Sec. 11-77. - Existing in-use backflow preventers. 
(a)  Any backflow preventer existing as of October 1, 1999, shall be tested at the owner's expense and certified that it is properly installed and properly functioning and shall then be turned over to the department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, the existing backflow preventer shall be upgraded to ensure an appropriate device is installed consistent with the increased degree of hazard. 
(b)  All backflow preventers installed as of October 1, 1999 that do not meet the requirements of this article but were approved devices for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements, be excluded from the requirements of this article so long as they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever the existing backflow preventer is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the director finds that the continued use constitutes a health hazard, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow preventer meeting the requirements of this article.

(d)  The fee for each classification of developed property shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Residential. The fee for property consisting solely of dwelling units is the rate for one (1) dwelling unit of each type existing on the property, multiplied by the number of dwelling units of that type existing on the property. (That is, fee = dwelling unit rate × number of dwelling units.) 
(2)  Non-residential. The fee for property with no dwelling units is the rate of one (1) EDU multiplied by a factor. The factor is obtained by dividing the total impervious area of the property in square feet by two thousand three hundred (2,300). (The resulting calculation is: Fee = EDU rate × (square feet of impervious area/2,300). 
(3)  Mixed use. The fee for mixed-use property is the fee for dwelling units as calculated in paragraph (1) above, plus any applicable additional amount, as defined herein. The additional amount is the applicable area, as defined herein, multiplied by the applicable non-residential EDU rate. The applicable area is the total impervious area on the property in square feet, reduced by the product of the number of dwelling units multiplied by two thousand three hundred (2,300). (The resulting calculation is: Fee = (dwelling unit rate × number of dwelling units) + (EDU rate × (square feet of impervious area/2,300) (number of dwelling units). Fractional remainders shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 EDU, and the number of EDU's shall not be less than one (1). An additional amount which calculates to a negative number shall be treated as zero. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum fee for developed property within the city, whether residential, nonresidential or mixed use, is equal to the rate for one (1) EDU for that type of property.

The board of adjustment shall, in writing, either grant or deny the petition. If the petition is granted, the director shall apply the adjustment to the fee for the requesting party for the retroactive period identified by the board of adjustment, but in no event shall an adjustment be applied retroactively for a period in excess of one (1) year prior to the date of the original adjustment request to the director. 
(f)  The director, upon discovering an error or oversight in the calculation of the fee, may initiate an adjustment of the fee, by documenting, in writing, the reasons for the adjustment. The director shall provide a copy of the written reasons for the adjustment to the affected fee payer prior to adjusting the fee, and in the event that the adjustment would require an increase in the fee, shall offer the fee payer an opportunity to file an adjustment request within thirty (30) days setting forth reasons why the adjustment should not be made. If no adjustment request is filed by the fee payer within the time provided, the fee adjustment shall be made by the director. If an adjustment request is made by the fee payer, it shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the adjustment proposed by the director shall not take effect until final disposition of the adjustment request by the director and exhaustion of all appeals provided in this section. No increase or decrease in the fee shall be retroactively effective more than one (1) year prior to the date the director's original notice of the adjustment to the fee payer.

Upon exhaustion of the administrative review and finalization of the administrative order by such board, the special master may exercise all powers granted herein.

In the event that the authorized board finds that the cited violation of the ordinance or code has not been properly interpreted, that provision upon which the violation is based, shall prohibit the hearing officer from proceeding with the enforcement of the alleged violation.

For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions.

    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death or the career average as a full-time firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member.

    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment.

(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five (5) years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means October 1, 1996.

    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total annual cash compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter, reportable on the member's W-2 form or Form 1099, and member contributions designated as employer contributions under section 414(h) of the code and shall also include all other tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. The term shall not include clothing, car or meal allowances, employer paid deferred compensation or lump sum payments of accrued sick leave or vacation time. For service earned after the date that a collective bargaining agreement is entered into after July 1, 2011 (the "effective date"), "salary" shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year accrued as of the effective date and attributable to service earned prior to the effective date, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after the effective date. Additional hours worked pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) shall not be deemed to be overtime. 
Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in section 401 (a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17)(B). "Compensation" means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995.

(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(f)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be limited to:

2.  Up to twenty-five (25) percent of the assets of the fund at market value may be invested in foreign securities. 
3.  The board shall not invest more than five (5) percent of its assets in the common stock, capital stock, or convertible securities of any one (1) issuing company, nor shall the aggregate investment in any one (1) issuing company exceed five (5) percent of the outstanding capital stock of that company; nor shall the aggregate of its investments in common stock, capital stock and convertible securities at market exceed sixty-five (65) percent of the assets of the fund. 
(3)  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in section 175.071, Florida Statutes, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers.

(6)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(7)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(8)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(9)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(10)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(11)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(12)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

Sec. 15-35. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount . Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions.

(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, but in no event shall the city's annual contribution be less than five (5) percent of the total salary of the Members. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 1, 4-21-09; Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2, 1-21-14) 
Sec. 15-36. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service, or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service or upon the completion of thirty (30) years of credited service, regardless of age. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age.

(b)  Normal retirement benefit . A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three and thirty-seven one hundredths (3.37) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
In the event that the total insurance premium tax rebates in any year are reduced such that the original dollar amount attributable to pay for the increase in the benefit accrual rate from three (3) percent to three and thirty-seven one hundredths (3.37) percent is not available, the accrual rate shall be reduced proportionally to reflect the reduction in the premium tax rebates. This reduction shall not reduce the benefit accrual rate below three (3) percent. This reduction shall apply to all active and retired members who have received the benefit of the increased benefit accrual rate and benefit adjustments to those receiving benefits shall become effective on the January 1 immediately following receipt of premium tax rebates for the calendar year. In the event that the total amount of the insurance premium tax rebates are subsequently increased, the benefit accrual rate shall be proportionately, prospectively increased, but not to an amount greater than three and thirty-seven one hundredths (3.37) percent per year of credited service. Any necessary reduction or restorative increase shall be apportioned equally between the reduction or increase requirement in this subsection and the reduction or increase provided for in subsection (f)(2) below. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (1) above, reduced by three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter. 
(e)  Annual supplemental payment. On March 1 of each calendar year, each retiree, or terminated vested person (effective retroactively for all past and present terminated vested persons), who is receiving benefits and their beneficiaries or joint annuitants shall receive a lump sum cost of living payment equal to three (3) percent of the previous year's state premium tax funds paid pursuant to F.S. ch. 175, provided however, that the total amount to be paid hereunder shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the previous year's state premium tax funds. In the event there are more than three (3) eligible payees, each payee shall receive an equal portion of the ten (10) percent of the previous year's state premium tax funds. 
(f)  Cost of living adjustment . 
(1)  The pension benefit payable to all retirees who retire after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives, and their beneficiaries and joint annuitants, and terminated vested members terminating employment after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives, shall be annually increased by two (2) percent beginning on the first of October following attainment of age fifty-five (55) and continuing until the October 1 following attainment of age sixty-five (65) (eleven (11) increases). Beneficiaries and joint annuitants of deceased retirees shall receive adjustments as provided for herein, based on the age of the deceased retiree. 
(2)  In the event that the total insurance premium tax rebates in any year are reduced such that the original dollar amount attributable to pay for this COLA is not available, the COLA benefit for future years shall be reduced proportionally to reflect the reduction in the premium tax rebates. In the event that the total amount of the insurance premium tax rebates are subsequently increased, the annual COLA amount shall be proportionately, prospectively increased, but not to an amount greater than two (2) percent. Any necessary reduction or restorative increase shall be apportioned equally between the reduction or increase requirement in this subsection and the reduction or increase provided for in subsection (b) above. 
(g)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city.

Sec. 15-37. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  The beneficiary of a deceased member who was in active status at the time of his death shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the lesser of: 
(1)  Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), or 
(2)  The greater of: 
a.  One hundred times the estimated normal retirement income, based on the assumption that the present rate of compensation continues without change to normal retirement date, 
b.  Twice the annual rate of compensation as of the date of termination of service, or 
c.  The single-sum value of the accrued deferred retirement income (beginning at normal retirement date) at date of termination of service. 
(b)  This benefit shall be payable whether or not the death is in line-of-duty, provided, however, that if the member was on medical leave of absence resulting from a job related injury or illness directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter for the city, he shall continue to qualify for this benefit. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-38. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to, the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to the greater of: 
(1)  Three and thirty-seven one hundredths (3.37) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of average final compensation (this benefit shall be adjusted in the same manner and as part of the adjustment provided for in section 15-36(b)); or 
(2)  Fifty (50) percent of the member's average final compensation. 
Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in section 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any full-time firefighter member with ten (10) years or more credited service as a full-time firefighter who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three and thirty-seven one hundredths (3.37) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service (this benefit shall be adjusted in the same manner and as part of the adjustment provided for in section 15-36(b)). Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants, tobacco or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall have terminated. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his or her condition, accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense), to the board annually, and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board may notify the retiree and schedule a hearing in accordance with section 15-42 to consider terminating the pension benefit. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the board of this fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his or her service shall be deemed to have been continuous, and the period for which the member 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the one hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsection 15-40(a)(1) or (2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, or the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed one hundred (100) percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed one hundred (100) percent of such wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten (10) years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of forty-two (42) percent of average final compensation and two and three-quarters (2.75) percent of average final compensation times years of credited service.

Sec. 15-39. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal retirement and based upon the member's credited service (and, if applicable, the member's average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate), as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided member survives to his otherwise normal retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit equal to the benefit the member would have received if he had survived, payable for ten (10) years and payable beginning at the member's otherwise normal retirement date. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-40. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations (see Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the, time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  The member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
b.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
c.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
d.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 15-41. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 15-37. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 15-41. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 15-36(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00; Ord. No. 2006-19, § 5, 9-29-06; Ord. No. 2009-04, § 1, 4-21-09; Ord. No. 2016-02, § 5, 5-17-16) 
Sec. 15-41. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-42. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-43. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement, with a copy provided to the city manager, containing the documents and information required by section 175.261, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-44. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2000-17, § 1, 9-19-00) 
Sec. 15-45. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of code section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustment to basic limitation for form of benefit . If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in treasury regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For purposes of applying the limits of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code in the case of a benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent single life annuity shall be determined as: 
a.  Effective for limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (i) the interest rate and mortality table specified in the definition of actuarial equivalent pursuant to section 15-31(a); and (ii) a five (5) percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table described in Revenue Ruling 2001-62; and 
b.  Effective for limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity payable under the plan at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit computed using an interest rate of five (5) percent and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(2)  For purposes of applying the limits of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code in the case of a benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent single life annuity shall be determined as the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, pursuant to section 15-31(a); 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (5.5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account . For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect . Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations . 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b) of the code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 15-38, or preretirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-37. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 15-38, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-37. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans . The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 15-45, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 15-45 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 15-45 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits . Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits . 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 15-50.5 and 15-50.6, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits . 
(1)  For purposes of applying the code section 415 (c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under chapter 1223, title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b).

The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year.

a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 15-36, section 15-37, section 15-39, or section 15-40 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 15-37) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

Sec. 15-50.4. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code, to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross incomes and the portions of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible.

This term shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by code section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from individual retirement accounts. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Sec. 15-50.6. - Prior fire service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 15-31, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time firefighter with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time firefighter for any other municipal, county or special district fire department in the state shall be added to his years of credited service, provided that:

(Ord. No. 2002-18, § 6, 11-19-02; Ord. No. 2010-14, § 6, 10-5-10; Ord. No. 2014-01, § 7, 1-21-14; Ord. No. 2016-02, § 8, 5-17-16 
Sec. 15-50.7. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Re-employment of terminated vested persons. Re-employed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(Ord. No. 2006-19, § 8, 9-29-06) 
Sec. 15-50.8. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; chapter 175 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 175, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 175.351. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("share plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members as follows: 
(1)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual "member share accounts" for all actively employed plan members and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member hereunder. Each member shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. Chapter 175 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain separate member share accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(2)  Share account funding. 
a.  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all members who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (c) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2015. 
b.  Any forfeitures as provided in subsection (d), shall be used as part of future allocations to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (c)(1). 
(3)  Allocation of monies to share accounts. 
a.  Allocation of chapter 175 contributions. 
1.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014 and prior to September 30, 2015 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current member of the plan, and each retiree who retires in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
3.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each member share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of credited service of the deceased member. 
4.  Re-employed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
b.  Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
d.  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the chapter 175 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
e.  Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(4)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (e) shall forfeit his individual member share account. Forfeited amounts shall be included and used as part of the chapter 175 tax revenues for future allocations to individual member share accounts on each valuation date in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (c)(1). 
(5)  Eligibility for benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary) or DROP participant who terminates employment as a firefighter with the city or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Retirement benefit. 
1.  A member shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to section 15-36. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
b.  Termination benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member's employment as a firefighter is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with section 15-39. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
c.  Disability benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to subsection 15-38(a) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to subsection 15-38(c), he shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
d.  Death benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member dies while actively employed as a firefighter, one hundred (100) percent of the value of his member share account shall be paid to his designated beneficiary as provided in section 15-37. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(6)  Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section 15-50.8 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the member share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(8)  Notional account. The member share account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from employment. The member has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(9)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(10)  Maximum additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, annual additions under this section shall not exceed the limitations of section 415(c) of the code pursuant to the provisions of subsection 15-45(k). 
(11)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 415(b).

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2005-09, §§ 1 and 2, adopted June 7, 2005, in effect repealed former div. 1, §§ 15-51-15-75, and added a new div. 1, §§ 15-51-15-76. Former div. 1 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2000-18, adopted September 19, 2000; Ord. No. 2002-17, adopted November 19, 2002; and Ord. No. 2003-09, adopted April 1, 2003. 

Sec. 15-51. - Definitions. 
(a)  As used in this article, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation shall mean one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a fulltime police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be twelve (12) consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Gulfport, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the police department, pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not re-employed as a police officer with the police department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the Member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of his accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his re-employment. 
The years or fractional parts of years that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five (5) years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means October 1, 1991. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed fulltime person, employed by the city, including a person employed during an initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the state. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer, reportable on the member's W2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. For service earned after the date that a collective bargaining agreement is entered into after July 1, 2011 (the "effective date"), salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year and shall also not include payments for accrued unused sick or annual leave. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year or accrued unused sick or annual leave accrued as of the effective date and attributable to service earned prior to the effective date, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after the effective date. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to the effective date, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on the effective date or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on the effective date. 
Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the city's municipal police officers' trust fund as contained herein and all amendments thereto. 
(b)  Gender. The masculine gender, where used herein, unless the context specifically requires otherwise, shall include both the feminine and masculine genders.

Sec. 15-52. - Membership. 
(a)  Condition of eligibility. All police officers who were members on October 1, 1991, and all future police officers shall become members of this system as a condition of employment. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a new employee who is hired as police chief may, upon employment as police chief, notify the board and the city, in writing, of his election to not be a member of the system. Current employees of the city who are selected to become police chief are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In the event of any such election, the chief shall be barred from future membership in the system. Thereafter, contributions to the plan in accordance with section 15-55 shall not be required, he shall not be eligible to be elected as a member trustee on the board or vote for a member trustee, and he shall not be eligible for any other benefits from the plan.

Sec. 15-53. - Board of trustees. 
(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibilities for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this article is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board is hereby designated as the plan administrator.

(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(f)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund.

For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan.

(5)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(6)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the power of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(7)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained. 
(8)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(9)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(10)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(11)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts concerning this pension plan, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. The city manager shall be notified in writing of any pending judicial or administrative proceedings to which the board is a party. Notice of any such proceedings shall also be posted in a conspicuous place in the police department. 
(12)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

In addition, the city shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund on behalf of each member in the amount of one (1) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(3)  Interest. No interest shall be credited to member contributions. 
(b)  State contributions.

(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05; Ord. No. 2006-08, § 2, 4-4-06; Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 15-56. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service, or the attainment of age fifty-two (52) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the City after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal two and eighty-eight hundredths (2.88) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
In the event that the total insurance premium tax rebates in any year are reduced such that the original dollar amount attributable to pay for the increase in the benefit accrual rate from two and seventy-five hundredths (2.75) percent to two and eighty-eight hundredths (2.88) percent is not available, the accrual rate in this section and accrual rates in subsections (a) and (c) of section 15-58, disability, shall be reduced proportionally to reflect the reduction in the premium tax rebates. This reduction shall not reduce the benefit accrual rate below two and seventy-five hundredths (2.75). This reduction shall apply to-all active and retired members who have received the benefit of the increased benefit accrual rate and benefit adjustments to those receiving benefits shall become effective on the January 1 immediately following receipt of premium tax rebates for the calendar year. In the event that the total amount of the insurance premium tax rebates are subsequently increased, the benefit accrual rate shall be proportionately, prospectively increased, but not to an amount greater than two and eighty-eight hundredths (2.88) percent per year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he remained a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement as his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (1) above, which is actuarially reduced from the amount to which he would have been entitled had he retired on his normal retirement date and with the same number of years of credited service as at the time his benefits commence and based on his average final compensation at that date, but in no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed three (3) percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the normal retirement date. 
(e)  Cost of living allowance. 
(1)  For all members of the police officers' retirement system retired and receiving benefits prior to October 1, 1991, the monthly retirement benefit due and payable to said member, or any beneficiary or joint pensioner thereof, is hereby increased by fifteen (15) percent. 
(2)  Effective retroactively to October 1, 2004, the monthly benefit being currently received by every retiree, including service and disability retirees, joint pensioners or beneficiaries who were receiving benefits on or before October 2, 2002, shall be increased by seven tenths of one (0.7) percent for each full year since the retirement of the retiree, but not to exceed a seven (7) percent increase. This is a one-time increase in these benefits. 
(f)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city.

(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable.

(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  In no event shall the single sum value of the benefit provided for in paragraphs (1) or (2) above exceed the greater of:

(7)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable.

(7)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

Sec. 15-58. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently-disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and eighty-eight hundredths (2.88) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of bloodborne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
A.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-healthcare setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
B.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
C.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
D.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
A.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
B.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
C.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior; or 
D.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits off-duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and eighty-eight hundredths (2.88) percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his or her condition, accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense), to the board annually, and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, member shall forfeit the right to his or her pension. The cost of the physical examination and/or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the one hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 15-60, subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed one hundred (100) percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed one hundred (100) percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten (10) years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of forty-two (42) percent of average final compensation or two and three-quarters (2.75) percent of average final compensation times years of credited service.

Sec. 15-59. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions without interest or the member may leave it deposited with the fund, as otherwise provided herein. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05; Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 15-60. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent, or fifty (50) percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  The member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
b.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
c.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
d.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 15-61. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 15-57. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 15-61. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 15-56(a) and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The Member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05; Ord. No. 2006-08, § 5, 4-4-06; Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 4-7-09; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 6, 5-17-16) 
Sec. 15-61. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation of beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predecease the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05) 
Sec. 15-62. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05) 
Sec. 15-63. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05) 
Sec. 15-64. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05) 
Sec. 15-65. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) (one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of code section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in treasury regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (51/2) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one (1) year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b) of the code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 15-58, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-57. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 15-58 or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-57. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten (10) years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 15-65, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 15-65 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year and or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 15-65 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 15-74 and 15-75, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a, the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b, the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b, may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the code section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half (21/2) months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (j) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b).

Sec. 15-66. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 15-56, section 15-57, section 15-59, or section 15-60 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 15-57) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under treasury regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(G) and treasury regulation section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 40l(a)(9) of the code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the treasury regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 15-57.

(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions.

Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Internal Revenue Code section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be one hundred (100) percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with treasury regulations section 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 185.08. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system which violates the requirements of F.S. ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05; Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 4-7-09) 
Sec. 15-68. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officers accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the state department of management services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 185 and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

(Ord. No. 2005-09, § 2, 6-7-05) 
Sec. 15-73. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code, to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457 (e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2002, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This term shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from individual retirement accounts. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Sec. 15-76. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a police officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit.

Sec. 15-77. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; chapter 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefits to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. chapter 185, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("share plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members as follows: 
(1)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual "member share accounts" for all actively employed plan members and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member hereunder. Each member shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. chapter 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain separate member share accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(2)  Share account funding. 
a.  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all members who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (3) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2015. 
b.  Any forfeitures as provided in subsection (4), shall be used as part of future allocations to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)a. 
(3)  Allocation of monies to share accounts. 
a.  Allocation of chapter 185 contributions. 
1.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014 and prior to September 30, 2015 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current member of the plan, and each retiree who retires in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member(not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
3.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each member share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of credited service of the deceased member. 
4.  Re-employed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
b.  Allocation of investment gains and losses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
d.  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the chapter 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
e.  Annual statements. Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(4)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (5) shall forfeit his individual member share account. Forfeited amounts shall be included and used as part of the chapter 185 tax revenues for future allocations to individual member share accounts on each valuation date in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)a. 
(5)  Eligibility for benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary) or DROP participant who terminates employment as a police officer with the city or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Retirement benefit. 
1.  A member shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to section 15-56. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
b.  Termination benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member's employment as a police officer is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with section 15-59. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
c.  Disability benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to subsection 15-58(a) or an off-duty disability benefit pursuant to subsection 15-58(c), he shall be entitled to one hundred (100) percent of the value of his share account. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
d.  Death benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member dies while actively employed as a police officer, one hundred (100) percent of the value of his member share account shall be paid to his designated beneficiary as provided in section 15-57. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(6)  Payment of benefits. If a member terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section 15-77 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the member share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(8)  Notional account. The member share account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from employment. The member has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(9)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(10)  Maximum additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, annual additions under this section shall not exceed the limitations of section 415(c) of the code pursuant to the provisions of subsection 15-65(k). 
(11)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 415(b).

    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions, without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the average salary of the five (5) best years of the last ten (10) years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time general employee, whichever is greater.

    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board.

    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a general employee, with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a general employee. A member whose employment is terminated or who is granted an unpaid absence by the city and who returns to the full-time service of the city as a general employee within twelve (12) months of such date shall receive credit for service accrued prior to the termination or leave of absence. If a non-vested member leaves the employ of the city, his accumulated contributions, if less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned. If a non-vested member is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. If a vested member leaves the employ of the city, his accumulated contributions, will be returned only upon his written request and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. 
In the event that a member of this system has accumulated credited service in another pension system maintained by the city as a police officer or firefighter, then such other credited service shall be used in determining vesting as provided for in section 15-98, vesting. Such other credited service will not be considered in determining eligibility for benefits or for calculation of benefits under this system. Only his credited service under this system on or after his date of membership in this system will be considered for benefit eligibility and calculation. 
The years or parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a general employee to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a general employee within one (1) year following the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from service, unless otherwise required by USERRA.

The member must deposit all missed contributions within a period equal to three (3) times the period of military service, but not more than five (5) years, following re-employment or he will forfeit the right to receive credited service for his military service pursuant to this paragraph. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Effective date means January 1, 1994. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    General employee means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of the city, including those in their initial probationary employment period, but not including certified police officers and certified firefighters employed by the city, the city manager, department directors and the city clerk. However, any department director or city clerk who was previously in the system and who has opted to again participate in this system pursuant to the provisions of section 15-92, subsection (3), and any general employee who is in the system but who is promoted to department director or city clerk and elects within ninety (90) days of the promotion to remain in the system shall be considered general employees for all purposes of this system. 
    Member means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve (12) month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means total compensation for services rendered to the city as a general employee reportable on the member's W-2 form, not including lump sum distributions for annual leave and sick leave, and plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. For service earned on or after January 2, 2012. Salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year accrued as of January 2, 2012 and attributable to service earned prior to January 2, 2012, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after January 2, 2012. In any event with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to January 2, 2012, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on January 2, 2012 or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on January 2, 2012. 
Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). "Compensation" means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Gulfport general employees' pension plan as contained herein and all amendments thereto.

(3)  All funds of the general employees' pension plan may be deposited by the board with the administrative services director of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the administrative services director of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the administrative services director or clearly identified as such funds of the general employees' pension plan. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the general employees' pension plan in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280.

(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the plan showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested in such securities or property wherever situated and whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but not limited to stocks, common or preferred, bonds, other evidences of indebtedness or ownership, and mutual funds, but there shall be no direct investment in the following:

At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
n.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually

(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of two and seven-tenths (2.7) percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(c)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. 2004-02, § 1, 3-16-04; Ord. No. 2009-02, § 1, 3-3-09) 
Sec. 15-96. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age sixty-two (62) and the completion of five (5) years of credited service. Each member shall become one hundred (100) percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime and ceasing upon death. The monthly retirement benefit shall be equal to two (2) percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of five (5) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence at age sixty-two (62) and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subparagraph (d)(1) above, and is actuarially reduced from the amount to which he would have been entitled had he retired at age sixty-two (62). 
(e)  Review of retiree benefits. The city council shall, every three (3) years, commencing October 1, 2009, review the status of all service retirees and beneficiaries who are receiving payments from the system for the purpose of considering an ad hoc increase in benefits for all such retirees. In determining the adjustment, if any, the city council shall consider the actuarial soundness of the system as set forth in the most recent actuarial valuation, the prevailing rate of inflation as reflected in the Consumer Price Index, and the recommendations of the board. For purposes of its recommendation regarding the granting of ad hoc cost-of-living increases, and in consideration of the position of the state division of retirement, the board shall make a recommendation for an increase only if the net actuarial gains experienced since the most recent adjustment are sufficient to fully purchase the value of the additional benefits. The calculation of net actuarial gains and losses shall be computed by the board's actuary using generally accepted actuarial principles, and the cost method employed in the actuarial valuation of the fund, and shall be in compliance with F.S. § 112.61. 
(f)  Cost-of-living adjustment. Effective on June 1, 2006, the monthly benefit being received by all retirees, joint pensioners or beneficiaries who were receiving a benefit on October 1, 2005 shall be increased by three (3) percent for each full year that the retiree has been retired as of that date or for each full year that the retiree would have been retired as of that date in the case of a joint pensioner or beneficiary. This is a one-time increase in these benefits. 
(g)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city.

If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions, and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. 2004-02, § 1, 3-16-04; Ord. No. 2009-02, § 1, 3-3-09) 
Sec. 15-99. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options:

(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  The member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above. 
b.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per (1), (2) or (3) above.

(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of the member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 15-99. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 15-97. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 15-99. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 15-96(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

Sec. 15-100. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder.

Sec. 15-102. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid.

(Ord. 2004-02, § 1, 3-16-04) 
Sec. 15-103. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of code section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in treasury regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five (5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one-half (5.5) percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the thirty-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under treasury regulation section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in revenue ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of revenue ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-97. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten (10) years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten (10) percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 15-97. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 15-103, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 15-103 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior plan year, and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 15-103 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 15-113 and 15-115, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a, the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b, the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b, may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the code section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 22 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulations section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under chapter 1223, title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b). 
(Ord. 2004-02, § 1, 3-16-04; Ord. No. 2009-02, § 1, 3-3-09; Ord. No. 2013-06, § 2, 6-18-13; Ord. No. 2017-02, § 6, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 15-104. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 2(b)(2)a, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 15-96, 15-97, 15-98, or 15-99 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 15-97) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(G). and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9)(G) and treasury regulation section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the treasury regulations.

Sec. 15-105. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Sec. 15-106. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(c)  The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system as of the date of repeal of this article, or if contributions to the system are discontinued with the date of such discontinuation being determined by the board: 
(1)  Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retiree receiving a retirement benefit hereunder on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a retired or disabled (but since deceased) member, and each member who has, by such date, become eligible for normal retirement but has not yet retired, an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit, provided that, if such asset value be less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
(2)  If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionment under subparagraph (1), apportionment shall next be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is vested and who is not entitled to an apportionment under subparagraph (1), in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, and each vested former member then entitled to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments, in the amount required to provide said actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(3)  If there be any asset value after the apportionments under subparagraphs (1) and (2), apportionment shall be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is not entitled to an apportionment under subparagraphs (1) and (2) in the amount equal to member's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder such latter amount shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(4)  If there be any asset value remaining after the apportionments under subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3), apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member included in subparagraph (3), to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of the non-vested accrued normal retirement benefit, less the amount apportioned in subparagraph (3), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such amounts shall be reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(5)  In the event that there be asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in subparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4), such excess shall be returned to the city. 
The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one (1) sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(d)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city.

(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

Sec. 15-111. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distribution. 
(a)  Rollover distribution. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401 (a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a Member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00.), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. 2004-02, § 1, 3-16-04; Ord. No. 2006-13, § 7, 5-16-06; Ord. No. 2009-02, § 1, 3-3-09) 
Sec. 15-112. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a general employee after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed select one of the following options: 
(1)  The retiree may elect to discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon initial retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation and credited service as of the date of the subsequent retirement (based only on the subsequent employment period). The amount of any death benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit; or 
(2)  The retiree may continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned and not be an active member of the system. If this option is selected, the subsequent employment period shall have no effect upon average final compensation, years of credited service or retirement benefits. Regardless of any other provision of this system, any reemployed retiree electing to continue to receive retirement benefits shall not be reinstated as an active member of the system. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned during any subsequent employment period. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit.

(2)  Lot width. The width of a lot is its mean width measured at right angles to its depth. 
(3)  Lot depth. The depth of a lot is the average depth measured in the mean direction of the side lines from the street line to the rear line, and the rear line shall be deemed to be not farther back than a line drawn parallel with the street line entirely on the lot, and not less than ten feet long. 
(Ord. of 3-4-58, § 3) 
Sec. 18-2. - Approval and recording of plats required. 
    No real property within the city shall be divided and offered for sale by reference to a plat thereof to be filed in the public land records until said plat has been considered by the planning and zoning board, the city manager and approved by city council; provided, however, the procedures and standards set forth in this chapter shall not apply to the exceptions enumerated in section 18-1, subsection (1); nor shall a plat be recorded without first submitting a preliminary plat for review by the planning and zoning board and without obtaining from the council approval of the final plat.

A subdivider or property owner shall submit a copy of a preliminary plat of his proposed subdivision, prepared in accordance with the requirements of sections 18-5 and 18-6 to the city manager at least five days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the planning and zoning board. Before acting to grant preliminary approval or to reject the proposed subdivision, the planning and zoning board shall receive reports from the building inspector and the city manager certifying compliance with, or noting deviations from, the requirements of this chapter and commenting on any other items which bear upon the public interest in the proposed subdivision. After preliminary approval has been granted by the planning and zoning board, the final plat of the subdivision shall be prepared and submitted for final approval within one year from the date of the preliminary approval. No improvements shall be made in the subdivision other than grading or filling until the preliminary plat has been approved and detailed plans for such improvements have been approved by the city manager. 
(b)  Final plat approved by council. The owner or subdivider shall submit three copies of the final plat prepared in accordance with the conditions of the preliminary approval and requirements of section 18-7 to the city manager at least five days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the planning and zoning board.

(Ord. of 3-4-58, § 4) 
Sec. 18-4. - Installation of improvements and utilities for plats within the city.

The city manager may vary these requirements when they relate to streets on the periphery of a subdivision. Street paving or other improvements to be installed within proposed public rights-of-way and all sub-surface drains regardless of location shall be subject to prior approval of the city manager. Cost for such installations shall be paid for by the subdivider when such improvements are installed. The city manager may also require the subdivider to install or guarantee the installation of crosswalks and of sidewalks on any street where the need for sidewalks is set forth in the minutes of a planning and zoning board meeting and two-thirds of the members of such board, present and voting, recommend that sidewalks be constructed along a street and/or where the city manager deems sidewalks or crosswalks necessary. 
(b)  Storm drainage. If special drainage facilities to carry storm water from a subdivision or several subdivisions are necessary, these facilities shall be built in compliance with specifications to be provided by the city and paid for by the subdividers, within the boundaries of the property involved, and shall connect with the city's storm facilities in such reasonable manner as the city manager shall require. 
(c)  Sewer service. When there is an adequate public sanitary sewer system having sufficient capacity available at the periphery of a subdivision, the subdivider shall extend such sewer service so as to provide service to each lot in the subdivision. 
(d)  Alternative methods of guaranteeing improvements. Where the improvements required in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section above have not been completed prior to the submission of the plat for final approval, the approval of said plat shall be subject to one of the following alternatives if required by the council: 
(1)  The owner or owners filing with the city a performance or surety bond in an amount to be determined by the city manager with sureties satisfactory to the city, guaranteeing the grading and paving of the streets and the installation of curb and gutter, storm drains, sidewalks, street lights, and water and sewer lines where same are required within a specified time. 
(2)  The deposit or the placing in escrow of cash or a certified check with the City, in an amount to be determined by the city manager, to cover the cost of the improvements. The city manager may release portions of this security deposit as work progresses. 
(3)  The owner entering into an agreement with the city, guaranteeing the completion of the required work; said agreement to be binding on subsequent purchasers of the property and to be recorded at the option of the city. The agreement shall permit progressive development by sections and shall provide that satisfactory security be furnished the city, guaranteeing the completion of the necessary improvements before each section is developed. 
(Ord. of 3-4-58, § 5) 
Sec. 18-5. - General requirements and minimum standards of design. 
    All proposed subdivisions shall be in conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighboring area and shall conform substantially to the plans of the planning and zoning board. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a thoroughfare, boulevard or parkway, so designated by the council, such part of such proposed public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the width recommended by the planning and zoning board and approved by the council. 
(1)  Relation of proposed streets to adjoining street system. Any proposed street system shall extend existing streets or projects at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. Where, in the opinion of the planning and zoning board, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. The center line of continuation of streets must be in alignment with or be offset by the width of the larger right-of-way plus at least twenty feet. 
(2)  Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the name of existing streets, regardless of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place or court. 
(3)  Minimum street widths. The minimum width of proposed streets, roads and alleys, measured from lot line to lot line shall be: 
Feet 
Major arterial streets which serve or may serve heavy local traffic and a major state or Federal highway ..... 120 
Major arterial streets which now serve or may serve heavy traffic in the metropolitan area ..... 100 
Arterial streets connecting important divisions of the metropolitan area ..... 80 
Local service streets which have, or may have in the future, a continuous alignment more than one mile in length and all local feeder streets ..... 60 
All other local service streets ..... 50 
Alleys in commercial or industrial areas ..... 24 
Alleys in residential areas ..... 20 
(4)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets seventy feet or more in width, the center line radius or curvature shall be not less than three hundred feet; on other streets, not less than one hundred feet. 
(5)  Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty degrees. On any arterial street within one hundred fifty feet of any intersection with another arterial street designated by the planning and zoning board, the minimum right-of-way width as set forth in subsection (3) shall be increased by at least twenty percent. On any minor street within one hundred feet of any intersection with an arterial street, the minimum right-of-way width shall be seventy feet. These increased right-of-way lines shall be joined to the lesser right-of-way lines by a gradual curve. 
(6)  Additional right-of-way on corners. There shall be a minimum radius at the property line of twenty feet at all intersections, or a diagonal cut-off at least twenty feet back along each lot line from the point of intersection of the corner. The planning and zoning board may require a greater radius or diagonal cut-off at the intersection of any street with an arterial street. 
(7)  Deadend streets. In general, streets designed to have one end permanently closed (cul-de-sac) shall be avoided unless it is clear that a through street is not desirable for the street system in the area. Where such streets are used, they shall terminate in a circular area of public right-of-way having a minimum property line radius of fifty feet, and a minimum outside curb radius of forty feet. 
(8)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to the rear of lots to be used for commercial and industrial purposes and may be provided in residential blocks. 
(9)  Block width. Blocks, except waterfront blocks, shall be at least wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, plus width of alley as required. 
(10)  Lot dimensions. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development contemplated, and shall conform to the following: 
(a)  Every lot or parcel of land shall abut a public street. 
(b)  Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(c)  Every lot shall have a minimum mean lot width of sixty feet, except that every corner lot shall have a minimum mean lot width of sixty-five feet, but in no case shall the frontage upon a public street be reduced below forty feet. 
(d)  Every lot shall have a depth no greater than two and one-half times the mean width, and no less than ninety feet. 
(e)  Every one and one-half lots shall have a minimum lot area of 6,000 square feet. 
(f)  On plats within the force and effect of any current zoning ordinance, the minimum lot area shall in no case be less than that required by such zoning ordinance. 
(11)  Utility easements. To provide for public service poles, conduits, storm drains, sewers or water lines, an easement not less than fifteen feet wide, seven and one-half feet on each side of the common rear lot line and in other locations where necessary, shall be provided. No building or other obstruction shall be erected and no trees or shrubbery shall be planted on an easement required under this chapter other than fences and hedges of a type approved by the city manager, and such fences and hedges shall be cleared away by the property owner whenever necessary in the opinion of the city manager. 
(12)  Variances. Where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, strict adherence to the provisions of the regulations in this section would cause an unnecessary hardship, the planning and zoning board may recommend and the council authorize a variance, if such variance can be made without destroying the intent of this chapter. Any variance thus authorized is required to be entered in writing in the minutes of the planning and zoning board and of the council and the reasoning on which the departure was justified shall be set forth.

For purposes of this section "abandoning use" shall mean removing the previously permitted recreational vehicle from the owner's property for the aforementioned time period. 
(7)  Owner(s) of recreational vehicles not conforming to the requirements of section 21-4(1) and who have not applied for a special exemption by January 2, 2014, shall no longer be eligible and will be considered in violation of this code and subject to enforcement procedures.

It is intended that the regulations and requirements applying to a PUD zoning district shall be sufficiently flexible in structure so as to encourage creative and imaginative design in planning and development. Where there are conflicts between the requirements set forth herein for a PUD zoning district and the general provisions of this chapter or other applicable codes of the Codes of the City of Gulfport, the requirements herein shall govern; provided, however, that development within a PUD zoning district shall not exceed standards within said other applicable codes.

Uses permitted within a particular PUD zoning district shall be only those uses deemed by the city council to be fully compatible with each other, with the context of the proposed development as a whole and with the zoning and land use patterns of surrounding areas. The type, general location, and extent of all proposed uses shall be clearly designated as part of the general concept plan, and approval of said uses or types of uses as part of a rezoning amendment shall constitute the permitted land use requirements of a particular PUD zoning district to the same extent and degree as were said permitted uses specifically included in the context of this chapter.

The density/intensity of use shall not exceed the requirements of the land use plan category assigned to the subject property. 
(f)  Minimum green space requirement. A minimum of twenty (20) percent of total site area, less any area(s) devoted exclusively to nonresidential uses, shall be devoted to common open space and recreation areas. Said areas shall be exclusive of areas required for streets, off-street parking, setbacks at the periphery of the development, and necessary open spaces between buildings and other uses. 
(g)  Maximum building coverage. The maximum combined area of building coverage by all residential, community, and recreation structures shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of the gross site area, excluding any portion of the site devoted exclusively to nonresidential uses; provided, however, that said maximum building coverage shall be forty (40) percent of the gross site area, excluding any portion devoted exclusively to nonresidential uses, where covered parking is included as an integral part of the residential structures. Where residential and nonresidential uses are combined within a single structure, the site area of said structure shall be included as part of the gross site area for purposes of calculating residential land coverage. Maximum building coverage for structures devoted to nonresidential usage shall be thirty (30) percent of that portion of the gross site area devoted to said nonresidential usage. 
(h)  Maximum building height. The maximum height of structures within a PUD district shall be as specifically established by the city council in its approval action. 
(i)  Yard requirements and buffering. 
(1)  Where the PUD district adjoins any residential district, all portions of a structure shall be set back a distance equal to its total height from any private property within said residential district or a distance equal to one-half its height from any property line adjoining a street, right-of-way, or waterway; provided, that in no case shall said setback distance be less than thirty-five (35) feet. 
(2)  Buffering shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of section 22-6.07 as specifically required by the city council in its approval action. 
(j)  Conformance with city and countywide future land use plan. All development within this zoning district shall be in conformance with the city and countywide future land use plans and the standards for use, location, density, intensity and other standards contained therein, except where standards set by this district are more restrictive. No density or intensity averaging shall be permitted among separate land use categories. 
(k)  Procedures on PUD amendments. The following steps shall be utilized in the application, review, and approval of a PUD rezoning petition: 
(1)  Preapplication conference(s). The applicant or his authorized representative(s) shall confer with the chief building official and such other city official as may be requested to participate by the chief building official prior to filing an application for a change of zone to the PUD district.

A general concept plan at appropriate scale showing the types, general grouping and massing arrangement of all proposed buildings; the uses or types of uses intended for each general grouping of buildings; the approximate total floor area and residential floor area of each general building grouping and of the total development; the total number of dwelling units proposed for each general building grouping and for the total development; the approximate location of all proposed streets, driveways, and parking and service areas (indicating number of parking spaces to be provided); and the location and character of proposed open spaces and recreation areas. 
f.  A schematic traffic flow plan showing by approximate location the estimated volumes of peak-hour vehicular traffic movement throughout the property, and indicating its point(s) of access to egress from the property. (This requirement may be waived by the chief building official when it is determined that the proposed development is of such limited size so as to create no undue volumes of vehicular traffic movement.) 
g.  A supportive report indicating the degree of compliance of the proposal with the city's comprehensive plan and including all other data, descriptions, or illustrative material necessary to supplement the required graphic materials. Any prepared market analysis or feasibility study shall be submitted as part of the supportive material. If applicable, a description of the proposed staging plan shall also be submitted describing the general geographic area and development components proposed for each project stage, and setting forth anticipated starting and completion date for each project stage. 
(3)  Review by planning and zoning board. All application materials shall be submitted to the planning and zoning board for its review. The planning and zoning board may request the applicant to submit additional materials or data deemed reasonably necessary to its review of the proposed material. Following its review, the planning and zoning board shall submit within sixty (60) days its recommendations upon the proposed rezoning to the city council; including any additional requirements deemed necessary to ensure a proper development of the project. 
(4)  Action by city council. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning board, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the petition in accordance with the requirements set forth in this chapter. Following the hearing, the city council shall: 
a.  Grant the amendment as proposed; 
b.  Grant with specific modifications agreed to by the petitioner; or 
c.  Deny the amendment. 
Such action shall include the plan and all instruments related thereto in the form and degree of completion reached at the time of announcement of the public hearing before the city council. If the city council grants the amendment, the development shall be in accordance therewith and with general PUD requirements existing at the time of amendment except as such requirements are modified in their application in the amending action. Said development shall conform to any order of priority or time limitations established by the city council in amendment as to beginning and completion of the development as a whole of specified stages. Before development may proceed, copies of any prospectus, letter of approval, or other assurance as may be reasonably required shall have been received by the city. If the city council grants the amendment, the subject property shall be designated PUD on the official zoning map. 
(5)  Action following PUD rezoning. Following PUD rezoning, no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued in the district until and unless final plans and reports have been submitted in such detail as necessary for determination of compliance with PUD regulations and requirements of other applicable city regulations or ordinances, and have been approved by the appropriate officer or agency as complying with all said regulations, requirements, and ordinances as applying generally at the time of the amendment or as modified by the city council in its amending actions. The applicant shall confer with the chief building official prior to final plan submission for any stage or project to determine the specific submission requirements for the particular stage or project involved. With respect to the general regulations and requirements of the PUD zoning district, as originally set forth or as modified by the city council in its rezoning action, the compliance therewith of final plans shall be reported in writing to the city council by the planning and zoning board, said report to be submitted within sixty (60) days following the initiation of review by the board. All such final plans shall be for the development as a whole or for stages and priorities approved by the city council in its rezoning action. No structure or use other than as indicated in approved final plans or reports shall be permitted. Upon its finding that final plan for any stage or project complies with all regulations and requirements of the PUD zoning district, the city council shall certify said finding by official action. 
(6)  Changes in development plans. Modification of the concept development plan may be approved by the city council upon a finding by said body that said modification provides equivalent amenities to those set forth in the concept plan and reports approved by the city council and does not result in an overall increase in intensity of land use, density floor area, or ground coverage. Any proposed modification shall first have been reviewed by the planning and zoning board and reported thereon the city council within sixty (60) days following initiation of said review. The city council may also approve changes in the proposed staging of a development upon a finding that all public or private facilities and utilities required to service the proposed development stage may be properly provided and maintained in accordance with the revised construction schedule. 
(7)  Expiration of time limits of PUD development. If development actions required in the rezoning amendment are not taken within any time limits set by the city council in its rezoning action, the planning and zoning board shall review the circumstances and recommend to the city council that: 
a.  PUD zoning for the entire area be continued with revised time limits, 
b.  PUD zoning be continued for part of the area with revised time limits, and the remainder be rezoned to appropriate classifications, or 
c.  The entire area be rezoned from PUD to an appropriate classification. 
Said recommendation shall include proposals for appropriate action in respect to any legal instruments involved in the case. 
(Ord. No. 93-14, § 5, 10-5-93) 
Sec. 22-5.15. - COD (conservation overlay) zoning district. 
(a)  Purpose. The city has a unique character that has been created over years of development. The area that this section is intended to cover will be referred to as the conservation overlay district. Development of this area started in the early 1900's and continues to be a popular residential area. The original predominant housing types were single-story bungalow and cottage styles, many of which were built as vacation homes. These homes were small and have been built onto throughout the years. Currently, there are a number of housing types that have created an eclectic mix of styles that have been remodeled and added to by a diversity of property owners throughout the years. The eclectic nature of the conservation overlay district, created by a diversity of housing styles built at a human scale is the very thing that residents are concerned about protecting. 
New development pressures and flood plain regulations have created a pattern of development that is inconsistent with the character of these neighborhoods. While this area of the city has attracted new residents because of the character, their desire to build larger homes, devoid of any architectural features or landscaping, next to smaller single story homes is actually leading to the demise of the very thing that attracts new residents to the conservation overlay district. 
The desire to build homes with modern interior layouts has led to the use of readily available tract home construction plans. When built next to each other, using the same architectural style, same general footprint and with little to no landscaping, these designs give the appearance of a new subdivision as opposed to complementing the scale, diversity and maturity of the surrounding neighborhood. Two-story development can create an even greater sense of incompatibility if the design does not include attention to massing or scale. This becomes problematic, particularly with redevelopment of existing structures on smaller lots. Many times the only cost effective way to build an addition is to build up. Flood regulations require elevating structures, which in turn creates a home that is often out of scale with surrounding homes. 
The citizenry of the area have voiced their concerns about incompatibility issues with new residential development. Based upon this urging, the city council instructed staff to develop a set of architectural standards that would still encourage redevelopment of the conservation overlay district while protecting the character of this unique part of the city. That character, being defined in part by homes built on a human scale, has created the small town atmosphere found in this area. Human scale is the relationship or proportion between the human form and a structure. Gulfport is in fact a small town and the preservation of that character in the older part of the city is of paramount importance not only to the homeowners within the conservation overlay district, but to the city as a whole. 
These guidelines are not intended to limit creativity, rather they are established to act as a tool for site-specific design of new and redeveloped structures that recognize and enhance the character of the surrounding neighborhood. The shape of a house, its arrangement of doors and windows, its roof style, its architectural style all make up the character of a house and contribute to the collective appearance of the neighborhood. 
(b)  Applicability. The COD (conservation overlay) zoning district regulations shall apply to all property within the district in addition to any other zoning district regulations applicable to said property. These regulations shall apply to all new single-family and multi-family development and redevelopment or remodeling of existing single-family and multi-family development within the district, as set forth herein. 
(c)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to these zoning district regulations: 
    Architectural features: Features that enhance the residential or human/pedestrian scale. Examples of such architectural features are bay windows, dormers, open porches and entryways, arbors and trellises, garden walls, and window and door awnings; 
    Articulation: The giving of emphasis to architectural elements (like windows, balconies, entries, etc.) that create a complementary pattern or rhythm, dividing large buildings into smaller, identifiable pieces. Articulation also includes the use of projections and recesses that divide large facades into human-scaled proportions that reflect single-family dwellings nearby and avoid repetitive, monotonous, undifferentiated wall planes; 
    Block front: The street front area on both sides of the street extending a full block in either direction from the end of the block the subject property is located on; 
    Canopy tree: Any species of tree that when mature provides a shade canopy, including oak trees and pine trees. Such species shall be approved trees as identified in article XX of this chapter; 
    Differentiation: Showing a difference in appearance. See also "articulation;" 
    Dormer: A projection from a sloping roof that contains a window; 
    Facade: The front of the building facing or oriented toward the street or roadway, excluding alleyways; 
    Human scale: The proportional relationship of a particular building structure, or streetscape element to the human form and function. Human scale relates the size and/or height of a structure to the height and mass of a pedestrian traveling along the sidewalk or street adjacent to that structure; 
Human Scale 
These diagrams help illustrate the concept of human or pedestrian scale. The diagram to the left shows no human scale in relation to the building. The diagram to the right shows human scale features such as columns, awnings, and entryways that bring the same building into relationship with pedestrians. 
    Primary entrance: The primary or principle pedestrian entrance of all buildings (except outbuildings). The primary entrance is the entrance designed for access by pedestrians from the sidewalk, or street if a sidewalk is not present. This is the principle architectural entrance even though day-to-day residential access may be via a secondary entrance associated with a garage, driveway or other vehicular use area; 
    Primary street front: The street or roadway to which the home is oriented; 
    Scale: The apparent relationship between two entities, such as the relationship of a building's height to human height, the relationship between different building's heights, or the relationship between the size of an addition and the building to which it is attached; 
    Secondary street front: On a lot with multiple street fronts the secondary street front is the street or roadway to which the home is not oriented; 
    Street tree: A tree or group of trees that line the edge of a street or roadway. This would include trees in the right-of-way; 
    Understory vegetation: Low to the ground vegetation such as shrubs and similar plants. This definition does not include sod, which is considered ground cover. 
(d)  Standards. The following standards shall be applied to the design and construction of structures within the COD (conservation overlay) zoning district: 
(1)  Existing single and multi-family structures. It is the existing single-family structures that for the most part have created the uniqueness and character of this area. For this reason care should be taken to maintain that character when remodeling and redeveloping these homes. The application of these standards ensures that an upgrade to an existing structure does not detract from the overall appearance and scale of the surrounding neighborhood, while still allowing for redevelopment of the older housing stock and reinvestment into these neighborhoods. 
All existing single and multi-family structures in the district shall be constructed in accordance with the following regulations: 
a.  The remodeling of facades on existing structures shall at a minimum match the design elements of the existing facade. These elements include, but are not limited, to window size and spacing, roof pitch and overhang of eaves of the existing structure. For example, in enclosing an existing garage for extra living space, the facade of the new enclosure would have to provide a number of openings, in the form of doors and/or windows of a size and spacing consistent with those of the existing facade. If however, the garage enclosure is part of an entirely new facade, the new facade elements shall be as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. 
When an existing single- or multi-family structure erects a second story or a new garage, the elements for new single- and multi-family structures shall be as set forth in subsection (2) of this section as it concerns multi-story structures and garages. 
(2)  New single and multi-family structures. All newly constructed single- and multi-family structures in the district shall be constructed in accordance with the following regulations: 
a.  Facade. The facade of a building is the front of the building facing or oriented toward the street or roadway, excluding alleyways. The primary street front in the case of lots with multiple fronts is the street front that the pedestrian entryway is oriented and that which the majority of houses are oriented towards. The secondary street front is the front that is not designed for primary pedestrian access from the street or sidewalk. Garages may sometimes be located on either primary or secondary street fronts, however the garage is not considered as a pedestrian entryway. 

Facades 
New houses without front porches do not contribute to the richness and warmth of the block. 
All facades shall be constructed as follows: 
1.  Finish: All facades shall have a finish treatment such as siding, stucco or similar aesthetic wall treatment. Simply painting an unfinished exterior, like concrete block, is not sufficient to meet this standard. The base material shall have an aesthetic finish. 
2.  Minimum features: A facade, whether primary or secondary, shall exhibit at least two (2) of following features: 
A.  Articulation; 
B.  Awnings or shutters; or 
C.  Porches and/or entryway features. 
3.  Windows: The facade shall have at least one window every twenty (20) feet per floor. The size of any facade window, including the frame, shall be a minimum of nine (9) square feet. 
b.  Primary entrance orientation. The primary entrance is the entrance designed for access by pedestrians from the sidewalk or street if a sidewalk is not present. This is the principle architectural entrance even though day-to-day residential access may be via a secondary entrance associated with a garage, driveway or other vehicular use area. The entryway is an important feature for maintenance of neighborhood characteristics. 

Porches 
Front porches are fundamental characteristics of some architectural styles and always add a sense of presence and welcome The house without an entry feature lacks the architectural interest and sense of welcome of the other houses  
All primary entrances shall be constructed as follows: 
The principle entrance of all buildings, except outbuildings such as sheds or garages, shall be oriented directly toward the primary street front. 
c.  Garages. The location, size, position and appearance of a garage can have a great effect on the appearance of a home and should be designed with care. Garages were not prominent features of the earlier housing stock found within the conservation overlay district and should not dominate new housing or redevelopment of existing housing. 

Garage 
This illustrates the use of a recessed garage with a prominent entryway/porch feature 
Garages shall be constructed as follows: 
The garage shall not be the prominent feature of the front facade. A garage shall be staggered from adjacent garages and shall not be placed beside an existing garage on an adjacent property, unless both adjoining and adjacent properties have garages located directly adjacent to the subject property. At least 2 of the following features shall be used in designing new garages, unless the garage is placed facing the secondary street front on corner lots, or the garage is placed toward the rear of the property facing an alleyway: 
1.  Articulation of the facade to set the garage back from the rest of the facade; 
2.  Use of a side load garage with window openings as per the facade requirements; 
3.  No more than one-half (1/2) of the facade shall be used for a garage; and 
4.  A prominent entryway with open porch shall be used that spans one-half (1/2) of the facade. 

Garage Width 
Garage no more than half the width of the house. 
d.  Landscaping. Landscaping has a dramatic affect on the appearance of a home and in making new homes appear more mature and in keeping with the existing neighborhood character. The maintenance of existing tree canopies and street trees creates continuity between established neighborhood development and new infill development. Understory (low to the ground) and foundation plantings mitigate the severity of new construction by melding nature with urbanization. A newly completed home, without landscaping, often leads to the feeling that it does not "fit in" with the surrounding neighborhood. A well thought out landscape plan can make that same home look like it was built years ago. 
The following landscaping shall be required: 
1.  General: A minimum landscaped area of twenty (20) square feet of landscaping per one thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area shall be required. This is inclusive of any green space or permeable surface regulations set forth in the applicable zoning district. 
2.  Street trees: When street trees are present on the block, at least one tree per 50 linear feet shall be planted along the street front, which may be in the right-of-way. The minimum requirement for street trees shall be four (4) inches in diameter, as measured at breast height, with a minimum height of eight (8) feet. The species shall be of the same type as other street trees found along the block face. If there is a mature existing street tree canopy on the property meeting the foregoing requirements, no additional street trees shall be required. Alternative species may be used if overhead utility lines make replication of the existing tree canopy impractical, and the spacing requirement shall be adjusted to meet the intent of providing a canopy cover when said trees mature. 
3.  Canopy trees: There shall be a minimum of two (2) canopy trees per site. At least one (1) of these trees shall be placed within the front yard. Existing canopy trees and required street trees (as long as they are canopy trees) may be applied toward this minimum. The minimum size shall be four (4) inches in diameter, as measured at breast height, with a minimum height of eight (8) feet. Adjustments to the required location of canopy trees may be made to accommodate an existing tree canopy. 
4.  Existing trees: Encroachments of new structures into the required side and rear yard setbacks to accommodate existing mature canopy trees are allowed without a variance provided such encroachments do not project by more than twenty-five (25) percent of the required setback. 
5.  Foundation plantings: All facades shall include foundation plantings along the periphery of the facade, excluding driveway areas. There shall be a minimum planting area of three (3) feet in width landscaped with understory vegetative materials. Foundation plantings may be counted toward the landscape requirements set forth elsewhere in this section. 
e.  Multi-story structures. Single-story houses dominate the single-family homes found within the conservation district. With the trend toward larger homes, multi-story development and redevelopment is becoming popular in an effort to maximize the useable area of small lots. Floodplain regulations require elevation of structures above a defined flood elevation. Many people elect to build above the required flood elevation to take advantage of the large space left under the structure for garage and storage areas. 
This type of larger scale development can dwarf adjacent single story development and disturb the character of an area simply due to the scale and bulk of the new or remodeled home. Attention to massing and scale can help to offset these disturbances and even be used to create the uniqueness that has lead to the creation of the neighborhood character. 
Scale 
House No. 3 appears out of scale because its form is too simple. 
Revised Scale 
The revised design of House No. 3 became compatible with its neighbors by stepping back the second story and providing variation in the roof and building forms. 
The following regulations apply to structures having more than one (1) story, whether each story is for living or habitable area or not: 
1.  Facade variations: Repetitive, monotonous, undifferentiated wall planes shall not be permitted. Buildings shall be articulated with projections, recesses, covered entryways, porches, balconies, covered box or bay windows and/or similar features, dividing large facades into human scaled proportions. 

Good Example of providing human scale and compatibility with adjacent home through the use of dormers and maintaining a single roof eave line. 
Poor example - While this example does exhibit some standards the entryway is out of scale and there are too many roof pitches. 
2.  Second story differentiation: The second living or habitable story shall be differentiated from the ground floor, or first living floor in a home required to be elevated to meet FEMA related regulations, by utilizing the following features: 
A.  Setbacks. The second living or habitable story shall be set back from the side and front building lines of the ground floor, or first living floor in a home required to be elevated to meet FEMA related regulations, by no less than two (2) feet, and shall be centered over the ground floor when not prohibited by required engineering practices and/or FEMA related regulations. The foregoing setback shall not be required where the eave line of the roof, at the facade (or facades in the case of a lot with multiple fronts), is brought down to the ground floor eave line (see illustration below). Dormers shall not make up more than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the second floor facade width. The only projections allowed into the second story setback area are roof overhangs of no more than 18 inches. No cantilevering of a structure over the front or side of the ground floor shall be allowed. 

This illustration shows a two-story house with the eave line of the roof at the first floor level. Dormers are used on the second floor. 
This second story addition centered over the lower floor appears balanced. 
This second story is an example where engineering practices or regulations make it impractical to center the second story addition over the lower floor. 
This second story located only over garage appears out of balance. 
B.  Articulation of the second story. The second living or habitable story shall be articulated in a way that differs from the ground floor, or first living floor in a home required to be elevated to meet FEMA related regulations, through the use of projections, recesses, balconies, covered box or bay windows, awnings and/or similar features. 
f.  Roofs. Roof shape and type can be the most obvious element in defining the appearance of a house and a neighborhood. When designing a new home or an addition, it is important to consider the massing of roof forms and neighborhood roof patterns and compatibility. 

All roof elements should have the same slope. Roof elements with varied slopes result in a building that looks confused and unattractive.  
Roofs shall be constructed in accordance with the following: 
1.  Pitch: Roofs shall have a minimum pitch of 4:12. Mansard and flat roofs shall only be used on structural exposures that will not be seen from a street front, unless the flat roof or mansard is part of an architectural style that routinely uses this feature, such as Spanish and Mediterranean architectural styles. 
2.  Overhang: A minimum overhang of 12 inches shall be provided for roof eaves. A roof overhang may encroach into the required yard setbacks by a maximum of 18 inches. 
g.  Setback encroachments. Architectural features may extend into the required front and side yard setbacks by no more than 25 percent of the required yard setback, without a variance. Allowable encroachments extend only to the architectural feature(s). For purposes of this paragraph an open porch shall be an unenclosed area, which may have a pitched roof tied into the main structure. 

Open Porch 
  
h.  Adjacent homes. When homes built next to one another are similar in appearance with little to no differentiation they take on the appearance of a subdivision or tract home. This is not consistent with the character of the conservation district. While many of the homes may have been the same when they were originally built, time has changed their original appearance through remodeling efforts, maturing of landscaping and individualization of the properties by a multitude of different owners. Different techniques should be employed in new construction and redevelopment that give the appearance of individuality. 
Adjacent homes shall be constructed in accordance with the following: 
When permits for construction of two (2) or more adjacent homes are issued within two (2) years, each later issued permit shall only be issued if the home to be constructed thereunder has at least two (2) of the following, as it relates to the adjacent homes already permitted: 
1.  Difference in architectural style/type; 
2.  Difference in roof type (i.e. hip vs. gable); 
3.  Difference in facade profile; and 
4.  Difference in footprint orientation. 
(Ord. No. 2004-12, § 1, 12-1-04) 
Sec. 22-5.16. - 49th Street redevelopment master overlay district (49thMOD). 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the 49thMOD (49th Street redevelopment master overlay district) is to establish development standards which will enhance redevelopment opportunities within the district and implement the city's adopted 49th Street corridor community redevelopment plan, herein referred to as the redevelopment plan. The 49thMOD is intended to be consistent with the community redevelopment district (CRD) land use category of the Gulfport Comprehensive Plan. The district is intended to encourage and promote the revitalization of the 49th Street corridor community redevelopment plan area and to maintain the unique characteristics of the area. This is to be achieved by allowing a wide variety of mixed uses, preserving existing residential neighborhoods and establishing development regulations which will promote reinvestment in the district. 
(b)  Boundary. The 49thMOD follows the same boundaries as set forth in the redevelopment plan with the exclusion of areas with an institutional (I), public (P), or open space (OS) zoning district designation. The boundaries are generally as follows: 
Starting at the intersection of the Pinellas Trail and 49th Street South south to Gulfport Boulevard South; west to 51st Street South; north to 20th Avenue South; west to 55th Street South; north to 18th Avenue South; east to 52nd Street South; north to the Pinellas Trail; east to beginning. 

(c)  Applicability. The 49thMOD is comprised of three overlay districts: commercial/mixed use overlay district (CMUOD), live-work overlay district (LWOD) and the Tangerine Parkway overlay district (TPOD). The three overlay districts as they relate with the existing zoning districts are as follows:

The three (3) overlay districts augment but do not otherwise replace the existing zoning districts. The site development parameters provided herein supersede any other requirements contained elsewhere in this land development code. Where this section is silent regarding any such development parameters the user shall default back to the underlying zoning district. All parcels outside the area provided in this section are not affected by the contents herein. In addition, those parcels within the public (P), open space (OS) and institutional (I) zoning districts are also excluded from any of the regulations contained herein. 

(d)  Permitted principle uses and structures. Uses and structures permitted within the 49thMOD and associated density (units per acre), intensity (floor area ratio, impervious surface ratio), and building height standards shall be consistent with the text, illustrations and maps within in the redevelopment plan. The following shall be permitted uses and development standards applicable to each of the following areas of the 49thMOD: 
(1)  Commercial/mixed use overlay district (CMUOD) area. 
a.  CMUOD purpose. The purpose of the CMUOD is to establish development standards which will enhance redevelopment opportunities within the district and implement the city's adopted 49th Street corridor community redevelopment plan. The CMUOD is intended to be consistent with the community redevelopment district (CRD) land use category of the Gulfport comprehensive plan and the adopted 49th Street corridor community redevelopment area plan. The district is intended to encourage and promote the revitalization of the 49th Street corridor community redevelopment area by allowing for a mix of nonresidential and mixed-use uses consistent with the commercial character of the area, the street configuration and design, as well as its operational characteristics. 
b.  CMUOD boundary. The CMUOD generally includes those parcels directly along 49th Street South within the CG and CL-2 zoning districts. 

c.  CMUOD permitted principal uses and structures. The following uses and structures are permitted in addition to those uses and structures as otherwise permitted by the underlying zoning districts. 
1.  Creative industries (as defined in section 22-2.02, specific terms); and 
2.  Mixed-use (as defined in section 22-2.02, specific terms): All permitted uses as combined with residential uses. 
d.  CMUOD maximum building coverage. 
1.  For nonresidential developments within the commercial general (CG) zoning district refer to the commercial general (CG) future land use plan classification within the comprehensive plan. 
2.  For nonresidential developments within the commercial retail (CL-2) zoning district refer to the commercial limited (CL) future land use plan classification within the comprehensive plan. 
3.  All mixed-use uses, regardless of zoning district, shall not exceed a FAR of 0.75. 
e.  CMUOD minimum green space requirement: 
1.  For parcels within the commercial general (CG) zoning district refer to the commercial general (CG) future land use plan classification within the comprehensive plan.

(Ord. No. 85-8, § 2, 5-21-85) 
Sec. 22-6.06. - Off-street parking. 
(a)  General requirements. Each building, use, or structure instituted or erected after the effective date of this chapter shall be provided with off-street parking and service facilities in accordance with the provisions set forth herein for use of occupants, employees, visitors, or patrons. Such off-street parking and service facilities shall be maintained and continued as an accessory use as long as the principal use is continued. 
Where a building or use existed at the effective date of this chapter, said building may be modernized, altered, or repaired without providing additional off-street parking or service facilities, provided there is no increase in floor area or capacity and there is no change in use which results in the need for additional parking. 
Where a building or use which existed at the effective date of this chapter is enlarged in floor area, volume, capacity, or space occupied, off-street parking and service facilities shall be provided to meet the requirements for the total and combined floor area, volume, capacity, or space resulting from said enlargement. 
It shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any building, structure, or use regulated by this chapter to discontinue, change or dispense with or to cause the discontinuance of or reduction of the required parking and service facilities, other than through a corresponding discontinuance or reduction in size of building, structure, or use, without establishing alternative parking or service facilities which meet the requirements of this chapter. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation thereafter to utilize such building, structure, or use without providing the off-street parking and service facilities to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Design and use requirements. Wherever, in any zoning district, off-street facilities are required, as provided in subsection (c) hereof, for the parking of any and all types of vehicles, boats, or heavy construction equipment, whether such vehicles, boats or equipment are self-propelled or not, and wherever land is utilized for the parking of vehicles as the primary use of said land, such off-street facilities and land shall conform to the following design and use requirements: 
(1)  Each required parking space for standard size cars shall have a minimum width of nine (9) feet and a minimum length of eighteen (18) feet. Each parking space designated for compact cars shall have a minimum width of eight (8) feet and a minimum length of sixteen (16) feet. Compact car spaces shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the required number of off-street parking spaces and shall be clearly marked for compact cars only. 
(2)  All off-street facilities shall be designed so as to have adequate access to a public street or alley and, in the case of parking facilities, adequate access to interior maneuvering areas. Except for parking serving single-family residences, parking facilities shall be arranged so that no vehicle shall be required to back from such facilities directly onto public streets. Wherever vehicular entrances and exits are involved, the number, size, curbcuts, distance apart, and general design of any said entrances and exits shall comply with the established standards and requirements of the state department of transportation where a state or federal highway is affected. In the case of other streets and roadways, the design of said entrances and exits shall be as required by the city engineer or as otherwise approved by the city manager. In no case shall a variance be granted which would allow vehicles to be required to back from any commercial establishment onto a four-laned collector street. 
(3)  Where off-street parking is required, such parking areas shall be used for vehicular parking only with no sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind, and the required areas in the various zoning districts shall be in addition to the loading and service spaces normally required for the business or office served. 
(4)  Where off-street parking is required, such parking shall be provided on the same lot or premises with the business or office which is being serviced, or upon an adjacent lot. 
(5)  Within any commercial zoning district, no vehicular parking required by this chapter shall be provided or permitted within any public right-of-way. In addition, no parking shall be provided or permitted which creates a safety hazard upon adjacent streets or which obstructs visibility at intersections, driveways, or alleys within the applicable areas described in section 22-6.01(f). 
(6)  Within residential zoning districts, parking for a single-family or duplex dwelling may be permitted within a required front or rear yard. Parking for multi-family dwellings may be permitted within a required rear yard if properly screened from adjacent property, but shall not be permitted within a required front or side yard. 
(7)  Where artificial lighting is provided, it shall be designed and arranged so that no source of such lighting will be a visible nuisance to adjoining property used or zoned for a residential purpose. In addition, such lighting shall be designed and arranged so as to shield public streets and highways and all adjacent properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind. 
(8)  The provisions of subsection (b) shall apply to all new off-street parking or other vehicular use areas. At such time as existing off-street parking or other vehicular use areas are enlarged, expanded, or modified, such provisions shall apply to the previous existing areas as well as the new areas. 
(9)  When units or measurements determining the number of off-street parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any such fractional space equal to or greater than one-half shall require a full off-street parking space. 
(10)  In the case where two (2) or more uses occupy or are proposed to occupy a land parcel, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the same as the requirements of the individual uses computed separately, and off-street parking space for one (1) such use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking space for any other use. However, credit may be given by the chief building official for a portion of the required combined parking where it can be demonstrated that the peak parking demands for the individual uses involved occur at different time periods. 
(11)  Upon city council approval, the required parking may be reduced by up to ten (10) percent where necessary to protect existing trees as defined in Chapter 23.5 of this Code.

(d)  Determination of requirements involving multiple seating facilities. For uses having multiple seating facilities such as pews, booths, benches, and the like, the term "seat" shall be considered as comprising each twenty-four (24) linear inches of seating space, or major fraction thereof. 
(e)  Combined off-street parking. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent collective provision for, or joint use of, off-street parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses by two (2) or more owners or operators, provided that the total of such parking spaces when combined or used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirement for the several individual uses computed separately in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. However, credit may be given by the chief building official for a portion of the combined required parking where it can be demonstrated that the peak parking demands for the individual buildings or uses occur at different time periods and where a cooperative agreement satisfactory to the city is executed by the owners of all said buildings. 
(f)  Use of required off-street parking for another building or use. No part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use, unless the type of use indicates that the periods of usage will not overlap or be concurrent with each other, as determined and approved by the chief building official. 
(g)  Off-street loading and service facilities. Off-street loading and service facilities shall be provided in accordance with the following standards and specifications: 
(1)  On the same lot with every structure or use hereinafter erected or created, there shall be provided and maintained adequate space for loading and unloading of materials, goods or things and for delivery and shipping so that vehicles for the service may use this space without encroaching on or interfering with the public use of sidewalks, streets, and alleys by pedestrians and vehicles. 
(2)  Where any structure is enlarged or any use is extended so that the size of the resultant occupancy comes within the scope of this subsection (g), the full amount of off-street loading space shall be supplied and maintained for the structure or use in its enlarged or extended size. Where the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use requiring off-street loading space under this subsection, the full amount of off-street loading space shall be supplied and maintained to comply with this subsection. 
(3)  For the purposes of this subsection, an off-street loading space shall be an area at the grade level at least ten (10) feet wide, twenty-five (25) feet long, and having fourteen (14) feet of vertical clearance. Each off-street loading space shall be accessible from a public street or alley without crossing or entering any other required off-street loading space, and shall be arranged for convenient and safe ingress and egress by motor truck and/or trailer combinations. Such loading space shall be accessible from the interior of any building it is intended to serve.

Where there is any question as to the off-street loading requirements as determined by the chief building official, said requirements shall be determined and fixed by the planning and zoning board of appeals. 
(5)  No parking area or parking facilities shall be utilized for or be deemed to meet the requirements of this subsection for off-street loading facilities. 
(6)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the collective, joint, or combined provision of off-street loading facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses, provided that such off-street loading facilities are equal in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several buildings or uses and are so located and arranged as to be usable thereby. Where it can be demonstrated that the use demand for the individual buildings or uses will occur at different time periods, credit for a portion of the required facilities may be given by the chief building official upon the execution of a cooperative agreement by the parties involved, which agreement is satisfactory to the city. 
(7)  Plans for buildings or uses requiring off-street loading facilities under the provisions of this subsection shall clearly indicate the location, dimensions, and access of all such required off-street loading facilities.

(3)  No alley between commercial properties and off-street parking lot shall be vacated for the purpose of providing additional parking or access to the adjacent commercial property. 
(4)  Surfacing. 
a.  Permanent surface. Except as otherwise permitted in subsection (d)(2), all parking areas, vehicular accessways and driveways shall be improved with permanent all-weather material which is graded to drain storm water. 
b.  Parking areas that are not provided with the type of surface specified in subsection (d)(1) shall be graded and surfaced with suitable materials to provide a surface that is stable and will resist erosion. The perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by easily identifiable marking such as brick, stones, railroad ties, or other similar devices. Turf block or other grass parking surface consistent with the terms hereof may be utilized only in parking spaces, not on the aisles which give access to the spaces. 
(5)  Lighting shall be provided and shall be arranged and installed to deflect, shade and focus light away from adjacent properties. The height, type, spacing and degree of cutoff of a light standard may be further regulated by the building official in relation to specific site conditions or types of development. 
(6)  A six-foot opaque screen which may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation, shall be provided along the sides of such off-street parking areas adjacent to any residential or undeveloped property. Compliance of planted vegetative screens will be based on average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species. The screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year and shall be maintained in good condition. 
(7)  Each lot shall be subject to the following minimum setback requirements: 
a.  From a street right-of-way: Twenty-five (25) feet; 
b.  From a side property line: Six (6) feet; 
c.  From a rear property line: One (1) foot.

(11)  Except as herein modified, size and configuration of parking spaces, circulation and other design specifications shall be as required herein. Ingress and egress may be restricted to the commercial site. 
(i)  Drive-through facilities. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. Products of the automotive age, drive-through facilities have become a common amenity for a specific range of uses, including banks, pharmacies, and fast-food restaurants. A well designed drive-through on a parcel with adequate area can be convenient for motorists and have minimal impact upon the streetscape and pedestrians. Conversely, a poorly designed drive-through on a parcel of inadequate size can cause problems with traffic circulation and create areas that are hostile to the pedestrian. Moreover, drive-throughs have the potential to generate undesirable impacts for adjacent properties such as odors from vehicle exhaust and noise from engines, car stereos, and menu board speakers. The purpose and intent of this section is to establish appropriate standards which allow for the typical range of activities while ensuring public safety and mitigating the associated impacts. 
(2)  Stacking lanes and spaces. 
a.  Size. The minimum size of a stacking lane space shall be ten (10) feet in width and twenty (20) feet in length. Stacking spaces shall not be used to satisfy any of the off-street parking or loading requirements. 
b.  Location. Stacking lanes shall be located so that, when in use, they do not obstruct ingress/egress to the site, they do not obstruct access to required parking or loading spaces, and do not otherwise interfere with vehicle circulation on the site. No stacking space shall occupy any portion of a public right-of-way. Stacking lanes shall be separated from ingress/egress drive ways and parking access traffic lanes. 
c.  Pedestrian access. Stacking lanes shall be designed to minimize pedestrians' access crossing stacking lanes. Stacking lanes that obstruct the pathway between parking areas and entries into the building shall be designed with a pedestrian crossing that is delineated by landscaping, curbing, raised or decorative pavement, and signage. 
d.  Escape lanes. A separate and distinct on-site escape lane shall be provided to allow motorists to bypass the drive-through stacking and service lanes. Stacking and service lanes shall not impede traffic in escape lanes. The minimum width of an escape lane shall be twelve (12) feet. 
e.  Number of spaces. For restaurants a minimum of 10 stacking spaces per stacking lane shall be provided in the drive-through lane with a minimum length to accommodate seven (7) vehicles between the entrance to the stacking lane and the order station. For financial institutions and pharmacies, a minimum of four (4) stacking spaces shall be provided. 
(3)  Speaker box/order station. Speaker boxes shall be designed and located so they will not create a nuisance to adjacent residential properties. 
(4)  Hours of operation. When the drive-through facility abuts a residential use, drive-through services shall be prohibited between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. weekdays and between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. This prohibition shall apply to any drive-through operating after the enactment date of the enabling ordinance. Any drive-through that was legally operating during the prohibited hours on the enactment date of the enabling ordinance, and ceases such operation for any period of time shall, thereafter, comply with this requirement at drive-through uses are prohibited during certain hours. 
(5)  Buffering. Drive-through accessory uses on properties adjacent to residential uses shall meet the buffering requirements set forth in section 22-6.07 of the zoning code. More stringent requirements may be imposed based on the proximity, orientation and/or use of drive-through amenities. 
(6)  Stacking studies. Depending on the site specific issues or the adjacent roadway facility, city staff may require the property owner to perform a stacking study even if the minimum vehicle stacking regulations are met. The study is to be conducted by a licensed professional traffic engineer at the cost of the property owner. A developer may, at its own expense, conduct a special study. Such studies and analysis will be conducted by licensed professional traffic engineers engaged by the developer and will be reviewed by traffic engineering professionals selected by the city at the developer's cost. 
(7)  Stacking after project is completed. If vehicles stack into public rights-of-way and/or adjacent properties at any time after the project is completed, the property owner will be required to make all necessary changes to the site to eliminate the said vehicle stacking.

Sec. 22-6.07. - Buffering requirements. 
    Where the rear or side property line of a lot developed or proposed to be developed for a nonresidential use lies within a residential district, or where the rear or side property line of a lot developed or proposed to be developed for a nonresidential use adjoins any residential district or a public street adjoining any residential district, suitable buffering in the form of a substantially opaque fence or wall shall be provided along the entire length of the property line (or adjacent setback line if applicable). Said buffering shall be at least six (6) feet in height and shall comply with all applicable fence regulations of the city. No buffering shall extend into an area required for sight line visibility in accordance with the provisions of section 22-6.01(f). A buffer shall be considered substantially opaque if it is constructed of solid materials that are designed to eliminate the passage of light through them, and which do, in fact, substantially eliminate the passage of light through them. The community redevelopment agency and city council may reduce or eliminate the buffering required hereunder, for any property, if such buffering is deemed unnecessary to protect the integrity and harmony of the residential properties located near the nonresidential development.

Sec. 22-6.11. - Special requirements for sidewalk cafes. 
(a)  Purpose. It is hereby found and declared that: 
(1)  Due to the lack of vacant land in the commercial and mixed-use zoning districts and the need to encourage redevelopment of existing structures, allowing outdoor seating on the public right-of-way (sidewalk cafes) in these districts is beneficial as it provides an opportunity for relaxation and food consumption; 
(2)  Sidewalk cafes encourage additional pedestrian traffic in pedestrian oriented areas and encourage more pedestrian oriented redevelopment projects; 
(3)  Sidewalk cafe standards are necessary to ensure a safe and pedestrian friendly environment in these areas and protect and promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city; and 
(4)  The issuance of a sidewalk cafe permit does not constitute a vacation by the city of its interest in the public right-of-way or any easements contained therein.

Editor's note- Exhibit A referenced in § 22-18.06 is not set out at length herein, however, said exhibit is on file and available for inspection at the office of the community development department. 
Sec. 22-18.07. - Proportionate fair share program. 
(a)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; and 
b.  The schedule of capital improvements in the capital improvement element (CIE) includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will mitigate the transportation impacts of the proposed development in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. 
(2)  The applicant may also choose to satisfy transportation concurrency by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of this subsection, but that is not contained in the CIE where the following apply: 
a.  Gulfport adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the CIE no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this subsection, the proposed improvement must be determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this subsection. Financial feasibility for this subsection means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten (10) years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities; 
b.  If the funds allocated for the CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required for the applicant to comply with the terms of this subsection, the city may enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
c.  The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the CIE; and 
d.  Any improvement project proposed to meet the applicant's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city, county and FDOT, as applicable. 
(b)  Proportionate fair share mitigation agreement. 
(1)  Upon notification that a proposed development project is subject to transportation concurrency regulations and is eligible to participate in the proportionate fair share program, the applicant shall be notified in writing of such during the site plan review process. 
(2)  If the applicant chooses to exercise this concurrency option, a meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), then the FDOT shall be notified and invited to participate in the meeting. 
(3)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrence of the FDOT. Agreements involving improvements to SIS facilities shall require approval by FDOT. 
(4)  After a mitigation project is identified and agreed upon by the city, the applicant and FDOT (if the project affects an SIS facility), a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement shall be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city. The final agreement shall become a part of the site plan submittal which shall be delivered to the appropriate parties for review. 
(c)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  The proportionate fair-share obligation shall be based upon the impact a development has on a transportation facility as determined by a traffic impact analysis that assesses the volume of traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  A facility shall be considered impacted when the net trips generated by the proposed development meets or exceeds five (5) percent of the facility's peak hour capacity. 
(3)  Should the impacted facility be operating at an LOS that meets the locally adopted LOS standard, it would not be eligible for the application of proportionate fair share provisions. 
(4)  Should the impacted facility be operating at a substandard LOS based on existing conditions or as a result of the impacts of a proposed development, the facility would be identified as eligible for proportionate fair share provisions and the applicant would be notified as such. 
(5)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(6)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(7)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180 (12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS. 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = S[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i;" and 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i." Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(8)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE or the MPO transportation improvement program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one (1) of the methods described below. 
a.  An analysis by the city, or its consultant, of construction costs that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually; or 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT Transportation Costs , as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(9)  The value of a proportionate fair share mitigation project proposed by the applicant and accepted by the city shall be determined using one (1) of the methods provided in this subsection. 
(10)  The city may also accept right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment. Credit for the dedication shall be based on fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
(d)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution shall be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city. 
(e)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall receive transportation concurrency approval or functional equivalent. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment. 
(3)  All proportionate fair share mitigation improvements authorized under this subsection shall be completed prior to issuance of a preliminary development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this subsection that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary rights-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement shall be completed prior to issuance of the final development permit or recording of the final plat. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. 
(7)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(f)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT transportation regional incentive program (TRIP). 
(2)  In the event a scheduled proportionate fair share improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor or planning sector that would mitigate the impacts of development. 
(3)  Where an impacted facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(4)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds said applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation, the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one (1) or more of the following methods: 
a.  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city; 
b.  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility; or 
c.  The city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant. 
(g)  Cross jurisdictional impacts. 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the city may enter into an agreement with one (1) or more adjacent local governments to address cross-jurisdictional impacts of development on multi-jurisdictional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this subsection to address the cross-jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(2)  A development application submitted subject to transportation concurrency requirements and meeting all of the criteria listed below shall be subject to this subsection. 
a.  All or part of the proposed development is located within an area or corridor designated by an adjacent local government where development projects are subject to transportation concurrency requirements in accordance with their respective land development codes. 
b.  If the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five (5) percent or more of the adopted peak hour LOS maximum service volume of a multi-jurisdictional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government ("impacted multi-jurisdictional facility"). 
c.  The impacted multi-jurisdictional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by the adjacent local government, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted multi-jurisdictional facility, the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
(4)  The adjacent local government shall have up to ninety (90) days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government shall provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180(16). Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this subsection, then the provisions of this subsection would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city. 
(5)  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the city, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied.

(c)  Before recommending issuance of a certificate of concurrency, the board of adjustment shall make specific findings that the certificate of concurrency satisfies section 22-18.06 of this Code. The affirmative vote of three (3) members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to recommend issuance of a certificate of concurrency. Action taken by the board of adjustment to affirm, reverse or modify the administrative decision to deny the certificate of concurrency shall be documented in writing. The written decision of the board of adjustment shall be submitted to city council for final action. The city clerk shall give written notice to the applicant of the date, time and location of the city council meeting considering the certificate of concurrency. The city council, upon reviewing the record and findings of the board of adjustment, may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the board of adjustment. If deemed necessary by the city council, in order to supplement the record, the city council may receive additional testimony and may make inquiry of the applicant and administrative staff.

The council's purpose in enacting this chapter is to promote the public health and welfare of all persons who live in, visit and work in the city. It is important for the city to ensure that all persons within the city have equal access to employment, housing, public accommodations, and education.
