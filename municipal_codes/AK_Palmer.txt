2.04.160 Council community grants.
The city of Palmer recognizes the valued contributions being provided through the volunteer efforts of community organizations, agencies, and individuals on behalf of its citizens. Community grant funding demonstrates council’s commitment to programs, services, projects and events (event) that are benefits to the community while at the same time recognizing the financial constraints impacting the city’s ability to provide funding.
A. This policy identifies the types of funding available through this grant process, establishes eligibility requirements, and outlines application and monitoring requirements.
B. Council shall retain the right to make the final decision on both the overall grant allocation and individual grants.
    1. Preference will be given to organizations and groups that demonstrate Palmer community support and that propose programs, services, projects or events having the potential for positive economic and cultural impacts and that show evidence of efficient use of resources, sound business practices/accountability, and describe the organization’s or group’s knowledge, skills and self-reliance.
    2. The board of economic development will review this grant policy at least every two years and forward any recommendations for updates or revisions to the policy to city council.
C. The aim of the community grant program is to provide modest levels of support and assistance to help foster and develop community programs, services, projects and events that enhance the greater Palmer community’s cultural and economic environment. The objective of this policy is to treat all organizations fairly and consistently while creating a minimal administrative process.
D. Each year, as part of its annual budget process, council will, through its annual operating budget, determine the amount of funds to be allocated to the community grant program.
E. The different types of grants eligible under the community grants program are:
    1. In-kind contributions grants – based on the provision of municipal property/facilities, materials or resources to an applicant, and do not include the provision of cash funds to, or on behalf of, the applicant. While cash funds are not provided in relation to in-kind grants, it is recognized that such grants will involve either an expense or foregone revenue for the municipality.
    2. Special events grant – defined as seed money funding for the start-up of a community program, service, project or event, or funds for a short-term undertaking to assist in developing a program, service, project or event that is of cultural, social, recreational or economic significance to the community. Special events grants are startup funds; therefore these grants are limited to funding for between one to five years.
    3. Community event grant – defined as a recurring program, service, project or event that council has determined provides significant benefits to the broad community as a whole; therefore there is no limit to the number of times a community event grant application may be funded.
    4. Organization grant – defined as a 501(c) organization in need of a one-time appropriation for administration expenses or project money to further mission of the organization.
F. An applicant organization must meet the following general criteria in order to be eligible for a Palmer council community grant:
    1. Event must primarily benefit the community and residents of Palmer.
    2. Event has city-wide significance and is expected to bring economic and/or public relations benefit to the city.
    3. Grant applicants should be able to demonstrate active fundraising efforts to support the continuation of the program, project or service. The city grant should not be considered as the primary source of funding for the organization.
    4. Funding requests can be defined as programs, services, projects, and events that economically benefit Palmer by supporting, sustaining, promoting, informing, educating, celebrating, preserving and/or providing access to the arts, culture, environment, heritage, recreation and/or health activities.
    5. To qualify for funding, the group must demonstrate its commitment to all of the following principles:
        a. Event is open – accessible – to all members of the community;
        b. Event must take place within the Palmer city limits or within one mile of the city limits;
        c. Event is effective in providing an economic benefit to Palmer;
        d. Applicant is accountable through sound management and financial practices;
        e. Individuals are not eligible.
    6. Grants are awarded by the type of project, not the type of organization/agency.
    7. The applicant/organization, within the current fiscal year, must spend grant funding on the sole purpose for which it was awarded.
    8. Members of the board of economic development are available to provide mentoring assistance to all applicants, both while preparing an application and following a grant award.
    9. All applications shall be submitted on the grant application form together with the following information and documentation:
        a. An outline of the economic benefits the event provides to the community as well as how this supports council’s economic development strategic priorities;
        b. The amount of financial or in-kind assistance required;
        c. The degree in which the community benefits as a result of the grant;
        d. A detailed proposed budget for the current project, detailing expenditures and anticipated revenues, including a list of all other grants and/or donations;
        e. How applicant proposes to provide a post-event report with details on economic impact;
        f. Applicants seeking funding for consecutive years will be required to provide a multi-year financial forecast (three to five years) for the event which should include estimated revenues and expenditures;
        g. Completed application forms may be submitted to the city manager’s office at any time during a fiscal year.
    10. The city manager will review grant applications and forward each application to the city council with a funding recommendation and comments. The manager’s comments on applications for in-kind nonfinancial assistance will include a report on the effect, if any, providing the in-kind assistance would have on the city’s ability to meet its regularly scheduled work responsibilities.
    11. Council shall retain the right to make the final decision on both the overall grant allocation and individual grants.
    12. Grant recipients will be notified in writing of the grant amount approved. (Ord. 14-043 § 3, 2015)

C. Vital Records. “Vital records” are those records necessary to assure continuance of essential governmental operations to protect the legal and financial operation of the city in the event of disaster or catastrophic loss of the city’s records.
D. Legal Value. A record has “legal value” if it relates to current or possible legal action by or against the city, and records relating to land, construction, legislative and judicial actions of the city council, or potential court claims.

Periods may be assigned for records stages such as on-site (office) retention, off-site (storage) retention, and total retention.

No record shall be destroyed until the records manager has signed the records disposal form filled out by the department records coordinator.
C. The records manager shall cause records stored in computer memory device systems to be reviewed, stored, and destroyed in the same manner and at the same time as if the records were maintained in written, printed or photographic form.

E. The records manager shall develop and provide for records management procedures and regulations, and for the circulation of such procedures and the retention schedule.

A. Form and Requirements. 
    1. The property owner petition shall be in a form prescribed by the city manager and shall include a description of the improvement sought by the petition.
    2. The petition shall be signed by all the owners of a majority of the parcels in the district. A property owner may not withdraw his or her signature of approval for six months after the petition has been filed with the clerk unless authorized by the council.
    3. On receipt of a petition proposing formation of a local improvement district, the manager shall submit the petition to the clerk for certification.
    4. Once certified by the clerk, the clerk shall forward the petition to the manager for further action.
    5. A petition found insufficient by the clerk shall be immediately returned to the petition sponsor by the manager.
B. City Manager Action. The city manager shall prepare a survey and report in the form of a resolution to the council concerning the need for and the estimated cost of the district. The report shall contain:
    1. A plan defining the district, outlining the properties to be assessed and showing the desirable extent of the proposed improvement.
    2. The number of parcels in the district and the following information for each parcel:
        a. Front feet;
        b. Square feet;
        c. Square feet per 30-foot zone; and
        d. Assessed value using the then most-current Matanuska-Susitna Borough assessed values (to include “work in progress” values) of land and improvements.
    3. The district may be defined:
        a. By a boundary description; or
        b. By a designation of the properties to be assessed within the district by lot, block, and subdivision; or
        c. If unsubdivided, by other appropriate designation, which designation may generally refer to streets, alleys, intersections and all other public properties and rights-of-way to be included within the district as “and included public streets, rights-of-way and properties.”
    4. Upon receipt and consideration of the resolution, the council may propose the formation of a local improvement district with such boundaries, improvements, and assessment formula as the council determines appropriate.
C. Public Hearing. After the notices of the hearing required in PMC 3.08.085 are given, the council shall hold a public hearing on the resolution concerning the necessity for the proposed improvement. The city clerk shall fix the time and place of the public hearing, which may be continued from time to time as the council may decide. After the public hearing, the council may decrease the extent or value of the improvement, or may delete from the district properties not benefited in whole or in part by the improvement.
D. Property Owner Protest. If protests in writing as to the necessity of a local improvement are made by the owners of property who shall bear 50 percent or more of the estimated assessable cost of the improvement, the council shall not proceed with the improvement until the protests have been reduced to less than 50 percent, except upon the approval of at least five members of the council. Written protests shall be submitted to the city clerk by 5:00 p.m. on the day the council meets to consider the resolution.
E. Council Action. After the public hearing is closed, the council shall consider the resolution regarding the proposed improvement. The council resolution shall:
    1. Find that the improvement is necessary and of benefit to the properties to be assessed. The findings of the council are conclusive.
    2. Require an account to be kept of all costs of the improvement and direct the city manager to prepare the assessment roll.
    3. Assess the authorized percentage or rate of the costs of the improvement against the properties within the district. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 597 §§ 3, 4, 2002; Ord. 508 § 3, 1997; Ord. 196 § 3(a), 1976)

3.08.025 Assessment roll and resolution confirming the assessment roll.
A. After the improvement has been completed and the costs of the improvement computed, the city manager shall prepare an assessment roll for the local improvement district. The assessment roll shall contain, as to each property to be assessed:
    1. A brief description or designation of the property;
    2. The name of the owner or reputed owner of the property to be assessed; and
    3. The amount assessed against the property.
B. Public Hearing. 
    1. When the assessment roll is completed, the city clerk shall fix a time and place for a public hearing on objections to the assessment roll. The notices required in this section shall be given in accordance with PMC 3.08.085.
    2. At the public hearing, an owner of property to be assessed shall have the right to present his or her objection to the assessment roll by showing errors and inequalities in the assessment roll and submitting any reason for amendment and correction of the assessment roll. The public hearing may be continued from time to time as the council shall decide.
    3. After the public hearing, the council may correct any error or inequality in the assessment roll. When the roll is finally determined, the city clerk shall so certify.
C. Confirmation. After the public hearing and determination of the assessment roll, the council, by resolution, shall confirm the special assessment roll of the local improvement district. The resolution shall provide for the levy and the payment schedule of the assessment. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009)

3.08.050 Determination of legal owner.
The person or persons whose name is listed on the latest borough assessment roll as the owner of the property to be assessed is presumed to be the legal owner of the property. If the property owner is unknown, the property may be assessed in the name of “unknown owner.” No assessment is invalidated by a mistake, omission or error in the name of the owner if the property is correctly described. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 509 § 3, 1997; Ord. 196 § 5, 1976)

3.08.060 Amount assessed.
A. The council may assess up to 100 percent of any or all costs of a public improvement against each parcel of property benefited by the improvement. Unless a specific method of computation of the benefit to the property is expressly provided for ascertaining the amount to be assessed against the property benefited by a designated improvement, the council shall assess each parcel of property in a local improvement district in proportion to, and not to exceed, the value of the benefits received from the improvement.
B. If grant funds are available and applied toward the costs of a public improvement, the council, in its discretion, may apply such funds to the assessed costs, unassessed costs, or both. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 597 § 6, 2002; Ord. 539 § 3, 1998; Ord. 196 § 6, 1976)

3.08.070 Cost determination.
The costs of an improvement shall be the actual costs of the improvement, including acquisition of interests in land for the improvement, design, engineering, administration, overhead, professional services, bond costs and interest incurred as a result of the improvement, and all other costs resulting from the construction of the improvement. Bond interest shall be calculated from the first date when any actual costs are incurred by the city. (Ord. 196 § 7, 1976)

3.08.081 Allocation of costs.
A. The council shall determine the method of assessment allocation for each local improvement district. Any determination made by the council with respect to the method of allocating costs is final.
B. The following methods of allocation of assessed costs among benefited properties are permitted:
    1. Allocation of costs based on the then most-current Matanuska-Susitna Borough assessed values (to include “work in progress” values) of land and improvements;
    2. Allocation of costs on a front-foot basis, including adjusted and unadjusted front-foot;
    3. Allocation of costs on a square-foot basis;
    4. Allocation of costs on a per-lot basis so that each lot is assessed the same amount;
    5. Allocation of costs on a zone square-foot basis;
    6. Allocation of costs on any other reasonable basis or combination of bases (including without limitation subsection (B)(1) through (5) of this section) which results in an assessment proportionate to the benefit received, to include, without limitation, allocation that takes into account different zoning districts and future use to which property is reasonably adaptable within a reasonably foreseeable time. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 597 § 8, 2002)

3.08.085 Public hearing notice.
Notice by publication and mail shall be given of any public hearing required in this chapter. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least once a week for two consecutive weeks before the time fixed for the hearing. The clerk shall send a written notice by first-class mail at least 15 days before the time of the hearing to persons whose names appear on the current assessment roll as owners of real property within the local improvement district. The notice to be published shall include a summary of the improvement, the designation of the properties to be assessed in the local improvement district, the purpose of the public hearing, and the time and place fixed for the public hearing. The notice by mail shall include a summary of the improvement, the designation of the addressee’s property to be assessed, the purpose of the public hearing, the amount of estimated or actual assessment against the property, and the time and place fixed for the public hearing. Each notice shall generally inform the assessment roll owners of the manner and method of protesting or objecting to the action to be taken at the public hearing. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009)

3.08.090 Assessment notice – Contents – Mailing.
A. Within 30 days after the resolution confirming the assessment roll and fixing the date of delinquency, the director of the department of finance shall mail, with postage prepaid, a notice to the owner of each property assessed. The notice shall:
    1. Designate the property;
    2. State the amount of the assessment;
    3. Describe the schedule of payments and delinquencies; and
    4. List the amount of the penalty and interest.
B. Not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before the date the assessment or the first installment of the assessment becomes delinquent, the director of the department of finance shall mail a payment notice to each property owner, but the failure to mail the notice shall in no way affect any liability for or enforcement of payment of all or any part of the special assessment.
C. Within five days after the statements are mailed, the city clerk shall publish notice that the statements have been mailed. (Ord. 13-014 § 3, 2013; Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 288 § 3, 1984; Ord. 196 § 9, 1976)

3.08.100 Payment schedule – Delinquency interest.
A. The council, in the resolution confirming the assessment roll, shall fix a schedule of dates when the special assessment or special assessment installment payments become due and delinquent. Deferred or installment payments shall bear an interest rate as established in the current, adopted budget at the time the council confirms the assessment roll until paid, except that no interest shall be charged if payment in full is made within 60 days of the resolution, or the time set out in the resolution for the first payment. No payment shall be required within 60 days after the resolution.
B. A penalty established in the current, adopted budget shall be added to any assessment or assessment installment (or interest installment under subsection (E)(4) of this section), whichever is less, not paid before the date of delinquency or unless a monthly payment plan has been approved, and both the assessment and penalty shall draw an interest rate as established in the current, adopted budget at the time the council confirms the assessment roll per year until paid.
C. Monthly installment payments may be scheduled upon the written request of the property owners and written approval by the city manager. Monthly installments shall carry the interest rate as established in the current, adopted budget at the time the council confirms the assessment roll and shall be due and payable on or before the tenth day and will be deemed delinquent with the penalty established in the current, adopted budget on the amount delinquent, which shall bear interest as established in the current, adopted budget.
D. When a property owner owns more than one lot in an improvement district, the total assessment of all the lots shall determine the repayment schedule. The repayment schedule is as follows:
    1. Assessments totaling $1,500.99 or less shall pay the same in three equal annual installments;
    2. A property owner with assessments of $1,501 to $3,500.99 shall pay the same in five equal annual installments;
    3. A property owner with assessments of $3,501 to $6,500.99 shall pay the same in 10 equal annual installments;
    4. A property owner with assessments of $6,501 or more shall pay the same in 20 equal annual installments.
E. When a property owner owns property in more than one improvement district, the improvement district whose roll is spread first shall be repaid first. Subject to the following, replacement of the assessment amount for the parcel or parcels in the second district will be deferred:
    1. The owner must submit a written request for the deferral;
    2. The request must be approved in writing by the city manager;
    3. The repayment schedule shall not be deferred for more than two parcels in the second assessment district. No deferral will be granted for a parcel in a third or other assessment district. For purposes of this section, assessment districts for different purposes, e.g., road, water and sewer, covering substantially the same area are considered a single assessment district;
    4. The first $10,000 of interest arising from the deferred assessment during the deferral period shall not be charged. All interest arising from the deferred assessment during the deferral period in excess of $10,000 shall be due the city annually, even during the period the payment on the assessment itself is deferred. All interest arising after the deferral period ends shall be charged;
    5. The deferral period shall end upon:
        a. The actual repayment of all the assessments due on the first assessment district;
        b. Upon the date when the last payment is due under the repayment schedule for the first assessment district; or
        c. Upon transfer of ownership of the last parcel owned in the first assessment district, whichever occurs first;
    6. Upon the transfer of ownership of a parcel for which there is a deferred assessment, an assessment payment for that parcel only shall be due immediately in the amount which would be due if no deferment had been granted. Interest not charged shall not be included. Repayment will commence according to the original repayment schedule for that parcel. Repayment for the remaining untransferred parcel, if any, for which repayment was deferred shall continue to be deferred until the deferral period ends. The repayment schedule for the remaining parcel shall be determined by consideration of the amount assessed only against it, and not by adding the amount assessed against the parcel sold;
    7. Transfer of ownership shall include any transfer of title or a lease for 10 years or more, whether by law or otherwise, but shall not include a transfer between spouses;
    8. If the owner transfers ownership of a parcel for which the payment of assessments has been deferred, neither the owner nor the new owner will be entitled to a deferral of assessment payments for the parcel transferred or for any additional parcel in any district. (Ord. 13-014 § 4, 2013; Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 07-029 § 6, 2007; Ord. 581 § 3, 2001; Ord. 367 § 3, 1987; Ord. 303 § 3, 1984; Ord. 293 § 3, 1984; Ord. 288 § 3, 1984; Ord. 196 § 10, 1976)

3.08.110 Lien – Priority – Collection.
A. A special assessment shall be a first lien prior and paramount to all liens, except city and borough real property tax liens, upon the property assessed from the time the special assessment is levied in the resolution confirming the assessment roll, and the lien shall be of the same character, effect and duration as a lien for city and borough real property taxes.
B. A lien for a special assessment may be collected, foreclosed and otherwise enforced in accordance with the procedures provided for the collection, foreclosure and enforcement of municipal tax liens on real property, and no person shall have any right to repurchase or redeem the tax-foreclosed property except as provided by such procedures.
C. The city may devote the property to a public purpose or use by resolution or other action of the council showing the council’s intent to devote the property to a public purpose or use.
D. The city shall have the cumulative remedy for collection of a special assessment by civil action against the property owner for debt or foreclosure with the right of redemption as provided by law for real property mortgage foreclosures.
E. The remedies provided by this section may apply to reassessments. (Ord. 09-010 § 3, 2009; Ord. 196 § 11, 1976)

3.08.120 Limitations on suits and actions.
No special assessment procedure shall be contested in any civil action unless commenced within 60 days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll for the assessment. If no such action is so commenced, the procedure shall be conclusively presumed to have been regular and complete. (Ord. 196 § 12, 1976)

3.08.130 Waiver of objections.
The irregularity or validity of any special assessment procedure is waived and may not be contested or questioned in any manner in any proceeding whatsoever by any person not filing a written objection to the assessment roll prior to its confirmation. (Ord. 196 § 13, 1976)

3.08.140 Cumulative enforcement.
The collection, foreclosure or enforcement of any installment or any part of a special assessment shall not bar, prevent or otherwise extinguish the right of the city to collect, foreclose or enforce the payment of any other installment or part of the same or any other special assessment. (Ord. 196 § 14, 1976)

3.08.150 Superior court review.
The decision of the council upon any objection to the assessment roll may be reviewed by the superior court, Third Judicial District, Alaska, in the manner provided by law. (Ord. 196 § 15, 1976)

3.08.160 Correction of invalidities – Reassessments – Adjustments.
A. If any special assessment procedure of the council is irregular or invalid for any reason, the council may correct the same at any time within 90 days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll or after final determination of any litigation thereon, whether before or after the completion of the local improvement to which the special assessment applies.
B. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction orders that any or all of a special assessment may not be assessed or enforced by the council because of any irregular or invalid special assessment procedure, the council may make a new assessment or reassessment upon the properties specially benefited by the improvement by adopting a resolution to make a new assessment or a reassessment of the properties specially benefited by the improvement. The council in the resolution shall provide for the time and date of a public hearing on the new assessment or reassessment, shall direct the city manager to prepare the assessment roll and shall assess the appropriate assessment against the property in the district. The previous findings of benefit and necessity for the improvement shall continue in full force and effect in any assessment or reassessment unless invalidated by a court order.
C. In the event that findings of necessity and benefit are necessary to correct the irregular or invalid special assessment procedure, the council may proceed to make a new assessment or reassessment of the property specially benefited by initiating a council-initiated special assessment district.
D. 
    1. In any new assessment or reassessment by the council, all sums paid upon the former assessment shall be credited to the property upon any new assessment or reassessment, and the new assessment or reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied.
    2. If a refund, rather than a credit, is determined, then the council, in the resolution confirming the assessment roll, shall provide for a refund to the person having paid the amount of assessment to be refunded.
    3. No interest or penalty shall be charged by virtue of the fact that the original assessment was not pursued to completion.
E. The new assessment or reassessment, when completed, shall be enforced and collected in the same manner that special assessments are enforced and collected. (Ord. 196 § 17, 1976)

3.08.170 Retention of rights.
The city retains any right or procedure, not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, granted by law to a first-class or home rule charter city for local improvements and special assessments. (Ord. 196 § 16, 1976)

B. Business improvement districts shall provide an enhanced or supplemental public service(s) or new public service(s) not generally provided by the city. The establishment of a business improvement district shall not operate unilaterally or by implication as a substitute for or to reduce or eliminate the nature or extent of services provided by other means.
C. More than one category of service may be provided in a single business improvement district. Different categories of service may be of the same type of service provided at different levels. (Ord. 05-041 § 3, 2005)

The city may contract for services provided in a business improvement district subject to the following requirements in addition to other applicable provisions of this code:
A. All contracts for services shall specify a contract dollar amount for services to be provided.
B. All contracts for services shall require and the contractor shall provide liability insurance and indemnification of the city insuring and indemnifying the city against any and all claims arising out of the selection of the contract and/or the contractor’s performance of the contract.

Such assets shall include all unencumbered cash or its equivalent including services, and other assets loaned or provided to the contractor by or through the city regardless of funding source. (Ord. 05-041 § 3, 2005)

3.10.040 Term.

A. The city may fund a business improvement district through a special property tax levied and collected by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough on behalf of the city.

C. The mill rate for a business improvement district may not exceed three mills; provided, that the petition to initiate a business improvement district may set a lower mill rate, which may not be exceeded. Subject to this limitation, the business improvement district committee (representing property owners who will bear more than 50 percent of the estimated special property taxes for a district) shall annually request the council to set a specific mill rate for the next year. The request must be in writing and delivered to the city clerk between July 1st and November 15th. The council shall consider the request, and then the council shall exercise its discretion and set the mill rate at a rate that best services the public interest. If the committee fails to duly request a specific mill rate, then the council will set the mill rate at zero.

3.10.070 Districts – Initiation.
A. Form and Requirements. 
    1. The petition to initiate a business improvement district shall be in a form prescribed by the city manager and shall include a description (by tax lot) of the proposed district to be created by the petition.
    2. The petition shall specify the following for the business improvement district:
        a. The maximum mill rate that may be levied;
        b. The term; and
        c. The services to be provided.
    3. The original or copies of the petition shall be signed by all the owners of the tax lots in the district that will bear at least 50 percent of the special property tax for the district.
    4. No property owner may withdraw its signature of approval for six months after the petition in proper form has been filed with the city clerk unless authorized by the council.
    5. The petition, when signed, shall be filed with the city clerk. The clerk, with such assistance as may be needed, shall determine whether the petition is in proper form. If the petition is not in proper form, the clerk shall return the petition to the petitioners, explaining in writing any deficiencies.
B. Public Hearing. After the notices of the hearing required in this section are given, the council shall hold a public hearing regarding the net beneficial effect to the properties bearing the cost of the proposed business improvement district. The council or city manager shall fix the time and place of the public hearing, which may be continued from time to time as the council may decide. After hearing interested persons, including those favoring or opposing the proposed business improvement district, the council may delete from the district properties not benefited in whole or in part by the district. No change may be made resulting in a district containing petitioners of properties bearing less than 50 percent of the special property tax for the district.
C. Council Action. After the public hearing is closed, the council may adopt an ordinance determining that there is a net beneficial effect to the properties bearing the cost of the proposed business improvement district, that the petition for the improvement has been signed by sufficient and proper petitioners, and that the business improvement district is established. These findings of the council are conclusive. The ordinance must state the description (by tax lot) of the district, the maximum mill rate that may be levied, the term, the services to be provided, and that the city must keep a separate account of all income and expenses of the district. The ordinance may also include such conditions and limitations as the council deems necessary to assure fairness and equity in allocating benefits within the district. The council shall take all necessary action to request the borough assembly to establish the special property tax for the district and inform the assembly of the mill rate and exemptions.
D. Notice. Notice by publication and mail shall be given of any public hearing required in this section. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least once a week for two consecutive weeks before the time fixed for the hearing. The city clerk shall send a written notice by first-class mail at least 15 days before the time of the hearing to persons whose names appear on the current assessment roll as owners of real property within the proposed business improvement district. The notice to be published shall include a summary of the business improvement district, the designation of the properties in the district, the purpose of the public hearing, and the time and place fixed for the public hearing. The notice by mail shall include a summary of the district, the designation of the addressee’s property to be included in the district, the purpose of the public hearing, the amount of estimated annual taxes against the property based on the prior year’s borough tax-assessed value, and the time and place fixed for the public hearing. Each notice shall generally inform the owners that they may object to the action to be taken at the public hearing. (Ord. 05-041 § 3, 2005)

3.10.080 Limitation on suits and actions.
No business improvement district procedure shall be contested in any civil action unless commenced within 60 days after the passage of the ordinance creating the business improvement district. If no such action is so commenced, the procedure shall be conclusively presumed to have been regular and complete. (Ord. 05-041 § 3, 2005)

B. The appellant shall, within 30 days after the date of mailing of notice of assessment, submit to the assessor a written appeal specifying grounds in the form that the board of equalization may require.

C. The assessor shall notify an appellant by mail of the time and place of hearing.
D. The assessor shall prepare for use by the board of equalization a summary of assessment data relating to each assessment that is appealed. (Ord. 479 § 3, 1995)

3.12.210 Board of equalization.
A. The board of equalization is the borough board of equalization; provided, however, if the borough board refuses to perform its duties for the city, then the following applies. There is established the board of equalization, composed of three regular members and two alternate members. The board of equalization members may not be council members. All members of the board of equalization are appointed by the council. Alternate members are selected to serve by the board’s presiding officer to fill a vacancy or an absence of a regular board member. All members of the board of equalization shall be appointed on the basis of their expertise in real and personal property appraisal, the real estate market, the personal property market, and other fields related to their functions as board members. The board of equalization shall be called as required for equalization matters. A presiding officer shall be selected by the board at its first annual meeting. Appeals to the board of equalization must be in writing, have been timely filed with the assessor as required, and reviewed by the assessment department prior to the meeting of the board. The assessor shall notify the appellant of the date and time that the appeal will be heard. No action of the board may be taken except upon concurrence of a majority of the members present.
B. Board members shall be compensated at the rate of $50.00 per meeting. All requests for reimbursement shall be actual expenses incurred on authorized board business. (Ord. 479 § 3, 1995)

3.12.220 Board of equalization – Hearing.
A. An appeal before the board of equalization shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures adopted by the board, in addition to the following rules:
    1. If an appellant fails to appear in person, the board of equalization may proceed with the hearing.
    2. Anyone testifying before the board shall be administered an oath prior to giving testimony.
    3. Record. The clerk shall keep verbatim stenographic records or electronic recordings of the board’s proceedings, showing the vote of each member on every question and all of the evidence presented.
    4. Counsel. All parties may be represented by counsel during hearings before the board. The borough attorney or the city attorney may offer legal counsel to the board in the course of its proceedings.
    5. Case Number. Every appeal shall be assigned a case number which shall be read into the record along with the name of the appellant before the hearing on that appeal commences.
    6. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof rests on the appellant. The only grounds for adjustment of an assessment are unequal, excessive, improper, or under-valuation based on the facts that are stated in a valid written appeal or provided at the appeal hearing. If the valuation is found to be too low, the board of equalization may raise the assessment. The borough or the city shall make available to the appellant all reasonably pertinent documents requested by the appellant at least five days before the hearing.
    7. Rules of Evidence. The board shall not be restricted by the formal rules of evidence; however, the chairman may exclude evidence irrelevant to the issues appealed. Hearsay evidence may be considered; provided, that there are adequate guarantees of its trustworthiness and that it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure by reasonable efforts.
    8. Order of Presentation. The appellant shall present argument first. Following the appellant, the assessor shall present the borough’s or the city’s argument. The appellant may, at the discretion of the chairman, make rebuttal presentations directed solely to the issues raised by the assessor. The borough attorney or the city attorney may question the appellant or the assessor on matters relating to the appeal. The members of the board may ask questions, through the chairman, of either the appellant or the assessor at any time during the hearing. After both the appellant and the assessor have presented their arguments, each may question the other through the chair.
    9. Witnesses and Exhibits. The appellant and the assessor may offer oral testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence during the hearing. All testimony before the board shall be under oath.
    10. Upon presentation of all testimony, the board may conclude the hearing and determine whether the assessment is proper. The board shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law clearly stating the grounds upon which the board relied to reach its decision.
    11. Certification. The board shall certify its decision for an appeal to the assessor within seven days following its issuance.
    12. Other procedures and rules of operation may be adopted by the board of equalization.
B. Further Appeals. The appellant or the assessor may appeal a decision of the board to the superior court within 30 days in accordance with the Alaska State Rules of Appellate Procedure.
C. If the borough refuses to provide a clerk for the board, then the city shall provide a clerk of the board of equalization who shall record in the minutes of the meeting all proceedings before the board and the names of all persons appealing assessments. All changes, revisions, corrections, and orders relating to claims or adjustments, and all final decisions shall be recorded in the record to be kept by the clerk and to be known as the appeal record. Within seven days following the final hearings of the board, the board chair shall transmit to the assessor all corrections, revisions, or changes authorized and approved by the board and shall certify that the changes so reported are as approved by the board of equalization. (Ord. 479 § 3, 1995)

3.12.230 Enforcement of tax obligations.
A. Real and personal property tax obligations are liens upon the property which are prior and paramount to all other liens or encumbrances against the property. Enforcement of property tax obligations shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state law and the procedures contained in this chapter.
B. Distraint. The lien of personal property taxes may be enforced by distraint and sale of the property pursuant to this subsection.
    1. Upon application to the trial courts and after written demand is first made of the person assessed for the amount of tax, penalty, and interest owing, the manager or designee may obtain a judicial order directing that property for which such taxes, penalty, and interest are owed shall be distrained and held for further proceedings; provided, however, the borough or the city demonstrates specific facts by affidavit based on personal knowledge that the property:
        a. Has been concealed, is concealed, or about to be concealed;
        b. Is about to be destroyed;
        c. Is in the process of or about to be removed from the jurisdiction;
        d. Is about to be conveyed or encumbered; or
        e. Is otherwise being disposed of, or about to be disposed of, in a manner so as to defraud the city.
    2. Upon execution of an order distraining the property, a hearing will be conducted no more than seven days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, following execution of the order, at which time the validity of the borough’s or the city’s lien shall be tested and other matters relevant to disposition of the tax obligation will be heard. The owner, upon execution of the order, will be notified of the time and place set for hearing. In the event personal service on the owner is impossible, alternative methods of service consistent with the Alaska State Rules of Civil Procedure may be employed, but in no case may the hearing required by this section be held more than seven days following the date of actual or constructive service on the legal owner.
    3. At the hearing described in subsection (B)(2) of this section, the borough or city and the legal owner of the property distrained may present evidence and offer arguments as are helpful in determining whether there exists a valid lien for personal property taxes on the property distrained, and whether such taxes, penalty, and interest remain unpaid. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court, with or without a jury, finds that there exists a valid lien on the property distrained and that taxes, penalty, or interest on such property are unpaid, it shall issue an order of sale directing that such property be sold to satisfy the tax obligation.
    4. Order of sale issued pursuant to this section shall require sale by public auction, and may not be effective sooner than 15 days following the hearing described in subsection (B)(3) of this section. Proceeds shall be applied first to attorneys’ fees, costs, penalty, interest, and taxes; remaining proceeds shall be returned to the last owner of the property distrained.
C. Civil Action. The borough or the city may, in addition to other remedies provided in this chapter, initiate civil actions to collect unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest. (Ord. 479 § 3, 1995)

3.12.240 Rates of penalty and interest and collection of administrative costs.
A penalty as established in the current, adopted budget of the tax due shall be added to all delinquent taxes on the day they become delinquent and every 30 days thereafter. In addition to interest and penalty, the borough or the city may collect all costs associated with managing and maintaining the property or any costs authorized by law. A penalty as established in the current, adopted budget on tax due shall accrue upon the late return of personal property assessments. The penalty and interest on all unpaid installments accrue from the date the installment becomes due. (Ord. 07-029 § 8, 2007; Ord. 479 § 3, 1995)

3.12.250 Foreclosure list.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all returns, reports and information required to be filed with the city under this chapter, and all information deducible from such filed returns, reports and information shall be kept confidential and are not subject to public inspection. Except upon court order, such returns, reports and information shall be made available only to employees and agents of the city whose job responsibilities are directly related to such returns, reports and information; to the person supplying such returns, reports, and information; and to persons authorized in writing by the person supplying such returns, reports and information. The following information shall be made available to the public: The name and address of current business license holders; whether a business license holder is more than 30 days delinquent in filing returns and in remitting sales tax; and if so delinquent, the amount or estimated amount of sales tax due and the number of returns not filed. The city manager or his designee may, from time to time, publish the names of sellers delinquent in remitting sales taxes and the amount thereof. Information may also be made available to the public in the form of statistical reports if the identity of particular sellers is not revealed by the reports. (Ord. 375 § 3, 1987)

3.16.087 Tax records – Inspection and audit.
The records that a seller is required to maintain under this chapter shall be subject to inspection and copying by authorized employees or agents of the city for the purpose of auditing any return filed under this chapter, or to determine the seller’s liability for sales tax where no return has been filed. In addition to the information required on returns, the city may request, and the seller must furnish, any information deemed necessary for a correct computation of the tax. The city may adjust a return for a seller if, after investigation or audit, the city determines that the figures included in the original return are incorrect, and that additional sales taxes are due, and the city adjusts the return within three years of the original due date for the return. (Ord. 10-019 § 8, 2010)

3.16.090 Tax records – Final tax return.
It shall be the duty of every seller required to make a return and pay over any tax under this chapter to keep and preserve suitable records of the gross daily sales together with invoices of purchases and sales, bills of lading, bills of sales and other pertinent records and documents which may be necessary to determine the amount of tax due under this chapter and such other records of goods, wares, merchandise and other subjects of taxation under this chapter as will substantiate and prove the accuracy of such returns. It shall also be the duty of every seller who makes exempt sales to keep records of such sales, which shall be subject to examination by the city or any authorized employee thereof while engaged in checking or auditing the records of any seller required to make a report under the terms of this chapter. All such records shall remain in the city and be preserved for a period of three years after payment of the taxes, unless the city has authorized, in writing, their destruction or disposal at an earlier date, and shall be open to examination at any time by the city or any authorized employee or agent thereof while engaged in checking such records. The burden of proving that a sale, rental or service was not taxable shall be upon the seller.
Any seller who filed or should have filed a sales tax return for the prior month shall file a return for the current month even though no tax may be due. This return shall show why no tax is due and, if the business is sold, the name of the person to whom it was sold. If any seller sells, leases or otherwise disposes of his business, he shall make a final sales tax return within 15 days after the date of sale. (Ord. 445 § 6, 1992; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.9)

3.16.095 Liability of third parties.
A. If any seller sells, assigns, transfers, conveys, leases, forfeits, abandons or otherwise disposes of the business or accounts receivable, then the purchaser, successor, transferee, lessee, assignee, creditor or secured party shall withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase money or loan to pay the amount of such sales taxes, penalties, administrative costs and interest as may be due and unpaid to the city and to pay such to the city. If the purchaser, assignee, transferee, lessee, successor, creditor or secured party fails to withhold from the purchase money or loan, or fails to otherwise provide for or make the payment of the taxes, interest, administrative costs and penalties owed by the business as provided in this chapter, then the purchaser, assignee, transferee, lessee, successor, creditor or secured party shall be personally liable, jointly and severally with the seller, for the payment of the taxes, penalties, administrative costs and interest accruing and unpaid to the city on account of the operation of the business of any former owner, owners, operators or assigns. This section is in addition to any rights of the city arising under AS 45.06.101 et seq.
B. Upon termination, dissolution or abandonment of a corporate business, any officer having control or supervision of sales tax funds collected or who is charged with the responsibility for the filing of returns or the payment of sales tax funds collected, shall be personally liable for any unpaid taxes, interest, administrative costs, and penalties on those taxes, if such officer willfully fails to pay or cause to be paid any taxes due from the corporation. In addition, regardless of willfulness, each director of the corporation shall be jointly and severally liable for said amounts. The officer shall be liable only for taxes collected which became due during the period he or she had the control, supervision, responsibility, or duty to act for the corporation. This section does not relieve the corporation of other tax liabilities or otherwise impair other tax collection remedies afforded by law. (Ord. 445 § 7, 1992)

3.16.100 Collection upon sale.
A. The tax levied under this chapter shall be paid by the buyer, and it shall be the duty of every seller to collect from the buyer the full amount of the tax, except that the tax on receipts or proceeds from various mechanical devices as provided in PMC 3.16.150 shall be paid by the operator thereof.
B. Every seller shall add the amount of the tax levied by this chapter to the total sale price, and the tax shall be stated separately on any sales receipts or slips, rent receipts, charge tickets, invoices, statements of account or other tangible evidence of sale. When so stated, the tax shall constitute a part of such price and shall be a debt from the buyer to the seller until paid and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.
C. Seller shall be charged the fee established in the adopted budget for failure to collect the tax required by this chapter. (Ord. 14-024 § 4, 2014; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.10)

3.16.120 City manager regulation promulgation authority.
The city manager may take any action necessary or appropriate to the implementation of this chapter by promulgation of regulations which may include the adoption of forms. Such regulations or any proceedings adopted by the city manager are effective at the time indicated by him, but are subject to revision or repeal by the city council at the next meeting following their effective date or at the time that the council acts thereon. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.12)

3.16.150 Public statement of tax required – Exception for coin-operated machines.
A seller shall not advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any buyer, directly or indirectly, that the tax payment or any part thereof imposed by this chapter will be assumed or absorbed by the seller or that it will not be added to the sales price or that it will be refunded or absorbed in whole or in part. The seller shall, whenever feasible, separately state the tax to the buyer on each taxable transaction. When not feasible to state separately, the seller shall prominently display a sign indicating the imposition of the tax. The revenue from a coin-operated machine shall be treated in gross on a monthly basis, without reference to the amount paid or played on a particular transaction. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.15)

3.16.160 Liability for payment – Protest of tax.
A. A seller shall determine in the first instance whether a sale is exempt under this chapter; however, if the seller incorrectly determines that a sale is exempt, the seller is liable to the city for the tax just as if he had collected it.
B. If the seller determines that a transaction is not exempt, but the buyer believes the transaction to be exempt, then the buyer may protest.
    1. A buyer who protests the payment of the tax levied under this chapter shall pay the tax with the sales price and shall deliver to the city director of finance and to the seller a written statement of protest within five working days of the sale that identifies the sale, rental or service that is the subject of the tax protested, the amount of tax paid, the buyer’s and seller’s name, mailing address and telephone number and the basis for the protest.
    2. The city director of finance, after investigation (if necessary) and after consultation with the city attorney, will rule on each protest and send to the buyer a notice that his claim has been allowed or disallowed within 30 days of receipt of the statement by the city. If the claim has been allowed, a refund will be remitted with the notice. In the event the claim is disallowed, the buyer may seek review thereof by the city manager within 30 days. Unless such review is sought within such time, the decision of the city director of finance is final. (Ord. 12-012 § 9, 2012; Ord. 10-019 § 11, 2010; Ord. 445 § 9, 1992; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.16)

3.16.170 Tax return – Extension of time.
The city manager may, in his discretion, upon written application duly made, grant an extension of time for filing returns and remitting the tax each month to any seller, provided:
A. That such extension is a dire necessity for bookkeeping reasons and would avert undue hardship upon such seller; and
B. That such seller is not delinquent in any payment of tax or filing of returns or otherwise in violation of this chapter; and
C. Provided further, that no such extension shall be for more than 21 days each month.
No such extension shall be made retroactive to cover existing delinquencies. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.17)

3.16.180 Estimated tax.
A. In the event that the city is unable to ascertain the tax due to be remitted by a seller by reason of seller’s failure to keep accurate books, to allow inspection, or to file a return or seller’s falsification of records, the city may make an estimate of the tax due based on any information available to it. Notice of the estimate of tax due shall be furnished the seller, and the amount therein stated shall become final 33 days thereafter for the purposes of determining liability of seller to the city, unless the seller earlier files an accurate return, supported by satisfactory records, indicating a lesser liability, or unless the city proves a greater liability within six years from the date the final estimate is established. A seller shall immediately notify the city of any fire, theft or other casualty which would prevent his complying with this chapter. Such casualty constitutes a defense to any penalty provided in this chapter, but does not excuse the seller from liability for taxes due. Accidental loss of funds or records is not a defense under this section.
B. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from filing and maintaining an action to collect any taxes collected or which should have been collected in addition to any penalty assessed. In such action, the estimated tax due made by the city shall be prima facie evidence of the amount payable. (Ord. 445 § 10, 1992; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.19)

3.16.190 Delinquent taxes – Notice.
A. Whenever any seller fails to submit the required return, or such return is reasonably believed by the city to contain incorrect reporting, the city may notify such seller in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested.
B. The seller shall have 15 days to provide evidence that the seller’s reporting is correct such as the seller’s books, sales receipts, papers, records and other memoranda pertaining to gross revenue and the determination of sales tax liability and in the event of noncompliance by the seller the city may forthwith take such legal action as provided for in this chapter. (Ord. 12-012 § 10, 2012; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.20)

3.16.200 Lien for tax, interest and administration costs and penalties.
A. The tax, interest, penalties and administrative costs imposed under this chapter shall constitute a lien in favor of the city upon the assets, including all real and personal property, of every person making taxable sales within the city. The lien arises upon delinquency and continues until the liability for the amount is satisfied or the property of the delinquent person is sold at foreclosure sales. When recorded, the sales tax lien has priority over all other liens except (1) liens for property taxes and special assessments; (2) liens that were perfected before the recording of the sales tax lien for amounts actually advanced before the recording of the sales tax lien; (3) mechanics’ and materialmen’s liens for which claims of lien under AS 34.35.070 or notices of right to lien under AS 34.35.064 have been recorded before the recording of the sales tax lien.
B. The city may file a notice of lien in the manner provided for federal tax liens under AS 40.19; provided, that in addition to the rights afforded thereunder, the city’s sales tax lien shall attach to all seller’s personal property, whether tangible or intangible, located in the recording district in which the lien is filed regardless of where the seller resides. The city may record subsequent notices of lien for amounts due after the recording of a previous notice of lien. The city may also record amended notices of lien to correct any errors or to provide notice of the then current principal amount owing.
C. The notice of lien for real property shall set out:
    1. The name of the seller;
    2. The principal amount owing at a stated date; and
    3. A statement that penalty, interest and administration costs are also owing.
D. Within 10 days after filing the notice of lien or amended notice of lien, the city shall mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of seller; provided failure to so mail the copy shall not void the lien nor lessen its priority. (Ord. 445 § 11, 1992; Ord. 334 § 3, 1986; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.21)

3.16.210 Delinquent taxes – Foreclosure – Time limit.
The city attorney, at the request of the city council, may file an action to foreclose the lien of the city for the tax upon property and rights to property, real or personal, and sell the same, applying the proceeds thereof to the payment of the tax, interest, penalty, administration costs and the costs of foreclosure. The action shall be commenced and pursued in the manner provided for the foreclosure of liens by AS 09.45.170 through 09.45.220; provided, however, upon commencement, the city shall provide written notice of the action to all persons having an interest of record in the property being foreclosed or persons in possession of the property. The action may be commenced at any time within six years after the lien arises. (Ord. 335 § 3, 1986; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.22)

3.16.220 Delinquent taxes – Foreclosure – Sale of property – Redemption.
A. The city council may collect taxes, with interest and penalties, by distraint, seizure and private sale of the property of the seller who fails to pay them within 10 days after service or mailing of the notice of delinquency. The council may levy upon, or, by warrant issued by it, authorize any peace officer to levy upon, seize or sell all property, except that upon which the seller claims an exemption pursuant to law, belonging to the seller, for the payment of the amount due, with interest and penalty for nonpayment, and also of a further amount sufficient for the fees, costs and expenses of the levy.
B. When distraint is made as provided in this section, the peace officer charged with the collection shall make or have made an account of the property distrained, a copy of which, signed by owner or possessor of the property, or at his dwelling or usual place of business, if a person of suitable age and discretion can be found, or if the taxpayer is a corporation or other type of organization, then with an officer, manager, general agent, or agent for process, with a note as to the amount demanded and the time and place of sale. The peace officer shall immediately publish a notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the property distrained, in a newspaper published in the city and, in the discretion of the council, have the notice publicly posted in three public places within five miles of the place where the sale is to be held, one of the notices to be posted at the post office nearest the place where the sale is to be made. The time of sale shall be not less than 10 nor more than 60 days from the date of the notification to the owner or possessor of the property, and the place proposed for the sale shall not be more than five miles from the place of making the distraint. The sale may be adjourned from time to time by the peace officer if he considers it advisable, but not for more than 90 days in all. When the property is advertised for sale under the distraint, the peace officer making the seizure shall proceed to sell the property at public auction, offering the property for sale at not less than a fair minimum price as established by the city manager, to the highest cash bidder, but reserving the right, if the amount bid is less than the fair minimum price so established, to declare the property to be purchased by him for the city. Property so purchased by him may thereafter be sold under regulations prescribed by the city, or otherwise used for city purposes.
C. The property distrained shall be restored to the owner or possessor if, before the sale, payment of the amount due is made to the peace officer charged with the collection, together with the fees and other charges; but in case of nonpayment, the peace officer shall proceed to sell the property at public auction. The owner of real property sold under this section, his heir, executor, administrator or successor or a person in his behalf may redeem the real property sold or a particular tract of the real property at any time within two years after the sale thereof; the property or tract may be redeemed upon payment to the purchaser or, if be cannot be found, then to the city for the use of the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, the amount paid by the purchaser and interest on it at the rate of eight percent per year. In the case of property sold, the peace officer conducting the sale shall give to the purchaser a certificate of sale on payment in full of the purchase price. In the case of real property, the certificate shall set out the real property purchased, the amount of taxes for which the same was sold, the name of the purchaser and the price paid for it. In the case of real property sold under this section and not redeemed in the manner and within the time provided in this chapter, the city manager shall execute to the purchaser of the real property at the sale a tax deed to the real property so purchased by him, reciting the facts set forth in the certificate. Such tax deed shall be delivered to the purchaser (including the city when it is the purchaser) upon demand after the period of redemption has expired. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.23)

3.16.230 Certificate of sale – Other than real property.
In all cases of sale of property under this chapter, other than real property, the certificate of sale:
A. Is prima facie evidence of the right of the peace officer to make the sale, and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his proceedings in making the sale;
B. Transfers to the purchaser all right, title and interest of the delinquent in and to the property sold;
C. When the property consists of shares of stock, is notice (when received) to the corporation, company, or association to record the transfer on their books and records in the same manner as if the stock were transferred or assigned by the party holding the stock in lieu of an original or prior certificate, which original or prior certificate is void, whether cancelled or not;
D. Where the subject of the sale is security or other evidence of debt, is a good and valid receipt to the person holding it, as against a person holding or claiming to hold possession of the security or other evidence of debt. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.24)

3.16.240 Certificate of sale – Real property.
In the case of a sale of real property under this chapter:
A. The deed of sale given under the provisions of this chapter is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in it; and
B. The deed is considered and operates as a conveyance of all the right, title and interest that the party delinquent had in and to the real property sold as of the time of the lien of the city attached to it. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.25)

3.16.250 Delinquent taxes – Seizure of additional property – Chapter nonexclusive.
If property seized and sold under distraint is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the city for which distraint or seizure is made, the peace officer may, thereafter, and as often as is necessary, proceed to seize and sell in like manner any other property liable to seizure of the delinquent party against whom the claim exists until the amount due from the delinquent party, together with all expenses, is fully paid. A person in possession of property or rights to property which is subject to distraint upon which a levy is made shall, upon demand by the peace officer making the levy, surrender the property or rights to the peace officer, unless the property or right is, at the time of the demand, subject to a previous attachment under judicial process. A person who fails or refuses to so surrender the property or rights is personally liable to the city in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of the taxes, penalty, interest and costs. All persons shall, on demand of a peace officer about to distrain or having distrained on property, or rights of property, exhibit all books containing evidence or statements relating to the subject of distraint or the property or rights of property liable to distraint for the tax due. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive but are in addition to all other existing remedies provided by law for the enforcement of a levy and collection of taxes of the city. (Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.26)

3.16.260 Violation – Remedies.
A. The seller who fails to timely remit sales tax to the city shall pay the city all costs of collection, to include without limitation, actual reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and audit fees incurred for collection, whether or not court action is commenced. This amount of fees and costs is in addition to the fee set out in subsection (C) of this section.
B. Each of the following acts or omissions, when intentional, constitutes an ordinance violation and subjects the violator to a civil penalty. Such an act or omission is intentional when it continues after notice from the city to the seller or seller’s agent that such act or omission is an ordinance violation. Each act or omission set forth in this section constitutes a separate violation, and each day that a violation of this chapter continues constitutes a separate violation:
    1. Failure to obtain a current business license by a seller;
    2. Making sales either without a current, valid business license or while the seller’s business license is suspended;
    3. Failure to file a sales tax return or failure to remit sales taxes when due;

    5. Failure to correct a falsification or misrepresentation of any record or fact provided to the city concerning sales tax;
    6. Failure of a seller to allow the inspection at reasonable times of records required to be kept by this chapter; and

D. The city may request the court to enjoin a seller from violating any provision of this chapter. On application for injunctive relief and a finding of a violation or threatened violation, the superior court shall grant the injunction.
E. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to those existing at law or equity. (Ord. 14-024 § 5, 2014; Ord. 07-029 § 13, 2007; Ord. 536 § 3, 1998; Ord. 452 § 3, 1992; Ord. 445 § 12, 1992; Ord. 199 § 1, 1977; 1978 code § 13.18)

A. If, through error or otherwise, a taxpayer pays to the city sales taxes to which the city is not entitled by law, the taxpayer may, within one year from the due date of the tax, apply in writing to the city director of finance for a refund.
B. If the application for refund of tax, and where applicable interest at eight percent per annum as well, does not exceed in the aggregate $500.00, the city director of finance may, upon approval by the city attorney and an audit of the applicant’s account, refund to the applicant the said tax, and, where applicable, interest as well.
C. If the city director of finance determines a refund is not due or is not due in the amount claimed, then the taxpayer may appeal to the city manager within 30 days as provided in PMC 3.16.280.
D. The procedure set forth in this section is the recognized procedure whereby a refund may be made; and the taxpayer must first duly comply with this section and PMC 3.16.280 as conditions precedent to bringing a suit to recover said taxes. Any person who has not timely availed himself of these procedures shall be deemed to have waived any right to such refund as well as the right to recover said tax and interest.
E. Any claim for refund shall be filed with the city director of finance within one year from the date of payment of the tax. The failure to file a claim for refund within the time allowed shall forever bar the claim. (Ord. 15-022 § 4, 2015; Ord. 10-019 § 12, 2010; Ord. 445 § 13, 1992)

The city shall have and may exercise all rights and powers in the acquisition, ownership and holding of real property as if the city were a private person; provided, however, the city shall not waive any immunities of a municipality regarding the acquisition, ownership and holding of real property unless specifically provided for by resolution concerning the specific property.
F. Dedication by Plat. The city may not acquire any real property by means of a dedication by plat unless the dedication of the real property is accepted in writing and signed by the mayor.
G. Procedure. 
    1. The city may acquire real property and the council shall approve by resolution the acquisition of real property to be purchased in whole or in part for a cash consideration or exchange of real property.
    2. No approval is necessary to acquire any easement, right-of-way, permit, license, or other interest in real property if necessary for a utility or public improvement where the utility or public improvement has been authorized and approved by the council.
    3. Prior to approval, the city manager shall furnish the council with an abstract of title, or preliminary commitment for title insurance, the value assessed by the borough tax assessor or other appraisal of the real property, and a review of any problems in acquisition, but the failure to furnish the council any such material shall not affect the validity of any acquisition or purchase of real property by the city.
    4. Unless otherwise provided by the council, the city shall purchase marketable title in the real property.
H. Purchase by Agreement. The council may approve and authorize the purchase of real property by contract of sale, deed of trust, or mortgage.

J. Federal and State Aid. Legislative assent to federal or state aid for the city, including aid given to the city through a department or agency of the federal or state government, is given.

(Ord. 11-004 § 3, 2011; Ord. 246 § 3, 1982)

3.20.080 Sale or disposition of real property.
A. Authority to Sell or Dispose of Property. The city may sell, convey, exchange, transfer, donate, dedicate, direct or assign to use, or otherwise dispose of city-owned real property by any lawful means or conveyances.
B. Form of Sale or Disposition. The city may sell or dispose of real property by warranty or quitclaim deed, easement, grant, permit, license, deed of trust, mortgage, contract of sale of real property, plat dedication, lease, tax deed, will, or any other lawful method or mode of conveyance or grant. Any instrument requiring execution by the city shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk. The form of any instrument shall be approved by the city attorney.
C. Rights and Powers. The city shall have and may exercise all rights and powers in the sale and disposal of real property as if the city were a private person; provided, however, the city shall not waive any immunities of a municipality regarding the sale or disposition of real property unless specifically provided for by resolution concerning the specific sale or disposition. The city may sell or dispose of any real property, including property acquired or held for or devoted to a public use, when in the judgment of the city council it is no longer required for municipal purposes.
D. Public and Charitable Conveyances. The council may sell, donate or exchange with the United States, the state, any political subdivision, or a nonprofit organization, city-owned real property without a public sale and for less than the fair market value, whenever in the judgment of the city council it is advantageous to the city to make the conveyance.
E. Property Exchanges. The council may approve, after public notice, the conveyance and exchange of a parcel of city property for an equivalent parcel of property owned by another person, subject to such conditions as the council may impose on the exchange, whenever in the judgment of the city council it is advantageous to the city to make the property exchange.
F. Grants for Federal and State Programs. The council may grant or devote real property no longer held for public purpose to the United States, the state of Alaska, a local subdivision, or an agency of any of these governments, for a consideration agreed upon between the city and the grantee without a public sale if the grant or devotion is advantageous to the city. Any approval of a federal or state program providing for the participation or cooperation of the city by grant or devotion of the real property is a sale of that real property for the consideration stated in the program.
G. Industrial Sites. Notwithstanding any other subsections of this section, the city may sell, lease or dispose of sites acquired for new industries benefiting the city upon the terms and conditions as the city council considers advantageous to the civic welfare of the city, to a person who agrees to install, maintain and operate a beneficial new industry.
H. Change of Use. Real property acquired or purchased for one city purpose may be appropriated, transferred, assigned, or directed without public sale to another city purpose, whenever the city council determines that the purpose for which the property was acquired or purchased no longer exists, or the property is no longer used or useful for the purpose. No formal conveyance is necessary to dispose of the real property to another city purpose, and the disposition may be made to another purpose with or without legal consideration for the disposition. The city may sell, convey or otherwise dispose of real property no longer used or useful in the operation of a city-owned utility. Real property no longer needed for the purpose for which the real property was acquired or purchased, or utility property no longer used or useful in the operation of a city-owned utility, is no longer property owned, held for or devoted to a public use, and may be sold or disposed of as provided in this chapter if the council determines the real property is not useful to the city for any other purpose.
I. Conveyance of Public Improvement Property Interests. The city council may at any time, without public sale, convey, quitclaim, release, cancel, or otherwise relinquish any real property easement, right-of-way, permit, or license the city may have or hold for the purpose of installing, constructing, or maintaining a public improvement, whenever the interest is no longer used or useful for that purpose.
J. Real Property as Security. The council may pledge, mortgage or otherwise secure city real property for the payment of city bonded or other indebtedness when required, as authorized by law.
K. Public Sale. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, real property no longer used or useful for a public use or purpose shall be sold to the highest responsible bidder at a public sale. Public sale shall not be required where the real property of the city is subject to any term or condition restricting or limiting the ability of the city to obtain the fair market value of the property.
L. Notice. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, notice of a proposed public sale of real property shall be published not less than two weeks prior to bid date in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall contain a description of the real property to be sold and the time, date, place and any terms or limitations of the public sale.
M. Fair Market Value. Real property shall be sold for not less than the fair market value. If a public sale does not result in a bid equal to or greater than the fair market value and costs of sale, the council may sell the real property at a private sale or may conduct another public sale. In the event of an authorized private sale or another public sale, the council may approve the sale of the property at the highest price which may be obtained. “Fair market value” as used in this subsection means the price determined in terms of money at which the real property is appraised by a qualified appraiser, or the value assessed by the borough tax assessor.
N. Procedure on Public Sale. The council in the resolution authorizing the sale of real property shall set forth the terms and conditions of the public sale. The council may reserve the right to reject any and all bids received at the public sale, if the highest bid is below the fair market value and costs of sale or is not made by a responsible bidder. The resolution shall provide if the sale is for cash, or cash deposit and a purchase agreement. If the sale is for a cash deposit and a purchase agreement, the city manager shall prescribe the form of the purchase agreement. No sale or purchase agreement will be enforceable against the city unless and until the city council approves such sale or purchase agreement. The approval of any public sale by the council authorizes the city manager to take all steps and execute all instruments to complete and close the sale. The city manager shall conduct the sale, and shall give to the bidder at the auction a receipt for all moneys received by the city. A purchaser at a public sale who fails to make such other cash payments within the times required by the resolution shall forfeit any cash deposit paid to the city.
O. Appraisal. No real property shall be sold at a public sale unless the real property to be sold has been appraised by a qualified appraiser within 180 days prior to the date of the resolution authorizing the public sale.
P. Council Action. No action of the council to dispose of any city interest in real property dedicated to public use shall be final until the resolution to do so has been on file in the office of the city clerk for 30 days. Prior to any council action on the sale of real property, the city manager shall make his recommendation to the city council as to any change of use or merits of the sale or disposition of the real property.
Q. Purchase Agreement. A purchaser of real property from the city may purchase the real property by purchase agreement if provided in the resolution for the sale. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution for the sale, a purchase agreement shall provide for a deed, note and deed of trust. The purchase agreement shall be executed by the mayor, attested by the city clerk and approved as to form by the city attorney.
R. Broker. The city may employ a broker for the sale of real property and may pay the broker a commission for the sale. The employment shall be in the resolution for the sale of the real property and any contract of employment shall be first approved by the city council unless the city council authorized the city manager to execute the contract without approval.
S. Easements and Rights-of-Way. The city may reserve any easement and right-of-way to be used for public improvements and purposes before selling or disposing of city-owned real property. The city council may make such restrictions, limitations, reservations, reversions, or other covenants the council may find advantageous to the city even if the fair market value of the property is affected. The effect of these reservations may be considered in determining the fair market value of the property.
T. City Manager Regulations. The city manager may provide by regulation for the procedures and forms as to applications, surveys, appraisals, auction, bidding, form or substance of purchase agreement, or any other matter involving the sale or disposition of city property not inconsistent with and to implement the intent and purpose of this chapter. The absence of a regulation or an inconsistent resolution shall not invalidate any public sale procedure, or conveyance executed or to be executed by the city, where the requirements of this chapter have been otherwise satisfied. (Ord. 544 § 3, 1999; Ord. 246 § 3, 1982)

3.20.090 Leasing of real property.
A. Property Available for Leasing. All real property which the city owns, or in which the city has right, title and interest, or to which the city may become entitled, may be leased as provided in this chapter. The term “property” as used in this chapter shall include these interests in real property.
B. Term. No lease shall be for a term of more than 20 years unless the council shall determine from the purpose, use of the premises, and nature of improvements which may be placed thereon that a longer term would benefit the city and would be consistent with city planning. A lease shall first be approved by the city council. Any renewal period or option to renew the lease period shall be included in the term of the lease.
C. Appraisals. 
    1. Property in General. No property shall be leased or a renewal lease issued unless the property to be leased has been appraised by the city within one year prior to the date contemplated for the commencement of the lease, unless the council, in its discretion, determines that an appraisal is unnecessary.
    2. Airport Properties. Airport properties shall be leased in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements associated with aeronautical and nonaeronautical uses and may be appraised by the city when it is determined that it is in the best interests of the airport to do so.
D. Lease Auction. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, property shall be leased to the highest bidder at a lease auction.
E. Notice. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, notice of a proposed lease of property shall be published not less than two weeks prior to bid opening date in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall set forth a description of the property with interest therein to be leased, and the time, place, and any terms or limitations of the lease auction. Notice shall not be required if the term of the lease is two years or less. Where the lease contains a provision permitting the renewal, extension or modification of the lease, notice is not required for the renewal, the exercise of the option or the modification. The council may waive the requirement of public notice and auction for a lease of property on which substantial improvements are to be placed, or have been placed, when the council, in its discretion, determines from the circumstances of the transaction, the size, location, nature, rentals, terms, proposed use and purpose of the property that a negotiated lease of the property would not substantially affect the fair rental value of the property.
F. Fair Rental Value. Except as provided in subsection (C)(2) of this section, property shall be leased for a fair rental value. “Fair rental value” is the rental computed from the appraised fair rental value of the property and shall mean the highest price described in terms of money for which the property would rent, if exposed for rent for a reasonable time in the open market, for the use permitted by the city. With approval by the city council, the lease of property may be made for a rental less than the fair rental value to a state or federal agency, state political subdivision or nonprofit organization as may be determined by the city manager to be fair and proper, considering the public interest and the nature of the public use or function of the leased premises. Fair rental value shall not be required where the property interest of the city is subject to any term or condition restricting or limiting the ability of the city to obtain the fair rental value of the property.
G. Adjustment of Rental. A lease having a term of more than two years shall provide for adjustment of rentals at specified intervals during the term of lease, and the intervals shall be every five years. This section shall be incorporated in each lease by reference and enforceable as if fully set forth therein.
H. Renewal of Lease. The renewal or extension of the lease shall be considered as a new lease unless renewal or extension is provided for in the lease.
I. Improvements and Chattels. The lease shall provide the terms, conditions and limitations of the removal or reversion of improvements or chattels upon the lease premises after termination of the lease. The retiring lessee may, with the consent of the city manager, sell the improvements to the succeeding lessee. If the improvements or chattels are not removed within the time set forth in the lease, the improvements and chattels may, upon reasonable notice to the lessee, be sold at public sale to be provided by regulations of the city manager. Proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the city’s costs and expenses of maintaining, removing and selling the improvements and chattels and to rentals for the period of nonremoval. The city may bid at the sale and may be credited with the value of the city’s costs, expenses and rentals due resulting from the nonremoval of the improvements or chattels. The city shall have all other rights, both legal and equitable, any other purchaser would have or acquire by reason of the sale. In addition, should the lease so provide, if the improvements or chattels are not removed within the time set forth in the lease, the improvements and chattels may become the property of the city.
J. Inspection. The lessee shall allow an authorized representative of the city to enter the leased premises for inspection at any reasonable time.
K. Easements and Rights-of-Way. The city expressly reserves the right, without compensation or adjustment in rentals to the lessee, to grant surface, underground or overhead utility easements or rights-of-way in or upon the leased property, if the exercise of the right will not unreasonably interfere with lessee’s improvements placed upon the property and with the lessee’s use of the property.
L. Condemnation. Upon condemnation of the premises or any part thereof by the state, borough, or federal government or agency thereof, including inverse condemnation, the lease shall terminate without any liability to the city. The city shall not be liable in damages or pay any compensation to the lessee as a result of the condemnation terminating the lease.
M. City Manager Regulations. The city manager may provide by regulations for the procedures and form as to applications, surveys, appraisals, auction, bidding, form and substance of lease, termination, forfeiture or any other matter involving the leasing of city property to implement the intent and purpose of this chapter. The absence of a regulation shall not invalidate any auction procedure or lease executed or to be executed by the city, where the requirements of the chapter have been otherwise satisfied.
N. Approval of City Council. The city council shall approve all leases. All leases shall be approved as to form by the city attorney prior to execution. (Ord. 12-008 § 3, 2012; Ord. 246 § 3, 1982)

At the pre-bid conference or at other times deemed appropriate by the purchasing officer, the terms of an invitation for bids may be modified or interpreted only by written addenda issued by the purchasing officer.

The tabulation shall be open to public inspection, and a copy of the tabulation shall be furnished to each bidder upon request.
F. Bids shall be accepted unconditionally without alteration or correction. For purposes of determining the low bidder and the responsiveness of bids, no criteria except those set forth in the invitation for bids, including all specifications and addenda, may be used. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.180 Award to be made only to qualified and responsible bidder submitting a responsive bid.
A contract award under this chapter shall be made only to a qualified and responsible bidder submitting a responsive bid. The purchasing officer shall determine whether a bidder is qualified and responsible on the basis of the following criteria:
A. The skill and experience demonstrated by the bidder in performing contracts of a similar nature.
B. The bidder’s record for honesty and integrity.
C. The bidder’s capacity to perform in terms of facilities, personnel and financing.
D. The bidder’s past performance under city contracts. If the bidder has failed in any material way to perform its obligations under any contract with the city, the bidder may be deemed a nonresponsible bidder.
E. At all times the best interests of the city shall be recognized in awarding bids. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.190 Procedures for award.
A. At least five calendar days before council approval, the city will send notice to bidders of notice of intent to award the contract. Notice will be sent by fax if available to the three lowest bidders.
B. Contracts shall be awarded by written notice issued by the purchasing officer to the qualified and responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid.
C. The city manager may reject any or all bids if he or she determines that it is in the best interests of the city.
D. If the lowest responsive bid from a qualified and responsible bidder exceeds the amount of funds certified by the finance director to be available for the procurement, and if sufficient additional funds are not made available, the scope of the procurement may be reduced to bring its estimated cost within the amount of available funds. The purchasing officer shall issue a new invitation for bids for the reduced procurement, or, upon a finding that the efficient operation of the city government requires that the contract be awarded without delay, the purchasing officer may negotiate with the qualified and responsive bidder providing the lowest bid or up to the three qualified and responsible bidders providing the three lowest responsive bids, and may award or recommend to the council for award the reduced contract to the best negotiated proposal. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.200 Waiver of irregularities.
The council, or city manager for bids of $50,000 or less, shall have the authority to waive irregularities on any and all bids, except that timeliness and manual signature requirements shall not be waived. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.210 Competitive sealed proposals – Negotiated procurement.
A. If the purchasing officer determines that use of competitive sealed bidding is not practicable, not the most advantageous procurement method for the city, or not in the city’s best interest, the city may procure supplies, services, or construction by competitive sealed proposals under this section. For purposes of this section, construction includes, by way of example and not limitation, design-build, design-build-operate-maintain, or design-build-finance-operate-maintain project delivery methods.
B. The purchasing officer shall solicit competitive sealed proposals by issuing a request for proposals. The request for proposals shall state, or incorporate by reference, all specifications and contractual terms and conditions to which a proposal must respond, and shall state the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and the relative importance of those factors. Public notice of a request for proposals shall be given as deemed appropriate by the purchasing officer. One or more preproposal conferences may be held by the purchasing officer or designee. A request for proposals may be modified or interpreted only in written addenda issued by the purchasing officer.
C. Sealed proposals shall be designated as such on an outer envelope and shall be submitted by mail or in person at the place and no later than the time specified in the request for proposals. Proposals not submitted at the place or within the time so specified shall not be opened or considered.
D. Proposals shall be received at the time and place designated in the request for proposals, and shall be opened so as to avoid disclosing their contents to competing proposers during the evaluation, discussion, and negotiation process. Notwithstanding public records requirements, the contents of the proposals, tabulations and evaluations thereof shall be open to public inspection only after council approval of a contract award. However, the purchasing officer shall issue a notice of intent to award to all responding proposers at least five calendar days prior to council approval. Upon request by a competing proposer, the recommended awardee’s proposal shall be opened for review. The review by a competing proposer is to assure reasonable access and opportunity to request a debriefing from the purchasing officer prior to council action on the proposed award. If an award does not require council approval, public inspection shall not be allowed until seven days after the purchasing officer has issued a notice of intent to award and there are no pending reviews or actions from any competing proposer.
E. As provided in the request for proposals, the purchasing officer may enter into discussions with responsible proposers whose proposals are determined by the purchasing officer to be most reasonably responsive to the request for proposals (short-listed firms). The purchasing officer may issue an interim notice to the remaining firms that a qualified short list has been established for discussion purposes. No disclosure of the contents of proposals, tabulations or evaluations thereof shall be made in accordance with subsection (D) of this section. Discussions shall be used to clarify and ensure full understanding of the requirements of the request for proposals. The purchasing officer may permit those short-listed firms to revise their proposals after submission and prior to award to obtain best and final offers. Proposers deemed eligible for discussions shall be treated equally regarding any opportunity to discuss and revise proposals. However, if during the discussions it is evident that the proposals, as submitted, will exceed the available funding, and/or other changes in the terms, conditions, or requirements are needed to clarify or fulfill the requirements of the city, the purchasing officer shall issue a written modification to those short-listed firms with an established date and time for the firms to respond. The failure of a short-listed firm to respond or to notify the purchasing officer of a needed time extension may be just cause to remove the proposer from further consideration. In conducting discussions or requesting revisions, neither the purchasing officer nor any other city officer or employee shall disclose any information derived from other competing proposals.
F. If fair and reasonable compensation, contract requirements and contract documents can be agreed upon with the most qualified proposer, the contract may be awarded to that firm and no other firm.
G. If fair and reasonable compensation, contract requirements and contract documents cannot be agreed upon with the most qualified proposer, the purchasing officer shall advise the proposer of the termination of negotiations. If the proposals were submitted by one or more other proposers determined to be qualified, negotiations may be conducted with such other proposers in the order of their respective rankings. The contract may be awarded to the proposer then determined to be most advantageous to the city.
H. After the notice of intent to award referred to in subsection (D) of this section, the award shall be made by written notice to the proposer whose final proposal is determined to be most advantageous to the city. No criteria other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in proposal evaluation. If the city manager determines that it is in the best interest of the city to do so, the city may reject all proposals. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.220 Open market procedure.
A. The purchasing officer may procure all budgeted supplies, services, professional services and construction having an estimated value of not more than $50,000 on the open market without formal advertising or other formal bid procedures, but subject to the following.
B. For procurements under this section over $5,000, whenever practicable, at least three informal bids or quotations shall be solicited and a record kept thereof. The solicitation may be either oral or written, and shall be in a form reasonably calculated to yield the lowest responsive bid by a responsible bidder. In addition, for any procurement under this section over $15,000, the solicitation and acceptance must be in writing. As required by PMC 3.21.100, all contracts must be signed by the city manager or acting city manager.
C. Awards, where practicable, shall be made to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid. The purchasing officer shall keep a record of all open market bids received and awards made thereon.
D. All contract awards under this section, and any amendments thereto, shall be subject to the applicable approval requirements of PMC 3.21.090 prior to execution. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

    1. For contracts, including reimbursable agreements, with federal, state or local units of government or utility provider where the city has a financial responsibility or beneficial interest in entering into an agreement.
    2. For contracts issued pursuant to any federal, state, or local government contract where the city is an authorized user, or where the resulting contractor agrees to extend the same terms, conditions, and pricing to the city as those awarded under the original contract, all in accordance with PMC 3.21.240. Such agreements shall be limited to those contracts where the award is issued pursuant to a formally advertised solicitation.
    3. For contracts where the purchasing officer determines in writing that the city’s requirements reasonably limit the source for the supplies, services, professional service or construction to one person.
B. All contract awards under this section, and any amendments thereto, shall be subject to the applicable approval requirements of PMC 3.21.090 prior to execution.
C. No contractor may provide supplies, services, professional services, or construction to the city before the applicable requirements of this section are first satisfied. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.240 Joint purchasing.
A. The city manager, upon approval of the city council, may join with other units of government in cooperative purchasing ventures for the purchase of personal property to include bid extension, where the best interest of the city would be served thereby, provided such other unit of government uses competitive bidding on the item purchased. The property to be purchased must be budgeted and substantially meet or exceed the city requirements for a similar item.
B. The city manager, upon approval of the city council, may join with other units of government in the cooperative purchasing of professional services and products, where the best interest of the city is served. The professional service or product must be budgeted and substantially meet or exceed the city requirements for a similar service or product.
C. The city manager, upon approval of the city council, may purchase personal or real property from other governmental agencies, without competition, provided the manager presents to the council a writing describing the transaction, including a description of the property and its price.
D. The other units of government may be outside of Alaska, to include other municipalities, states, and the federal government. If for a federal government purchase the point of purchase or contract is outside of Alaska or if the unit of nonfederal government is outside of Alaska, then the bidder must agree (1) to have venue in Palmer, Alaska, for any dispute arising out of or related to the purchase or to the good or service provided, (2) to have the laws of the state of Alaska apply to all disputes arising out of or related to the purchase or to the good or service provided, and (3) to have the laws of no state other than the state of Alaska apply to all disputes arising out of or related to the purchase or to the good or service provided. If the goods are reasonably expected to require service over their lifetime, the bidder must certify that there is a service center for the goods within 50 miles of Palmer; provided, that this requirement may be omitted by the city manager for good cause in writing. In addition, the bidder must agree to ship the goods FOB Palmer, Alaska, at the best shipping rate available providing for a reasonable delivery time, which shipping rate and time must be preapproved by the city manager. The bidder must agree that the city will bear only that portion of the shipping costs FOB Palmer that exceed the shipping costs to the point of delivery under the contract with the other unit of government. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.250 Emergency procurements.
The city may award a contract for supplies, services, professional services or construction without competition, formal advertising or other formal procedure where the city manager determines in writing that an emergency threatening the public health, safety or welfare requires that the contract be awarded without delay. The city manager shall make a report on such contract to the council no later than the next regular meeting following award of the contract. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.260 Professional services.
A. Except as authorized by PMC 3.21.230 or 3.21.250, professional services shall be procured in accordance with the terms of this section.
B. Persons interested in providing professional services for the city may submit statements of qualifications to the city manager.
C. Notice of the need for professional services shall be given as deemed appropriate by the city manager. The notice shall describe the services required and shall list the type of information and data required of each person submitting a proposal. The notice shall state the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals and the relative importance of those factors.
D. The department head and city manager may conduct discussions with any person who has submitted a proposal to determine the person’s qualifications for further consideration. Discussions shall not disclose any information derived from proposals submitted by other persons.
E. Award shall be made to the person determined by the city manager, in consultation with the department head, to be the best qualified, and shall be for an amount of compensation determined to be fair and reasonable. If compensation cannot be agreed upon with the best qualified person, negotiations shall be formally terminated with that person. If proposals were submitted by one or more other persons determined to be qualified, negotiations may be conducted with the persons, in order of their respective qualification ranking. The contract may be awarded to the person then ranked as best qualified if the amount of compensation is determined to be fair and reasonable.
F. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, legal services may be procured by direct negotiation with an attorney or law firm qualified to handle the type of legal problems presented. No negotiations or contract for services of legal counsel may be pursued without the prior approval in writing of the city manager. (Ord. 644 § 4, 2004)

3.21.270 Bonds.
A. Bid Bonds. The purchasing officer may require that persons submitting bids pursuant to this chapter accompany their bids with a bid bond in an amount and in a form acceptable to the purchasing officer. The bond shall be issued by a company qualified by law to do business as a surety in the state, or shall be in the form of a cashier’s check from a bank with a branch in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough or the municipality of Anchorage. A condition of the bond shall be that, if the bidder receives the award, the bidder shall enter into a contract therefor with the city.
B. Performance and Payment Bonds. If a requirement for a performance and payment bond is included in the terms of the invitation to bid or request for proposals, the purchasing officer may require that any person awarded a city contract furnish such bond, issued by a company qualified by law to do business as a surety in the state. The bond shall be in an amount determined by the purchasing officer and in a form approved by the city attorney. Such bonds shall, at a minimum, guarantee the full and faithful performance of all contract obligations and payment for all labor and materials to be used under the contract.

The city establishes these administrative review procedures for bid protests to promote the fair and efficient resolution of such disputes over contracts awarded by the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter regarding bids and requests for proposals. Bid protest procedures are established to ensure the integrity of the public bidding process. Time is of the essence in any bid protest. All bid documents the city issues shall be deemed to contain language advising bidders of the right to protest the determination of the successful bid as set out in this section. (For purposes of this section, the term “bidder” includes the term “proposer,” the term “bid” includes the term “proposal,” and the term “intended awardee” means the bidder named in the purchasing officer’s notice of intent to award.)
B. Time Lines for Protests. A protest based on alleged improprieties or ambiguities in an invitation to bid or a request for proposals must be filed with the purchasing officer at least 10 days before the due date of the bid or proposal. Failure to meet this time line shall constitute a waiver of the protesting party’s rights and a bar on any further action regarding this matter. A protest based upon alleged improprieties in an intended award of a contract must be filed with the purchasing officer with a copy previously served upon the intended awardee within two business days after a notice of intent to award the contract is issued. Failure to meet this time line shall constitute a waiver of the protesting party’s rights and a bar on any further action regarding this matter.
C. Bid Protest. The bid protest shall be in writing on a form provided by the purchasing officer. The protest shall include the following:
    1. The name, address, telephone number, and continuously operating fax number of the protester;
    2. Identification of the invitation or request at issue;
    3. A detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest, including copies of relevant documents;
    4. The form of relief requested;
    5. Certification under oath that the claim is made in good faith and that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the bidder’s knowledge and belief; and
    6. The signature of the protester or the protester’s representative.
If the protest is not timely or does not meet the requirements of this subsection (C), it shall be denied.
D. Purchasing Officer Decision. The purchasing officer shall conduct a review in consultation with the city attorney. Within three business days of receipt of the bid protest, unless the purchasing officer needs more time, the purchasing officer shall issue a determination. The determination shall be in writing, supported by findings and conclusions addressing the issues raised in the bid protest. The decision shall include a statement substantially as follows:This is the final decision of the purchasing officer. This decision may be appealed. If you appeal, you must deliver your appeal, along with $250, to the city clerk within three business days after service by fax or otherwise of the purchasing officer’s decision.
The determination shall be served on the bid protester and the intended awardee by fax and U.S. mail.
E. Stay of Award. If a protest is filed, the award may be made unless the purchasing officer determines in writing that a:
    1. Reasonable probability exists that the protest will be sustained; or
    2. Stay of the award is not contrary to the best interests of the city.
The purchasing officer is under no duty to stay the award.
F. Protest Remedies. 
    1. If the purchasing officer sustains a protest in whole or in part, the purchasing officer shall implement an appropriate remedy.
    2. In determining an appropriate remedy, the purchasing officer shall consider the circumstances surrounding the solicitation or procurement including the seriousness of the procurement deficiencies, the degree of prejudice to other interested parties or to the integrity of the procurement system, the good faith of the parties, the extent the procurement has been accomplished, costs to the city and other impacts on the city of a proposed remedy, and the urgency of the procurement to the welfare of the city.
    3. Notwithstanding subsections (F)(1) and (2) of this subsection, if a protest is sustained in whole or part, the protester’s damages are limited to reasonable bid or proposal preparation costs.
G. Notice of Appeal. The bid protester or intended awardee may appeal the purchasing officer’s decision on a bid protest as follows:
    1. Time Line for Filing an Appeal. An appeal must be received by the clerk’s office within three business days after service by fax or otherwise upon appellant of the purchasing officer’s decision along with a filing fee in the amount of $250.00. Failure to file and submit the fee within three business days shall result in an appeal being denied as untimely without further process and shall constitute a waiver of the protesting party’s rights and a bar on any further action.
    2. Procedure for Filing. An appeal shall be filed on a form provided by the clerk. The clerk’s form shall require the party to provide the following information:

A. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the procedures for handling pass-through grants, which are governed by AS 37.05.315. The procedures are designed to minimize any liability or loss to the city which may arise from administering said grants, while at the same time maximizing the amount of said grant funds going to the purposes of the grants.
B. Loss or liability may arise out of the following: administrative costs, loss of interest, ineligible expenditures, and the grantee’s failure to perform. Most administrative costs can be determined soon after the completion of construction or of the grant project. Ineligible expenditures can be determined only after a state audit. A grantee’s failure to perform can only be determined after a term equal to the practical life of the facility constructed with the grant funds. (Ord. 449 § 3, 1992)

C. “Grant agreement” means the contract document, including but not limited to rules, regulations and laws, pertaining to the grant between the city and the grantee. (Ord. 470 § 3, 1993; Ord. 449 § 3, 1992)

3.24.030 General provisions.
A. The city council may authorize the mayor or city manager to enter into grant agreements with grantees which set forth the terms and conditions of the grant and its administration.
B. The grant agreement with a grantee shall set forth all terms and conditions for administering the grant including but not limited to scope of work, payment and process schedule, State of Alaska Municipal Grant Agreement, and such security devices as are deemed reasonable by the city manager.
C. Grant funds are not to be disbursed until the city and grantee have entered into a grant agreement. (Ord. 449 § 3, 1992)

3.24.040 Grant administration fee schedule.
To administer grants, the city shall retain fees from the grant funds computed as follows:

However, if 30 days’ notice is not possible, the employee shall provide such notice as soon as practicable.

(Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

B. When leave is to care for an injured or ill service member, an eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the service member. Leave to care for an injured or ill service member, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks in a single 12-month period.

F. Coordination with Other Leave. 
    1. An employee requesting family and medical leave shall first exhaust accrued annual personal leave before utilizing leave without pay.

In this chapter, “timely” means the grievance must be filed within 60 days of the grievable event. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.40.020 Procedure.
A. When an employee has a grievance, the employee shall timely present the grievance in writing to his or her immediate supervisor who shall endeavor to resolve it within five working days. If the supervisor is unable to do so the supervisor shall refer it to the department director who shall have five working days for the settlement of the grievance.
B. If the employee’s supervisor is a department director, then the department director shall have seven working days to settle the grievance. If not resolved at the department director level, the grievance shall be reported in writing to the personnel officer.
C. Once reported to the personnel officer or designee, the personnel officer or designee shall conduct an investigation. The decision on the findings shall be provided to the employee within 15 working days. If the grievance is not resolved at the personnel officer level, it shall be reported in writing along with the personnel officer’s findings and decision to the city manager who shall conduct an investigation and hearings as may be appropriate and report his or her findings and decision to the employee within 15 working days. The decision of the city manager shall be final.
D. In presenting grievances throughout the procedure, the aggrieved employee may have the assistance of any representatives as he or she considers desirable, at the employee’s expense. Any employee of the city having a work-related complaint is required to seek resolution of the complaint by following the procedures described in this section.
E. The intent of this procedure is to seek resolution of the complaint at the lowest level of the organization possible, to foster sound interpersonal relations between each level of the city’s departments, and to be supportive of open communication between supervisors and subordinates.
F. Once an employee has given notice of resignation or has been served with the notice of intent for adverse action according to Chapter 4.50 PMC, Disciplinary Action and Termination, their grievance rights cease. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

D. If the employee duly delivers a request for hearing, the department director’s imposition of adverse action is stayed pending decision by the hearing officer. The hearing officer will hold a hearing within five working days from date of receipt of the request. The hearing officer may extend in writing the hearing date, but no extension of more than 10 working days shall be granted. The hearing officer shall duly notify the employee of the date, time and place of the hearing.

    3. Acceptance of an appointment to any position, other than a temporary or part-time position, constitutes satisfaction of an employee’s reinstatement rights.
    4. A layoff of more than one year shall terminate the employee’s entitlement to preferential reinstatement rights.

The requirements may be waived by a department director where adequate provision can be made in a shorter period of time. All resignations shall be made in writing and presented to the department director. Failure to provide required notice shall result in a final appraisal stating the employee did not leave in good standing.
B. Upon receipt of two weeks’ notice the department director may elect to pay two weeks’ severance pay in lieu of employee’s service. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.50.100 Retirement.

4.50.110 COBRA notice.
A. Upon termination, the city or designee shall notify the employee of his or her right to extend the health plan coverage. This notice will be in accordance with COBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Under COBRA, if an employee terminates employment with the city of Palmer, the employee is entitled to continue participating in the city’s group health plan for a prescribed period of time, usually 18 months. (In certain circumstances, such as an employee’s divorce or death, the length of coverage period may be longer for qualified dependents.) COBRA coverage is not extended to employees terminated for gross misconduct.
B. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 provides an employee who is on military leave of absence will retain their health insurance coverage for the first 31 days of uniformed service. Employees on military leave of absence which extends beyond the 31 days will be eligible for COBRA benefits for up to 24 months.
C. If a former employee chooses to continue group benefits under COBRA, he/she must pay the total applicable premium plus a two percent administrative fee. Coverage will cease if the former employee fails to make premium payments as scheduled, becomes covered by another group plan that does not exclude pre-existing conditions or becomes eligible for Medicare.

4.70.010     Social media use policy.
4.70.020     Facebook standard policy.

4.70.005 Computer use policy.
The city shall institute a city-wide computer use policy. All employees are required to read and sign the computer use policy. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.70.010 Social media use policy.
A. Purpose. 
    1. To address the fast-changing landscape of the Internet and the way residents communicate and obtain information online, city departments may consider using social media tools to reach a broader audience. The city encourages the use of social media to further the goals of the city and the missions of its departments, where appropriate.
    2. The city has an overriding interest and expectation in deciding what is “spoken” on behalf of the city on social media sites. This policy establishes guidelines for the use of social media.
B. General. 
    1. All city social media sites posted by departments will be subject to approval by the city manager.
    2. The city’s website will remain the city’s primary and predominant Internet presence.
        a. The best, most appropriate city uses of social media tools fall generally into two categories:
            i. As channels for disseminating time-sensitive information as quickly as possible (example: emergency information).
            ii. As marketing/promotional channels which increase the city’s ability to broadcast its message to the widest possible audience.
        b. Wherever possible, content posted to city social media sites will also be available on the city’s website.
        c. Wherever possible, content posted to city social media sites should contain links directing users back to the city’s official website for in-depth information, forms, documents or online services necessary to conduct business with the city.
    3. As is the case for city’s website, departmental public staff will be responsible for the content and upkeep of any social media sites their department may create.
    4. All city social media sites shall comply with all appropriate city policies and standards.
    5. City social media sites are subject to the Alaska Public Records Act and Chapter 2.90 PMC.
        a. Any content maintained in a social media format that is related to city business, including a list of subscribers and posted communication, is a public record.
        b. The department maintaining the site is responsible for responding completely and accurately to any public records request for public records on social media.
        c. Content related to city business shall be maintained in an accessible format and so that it can be produced in response to a request (see the city Facebook policy).
        d. Wherever possible, such sites shall clearly indicate that any articles and any other content posted or submitted for posting are subject to public disclosure.
        e. Users shall be notified that public disclosure requests must be directed to the assigned departmental employee.
    6. City records retention schedules apply to social media formats and social media content. Unless otherwise addressed in a specific social media standards document, the department maintaining a site shall preserve records required to be maintained pursuant to a relevant records retention schedule for the required retention period on a city server in a format that preserves the integrity of the original record and is easily accessible.
    7. Users and visitors to social media sites shall be notified that the intended purpose of the site is to serve as a mechanism for communication between city departments and members of the public. City social media site articles and comments containing any of the following forms of content shall not be allowed:
        a. Comments not topically related to the particular social medium article being commented upon;
        b. Comments in support of or opposition to political campaigns or ballot measures;
        c. Profane language or content;
        d. Content that promotes, fosters, or perpetuates discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, age, religion, gender, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation;
        e. Sexual content or links to sexual content;
        f. Solicitations of commerce;
        g. Conduct or encouragement of illegal activity;
        h. Information that may tend to compromise the safety or security of the public or public systems; or
        i. Content that violates a legal ownership interest of any other party.
C. The city reserves the right to restrict or remove any content that is deemed in violation of this social media policy or any applicable law.
D. The city will approach the use of social media tools as consistently as possible.
E. All new social media tools proposed for city use will be approved by the city manager.
F. Administration of City of Palmer Social Media Sites. 
    1. The information technology committee will maintain a list of all city of Palmer social media sites, including login and password information. Assigned department employees will inform the committee of any new social media sites or administrative changes to existing sites.
    2. The city must be able to immediately edit or remove content from social media sites.
G. For each social media tool approved for use by the city the following documentation will be developed and adopted:
    1. Operational and use guidelines;
    2. Standards and processes for managing accounts on social media sites;
    3. City and departmental branding standards;
    4. Enterprise-wide design standards;
    5. Standards for the administration of social media sites. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.70.020 Facebook standard policy.
A. Purpose. Facebook is a social networking site. Businesses and governments have joined individuals in using Facebook to promote activities, programs, projects and events. This standard is designed for city departments looking to drive traffic to the city’s website and to inform more people about city activities. These standards should be used in conjunction with the city’s social media use policy. As Facebook changes these standards may be updated as needed.
B. Establishing a Page. When a department determines it has a business need for a Facebook account, it will submit a request to the city manager via the information technology committee. Once approved, the information technology committee will create the boilerplate business page for the department. Applications are not to be added to a city Facebook site without approval by the committee. All city provided branding images must meet city branding standards.
C. Content. 
    1. Type of Pages. 
        a. The city will create “pages” in Facebook, not “groups.” Facebook pages offer distinct advantages including greater visibility, customization and measurability.
        b. For “type” description, choose “government.”
    2. Boilerplate. 
        a. The information technology committee will standardize and provide the Facebook page’s image, consisting of a picture and the city’s logo.
        b. Departments will include a mission introduction on the Wall page and send users first to the Wall to connect them to the freshest content. Boilerplate policy text regarding public disclosure and comments will be created using the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) static page application. A city boilerplate sentence should follow the department/program description:(Insert department) is a department of the city of Palmer, www.cityofpalmer.org. This site is intended to serve as a mechanism for communication between the public and [department] on the listed topics. Any comments submitted to this page and its list of fans are public records subject to disclosure pursuant to the Public Records Act and Palmer Municipal Code 2.90. Public records requests must be directed to the (insert department) public disclosure officer.
    3. If comments are turned on, the Wall page should include a link to a comment policy tab with the following disclaimer:Comments posted to this page will be monitored. The city reserves the right to remove inappropriate comments including those that have obscene language or sexual content, threaten or defame any person or organization, violate the legal ownership interest of another party, support or oppose political candidates or ballot propositions, promote illegal activity, promote commercial services or products or are not topically related to the particular posting.
    4. Link to the City. 
        a. A link to www.cityofpalmer.org will be included on the Info page.
        b. City department and project pages should be page “favorites” of other city Facebook pages.
    5. Page Naming. 
        a. Page name should be descriptive of the department.
        b. Departments will choose carefully with consideration for abbreviations, slang iterations, etc.
        c. The information technology committee will approve proposed names.
    6. Page Administrators. 
        a. A successful page requires “babysitting” by the designated department employee responsible for monitoring the Facebook page. Posts should be approved by the employee or a designated alternate.
        b. The designated employee is responsible for making sure content is not stale. Departments will designate a back-up administrator in the employee’s absence.
    7. Comments and Discussion Boards. 
        a. Comments to the Wall generally will be turned off but may be allowed on a case-by-case basis with request from the department and approval from the city manager.
        b. Discussion boards should be turned off.
    8. Style. 
        a. City Facebook pages will be based on a template that includes consistent city branding. The information technology committee will provide departments with the template.
        b. Departments will use proper grammar and standard AP style, avoiding jargon and abbreviations. Facebook is more casual than most other communication tools but still represents the city at all times.
    9. Applications. 
        a. There are thousands of Facebook applications. Common applications can allow users to stream video and music, post photos, and view and subscribe to Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds. While some may be useful to the page’s mission, they can cause clutter and security risks.
        b. An application should not be used unless it serves a business purpose, adds to the user experience, comes from a trusted source and is approved by the information technology committee.
        c. An application may be removed at any time if there is significant reason to think it is causing a security breach or spreading viruses.
D. Archive. 
    1. Each Facebook page will be set up in conjunction with an information technology committee designated city email account.
    2. Content that cannot be retrieved from Facebook via the Application Programming Interface (API) and needs to be retained as a record must be printed and maintained according to the city records retention policy. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.050     Procedures and rules for education and training.

4.90.005 Sexual harassment violates the law.
A. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age or national origin. Sexual harassment is included among the prohibitions.
B. According to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical acts of a sexual or sex-based nature when (1) submission to that conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or a condition of an individual’s employment; (2) an employment decision is based on an individual’s acceptance or rejection of that conduct; or (3) that conduct interferes with an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
C. It also is unlawful to retaliate or take reprisals in any way against an employee who has articulated a good faith concern about sexual harassment or discrimination against him or her or against another individual.
D. Examples of conduct that would be considered sexual harassment or constitute retaliation are presented in PMC 4.90.010. These examples are provided to illustrate the kind of conduct proscribed by this chapter. This list is not exhaustive.
E. Sexual harassment is unlawful, and the prohibited conduct exposes not only the city, but also the individuals involved in that conduct, to significant liability under the law. Accordingly, the city is committed to enforcing this policy regarding sexual harassment at all levels within the city. Employees should treat other employees with respect and dignity in a manner that does not offend the sensibilities of a coworker in a manner prohibited by law. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.010 Statement of prohibited conduct.
The city considers the following conduct to be illustrative of some of the conduct that violates the city’s sexual harassment code:
A. Physical assaults of a sexual nature, such as:
    1. An employee convicted of sexual assault, molestation, or an attempt to commit any such assaults will be discharged.
    2. Intentional physical conduct that is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, brushing against another employee’s body, or poking another employee’s body.
B. Unwanted sexual advances, propositions or other sexual comments, such as:
    1. Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes or comments about a person’s sexuality or sexual experience directed at or made in the presence of any employee who indicates or has indicated in any way that such conduct is unwelcome in his or her presence;
    2. Preferential treatment or promises of preferential treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual conduct, including soliciting or attempting to solicit any employee to engage in sexual activity for compensation or reward; and
    3. Subjecting, or threats of subjecting, an employee to unwelcome sexual attention or conduct or intentionally making performance of the employee’s job more difficult because of the employee’s sex.
C. Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the city’s workplace by city employees (except as may be done in the ordinary course of work), such as:
    1. Displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional materials, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning or pornographic, or bringing into the city’s work environment or possessing any such material to read, display or view at work. A picture will be presumed to be sexually suggestive if it depicts a person of either sex who is not fully clothed or in clothes that are not suited to or customarily accepted for the accomplishment of routine work in and around the workplace and who is posed for the obvious purpose of displaying or drawing attention to private portions of his or her body;
    2. Reading publicly or otherwise publicizing in the work environment materials that are in any way sexually revealing, sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning or pornographic; and
    3. Displaying signs or other materials purporting to segregate an employee by sex in any area of the workplace (other than restrooms and similar semiprivate lockers and changing rooms).
D. Retaliation for sexual harassment complaints, such as:
    1. Disciplining, changing work assignments of, providing inaccurate work information to, or refusing to cooperate or discuss work-related matters with any employee because that employee has complained about or resisted harassment, discrimination or retaliation; and
    2. Intentionally lying about, falsely denying, exerting pressure, or otherwise attempting to cover up conduct such as that described in any item above.
E. Other acts, such as:
    1. The illustrations stated above are not to be construed as an all-inclusive list of prohibited acts under this chapter;
    2. Sexual harassment is unlawful and hurts other employees. Moreover, each incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which all persons who share the victim’s sex suffer the consequences. An employee who engages in sexual harassment will be made to bear the full responsibility for that unlawful act. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.020 Schedule of penalties for misconduct.
The following schedule of penalties applies to all violations of this chapter. When progressive discipline is provided for, each instance of conduct violating the policy moves the offending employee through the steps of disciplinary action. In other words, it is not necessary for an employee to repeat the same precise conduct in order to move up the scale of discipline. A written record of each action taken pursuant to this chapter will be placed in the offending employee’s and alleged victim’s personnel files. The record will reflect the conduct or alleged conduct; the nature, scope and findings of the investigation; and the warning given or other discipline imposed.
A. Physical Assault of a Sexual Nature. 
    1. An employee convicted of sexual assault, molestation, or an attempt to commit any such assaults will be discharged.
    2. An employee’s intentional physical conduct that is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, brushing against another employee’s body or poking another employee’s body, will result in discipline at least as stringent as set forth in subsection (B) of this section, but may result in more stringent discipline up to and including dismissal for a first proven offense depending upon the severity of the misconduct.
B. Other Acts of Harassment by an Employee. An employee’s commission of acts of sexual harassment other than assault will result in nondisciplinary oral counseling on the alleged first offense; written warning, suspension or discharge on the first proven offense, depending on the nature or severity of the misconduct; and suspension or discharge on the second proven offense, depending on the nature or severity of the misconduct.
C. Retaliation. Alleged retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant will result in nondisciplinary oral counseling. Any form of proven retaliation will result in suspension or discharge on the first proven offense, depending on the nature and severity of the retaliatory acts, and discharge on the second proven offense.
D. Supervisors. A supervisor’s commission of acts of sexual harassment (other than assault) with respect to any other employee under that person’s supervision will result in non-disciplinary oral counseling on the alleged first offense; final warning or discharge for the first proven offense, depending on the nature and severity of the misconduct; and discharge for any subsequent offense. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.030 Procedures for making, investigating, and resolving sexual harassment and retaliation complaints.
A. Complaints. 
    1. An employee may make a sexual harassment complaint to the employee’s supervisor, department director or to the personnel officer. The purpose of having several persons to whom complaints may be made is to avoid a situation in which an employee is faced with complaining to the person, or a close associate of the person, who would be the subject of the complaint.
    2. Complaints of acts of sexual harassment or retaliation that are in violation of this sexual harassment chapter will be accepted in writing or orally, and anonymous complaints will be taken seriously and investigated. Anyone who has observed sexual harassment or retaliation should report it to the employee’s supervisor, department director or to the personnel officer. A complaint need not be limited to someone who was the target of harassment or retaliation.
    3. Only those who have an immediate need to know, including the investigative officer(s) and/or designee, the personnel officer, the city manager, the city attorney, the alleged target of harassment or retaliation, the alleged harassers or retaliators, and any witnesses, may find out the identity of the complainant. All parties contacted in the course of an investigation will be advised that all parties involved in a charge are entitled to respect, and that any retaliation or reprisal against an individual who is an alleged target of harassment or retaliation, who has made a complaint, or who has provided evidence in connection with a complaint is a separate actionable offense as provided in the schedule of penalties.
    4. Upon receipt of a complaint, a supervisor and a department director shall immediately notify the personnel officer; provided, however, if a complaint is against the personnel officer, a supervisor and a department director shall immediately notify the city attorney.
    5. The personnel officer shall investigate the complaint and may appoint investigative officers to assist with the investigation. If the personnel officer is the subject of the complaint, the city attorney shall investigate the complaint and may appoint investigative officers to assist with the investigation.
B. Investigations. 
    1. Each investigative officer will receive thorough training about sexual harassment and the procedures under this article and will have the responsibility for investigating complaints.
    2. When a complaint is made, the personnel officer will have the duty of immediately bringing the complaint to the confidential attention of the city manager.
    3. All complaints will be investigated expeditiously by the personnel officer (or city attorney) and that person will produce a written report which, together with the investigation file, will be shown to the complainant on request within a reasonable time. The investigative officer is empowered to recommend remedial measures based on the results of the investigation, and the personnel officer will promptly consider and act on that recommendation.
C. Cooperation. 
    1. An effective sexual harassment policy requires the support and example of city personnel in positions of authority.
    2. City agents or employees who engage in sexual harassment or retaliation or who fail to cooperate with city-sponsored investigations of sexual harassment or retaliation may be severely sanctioned by suspension or discharge.
    3. By the same token, officials who refuse to implement remedial measures, obstruct the remedial efforts of other city employees, and/or retaliate against sexual harassment complainants or witnesses may be immediately sanctioned by suspension or discharge. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.040 Imposition of remedial action.
For handling sexual harassment matters that involve employees (to include “volunteers”), the personnel officer shall have the powers of a department director and shall follow the procedures set out for a department director to impose adverse action as stated in PMC 4.50.050. The employee subject to a sexual harassment claim shall have the rights set forth in PMC 4.50.060 and 4.50.070. For handling sexual harassment matters that involve customers and third parties of the city, the personnel officer may make recommendations to the city manager, who shall then act to resolve the complaint. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

4.90.050 Procedures and rules for education and training.
A. Education and training for employees at each level of the workforce are critical to the success of the city’s sexual harassment policy. The following documents will help the city meet its goals in this area:
    1. A letter to all employees describing the city’s policy against sexual harassment from the city manager in addition to a copy of the city’s personnel manual which includes this article which constitutes the city’s policy on sexual harassment.
    2. The city manager’s letter will be conspicuously posted along with the Alaska Human Rights Commission’s poster on sexual harassment throughout the workplace and in each department: on each city bulletin board, in all central gathering areas, and in every locker room.
    3. The letter and poster must be clearly legible and displayed continuously.
    4. The city manager’s letter will indicate that copies of the city’s sexual harassment policy are available at no cost to an employee and how they can be obtained.
B. Education and training include the following components:
    1. As part of general orientation, each recently hired employee will be given a copy of the letter from the city manager and requested to read and sign a receipt for the city’s policy statement on sexual harassment included in the personnel regulations so that they are on notice of the standards of behavior expected.
    2. When the personnel regulations are significantly altered and distributed to the employees, each employee will be given a copy of the letter from the city manager and requested to read and sign a receipt for the city’s policy statement on sexual harassment included in the personnel regulation so that they are on notice of the standards of behavior expected.
C. All employees will participate on city time in annual seminars that teach strategies for resisting and preventing sexual harassment. At least one hour in length, these seminars will be conducted by one or more experienced sexual harassment educators.
D. All supervisory personnel will participate in an annual two-hour training session on sexual discrimination. At least one and one-half hours will be devoted to education about workplace sexual harassment, including training as to what types of remarks, behavior and pictures will be and will not be tolerated in the city’s workplace. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

    3. If the result of an initial test is an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test will be performed within 20 minutes. The results of an initial test and the confirmation test are printed on the breath alcohol test forms, signed by both the breath alcohol technician and the driver, and transmitted to the applicable DER in a confidential manner.
    4. A driver tested who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall not perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle, nor shall the driver perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, until the start of the driver’s next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test.

C. Failure to provide adequate breath for testing when required without a valid medical explanation, failure to remain available for post-accident testing, failure to provide adequate urine for testing without a valid medical explanation, engaging in conduct that obstructs the testing process, or failure to sign the alcohol testing form constitutes a refusal to submit to testing. (Ord. 12-001 § 3, 2013)

6.14.020 Determination.
A. In order for the chief to determine that an animal is dangerous or vicious, the chief shall determine that the animal meets the following criteria and shall classify the animal accordingly:
    1. Its actions are not excused under PMC 6.14.010(C);
    2. Dangerous, meaning the animal has, without provocation, approached, in a threatening or terrorizing manner, any person in an apparent attitude of attack, where the approach was not made upon the premises to which the owner had the legal right of possession;
    3. Vicious, meaning the animal:
        a. Has bitten, inflicted injury, assaulted or otherwise attacked or endangered the safety of a human being; or
        b. Has, without provocation, bitten, inflicted injury, assaulted or otherwise attacked or endangered the safety of a domestic animal; or
        c. Has been found dangerous or vicious on a prior occasion by the chief; or
        d. Is in violation of a previous order where the animal was classified as a dangerous or vicious animal.
B. If the chief classifies an animal as dangerous or vicious, the chief shall require that the animal be registered with the police department (unless the animal is to be destroyed and, in such case, documentation of the animal’s destruction shall be delivered to the police department) and determine whether to impose additional conditions if the animal is to remain in the city. The registration application shall contain the name and address of the owner, the breed, age, sex, color, and any other identifying marks of the animal, the location where the animal is to be kept, the registration fee established in the current, adopted budget and two color photographs, three inches by five inches, clearly showing the color and approximate size of the animal. Each animal registered shall be assigned an official registration number by the department. A certificate of registration shall be issued to the owner upon payment of the registration fee and proof of sufficient evidence that the owner has complied with all of the orders prescribed by the chief.
C. If the chief determines that additional conditions are required, the chief shall consider the following:
    1. The observed and reported past and present behavior of the animal;
    2. The circumstances of the incident and the extent of the injury to the attacked person or animal;
    3. The reasonably foreseeable harm that could occur if no conditions are imposed;
    4. The owner’s past history of compliance with this title, including compliance with redemption conditions which the chief has previously imposed on the owner; and
    5. The nature and location of any restraint or confinement system which the owner has in place at the time the chief makes his decision.
D. The chief may order the owner to comply with some or all of the following conditions:
    1. Confinement. The chief may order the owner of a dangerous or vicious animal to confine the animal, at all times, either indoors or, if outdoors, in a proper enclosure for a dangerous or vicious animal up to and including one consisting of a securely enclosed and locked pen or structure, suitable to prevent the entry of young children, or any part of their bodies or other foreign objects, and designed to prevent the animal from escaping. The pen or structure shall have secure sides, and prevent the animal from digging out through the bottom or escaping over the top. The pen or structure shall also provide the animal protection from the elements. All pens and enclosures must comply with all zoning and building regulations of the city. The owner shall also display in a conspicuous manner a sign using the words “Beware of Dog” on the pen or structure or near the entrances to the residence where the animal is kept. At any time when the animal is not confined as required, the animal shall be muzzled in a manner as to prevent it from escaping, biting or injuring any person, and kept on a leash no longer than four feet with the adult owner or some other responsible adult attending the animal.
    2. Liability Insurance. The chief may order the owner of a dangerous or vicious animal which has caused an injury to any person or severe injury to any animal to maintain, in full force and effect, a liability insurance policy issued by an insurance company authorized to sell insurance in Alaska or by an “eligible surplus line insurer,” as defined in AS 21.34.900(2), in the amount of at least $100,000 for coverage against any damage or injury that may be caused by the animal during the period for which licensing is sought. The insurance shall contain a provision requiring the city be named as an additional insured for the sole purpose of being notified by the insurance company of any cancellation, termination or expiration of the policy.
    3. Spaying or Neutering. The chief may order the owner of a dangerous or vicious animal to arrange for the alteration of the reproductive capacity, through spaying or neutering, of the animal. Alteration shall be at the owner’s expense.
    4. Obedience Class. The chief may order that the animal be enrolled in and complete obedience classes. The classes shall be at the owner’s expense.
    5. Humane Euthanasia. The chief may order the humane destruction of any animal that has been found to be vicious. Euthanasia shall be at the owner’s expense.
E. In the event the animal has already been impounded and if the owner consents to the conditions as set by the chief, the animal, unless destroyed, shall be released to the owner upon compliance with the conditions of release and payment of required fees. If the owner does not consent to the conditions, the chief may order the animal humanely destroyed no sooner than 96 hours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) after service upon the owner of the chief’s decision. Oral notice to the owner at the hearing shall constitute one means of service.
F. If the chief determines that the owner has trained or conditioned an animal to be vicious or allowed or permitted the training or conditioning, the chief may require that the owner comply with any or all of the subsections contained in subsection (D) of this section (other than subsection (D)(5) of this section) as a condition to owning another animal in the city. The requirements may not extend beyond three years, commencing with a determination and classification of the owner’s animal as vicious.

“Junk vehicle” means a motor vehicle, as that term is defined by AS 28.40.100(12), that is: (1) stripped, wrecked or otherwise inoperable due to mechanical failure, and (2) has not been repaired because of mechanical difficulties or because the cost of repairs required to make it operable exceeds the fair market value of the vehicle; provided, however, if such motor vehicle is currently registered for operation on the public roads of the city and is insured under the requirements of AS 28.22.011, then it is presumed not to be a “junk vehicle.” To meet the insurance requirement, proof of motor vehicle liability insurance or a certificate of self-insurance that complies with AS 28.20.400 must be submitted to the city manager.

B. Upon expiration of the 10-day, or 30-day period where relevant, the city manager may impound a junk vehicle and sell it at public auction pursuant to the notice provisions of PMC 8.37.040 or may have the vehicle privately sold, crushed or otherwise destroyed without further notice. If a vehicle is destroyed, the city manager will notify the Alaska Department of Public Safety. (Ord. 296 § 3, 1984)

8.37.040 Disposal of junk vehicles.
Upon satisfaction of the notice requirements of this chapter, a vehicle may be disposed of by public auction 20 days after notice of the auction is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. A notice shall describe the vehicle and specify the place, date and time at which it will be sold. A copy of the notice of auction will be sent to the state of Alaska, Department of Public Safety. (Ord. 296 § 3, 1984)

8.37.050 Recovery of costs.
The costs of impounding, storing, selling and destroying junk vehicles may be charged or assessed by the city against the vehicle, the registered owner of the vehicle, any person who has acquired legal title to the vehicle from or through the registered owner and any person who has violated PMC 8.37.020(A).

Hearings shall be informal and technical rules of evidence do not apply. A person who requests a hearing may retain an attorney if he desires. The city manager may appoint a hearing officer. Proceedings of the hearing shall be recorded. The city manager/hearing officer shall state on the record the reasons for the decision and indicate the evidence relied on. (Ord. 296 § 3, 1984)

8.37.070 Redemption.
A person who presents satisfactory proof of right to possession of the junk vehicle may redeem the vehicle removed under this chapter at any time before auction sale or destruction of the vehicle, by paying the charges of towing, storage, notice, other costs of impoundment and any applicable penalty imposed by law. (Ord. 296 § 3, 1984)

8.37.080 Other rights preserved.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting the right of any person to operate a lawful junk or storage yard. (Ord. 296 § 3, 1984)

8.37.090 Fines.
A violation of this chapter is an offense punishable by the fine established in the current, adopted budget. (Ord. 14-027 § 5, 2014)

C. “Emergency” means a situation where there exists a substantial likelihood of serious harm to either property or persons, and conditions are such that it is impossible or highly impractical to use a car to accomplish the purpose for which the O.H.V. is being used.
D. “Operate” means to drive or be in actual physical control of an O.H.V.
E. “Operator” means every person who operates an O.H.V.
F. “Owner” means a person, other than a lienholder, having the property interest in or the title to an O.H.V., and is entitled to the use or possession thereof.
G. “Register” means the act of assigning a registration number to an O.H.V. as required by the Alaska Department of Public Safety. (Ord. 464 § 4, 1993)

10.08.020 Operation requirements.
A. No person may drive, operate, stop or move an O.H.V. in the following ways or under the following circumstances which are declared to be unsafe and unlawful:
    1. Upon a public way (including sidewalk, bike path, alley, highway, street, roadway, shoulder or median) within the city except to cross a public way; provided, that such crossing is:
        a. At an angle of approximately 90 degrees to the direction of the public way about to be crossed and at a place where no obstruction prohibits a quick and safe crossing, and
        b. The O.H.V. is brought to a complete stop before crossing the shoulder or main traveled way, and the driver of the O.H.V. yields the right-of-way to all other traffic traveling on the public way about to be crossed; provided, this provision does not apply to operation of an O.H.V. on the New Glenn Highway where, incidentally, state law applies;
    2. On park land or the private property of another (to include, without limitation, the Alaska Railroad) without the express permission to do so by the owner or occupant of the property. Such permission shall be in writing and carried by the O.H.V. operator and displayed upon demand to a peace officer or other appropriate authority;
    3. In a careless, reckless or negligent manner so as to endanger the person or property of another, or to cause injury or damage to such person or property;
    4. While under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and drugs;
    5. To knowingly or intentionally chase, run over or kill any animal;
    6. Without having such O.H.V. registered if required in accordance with the requirements of AS 05.30.010 through 05.30.050 and 05.30.080, which are adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein. If the O.H.V. is a snow vehicle, in addition to displaying the numbered registration decals on each side of the cowling of the snow vehicle as required by AS 05.30.040(b), the registration certificate issued by the Alaska Department of Public Safety shall be affixed at all times to the main structural portion of the snow vehicle.

B. Violation of subsection (A)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section is a public nuisance. An O.H.V. found to constitute a public nuisance under this chapter may be impounded immediately by the police department unless a reasonable and expeditious alternative to impoundment is readily apparent and available.

12.03.010 Purpose.
A purpose of this chapter is to protect the public safety, health and welfare of city residents by providing a means to bring about the development of neighborhood parks, mainly to serve new residences. A purpose is to have the development that creates the new neighborhood park demand participate in paying some of the costs of the new neighborhood parks. It is not the purpose of this chapter to have new development cure existing deficiencies in neighborhood park service, although some incidental cure of existing deficiencies may occur. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.020 Parkland transfer upon residential land subdivision.
A. The owner or owners of each new residential subdivision in the city or of a new phase of a phased residential subdivision may voluntarily agree to convey land (to include, at the option of the owner, park improvements thereon) to the city for use as a neighborhood park in the subdivision.
B. The land (and improvements) are subject to the determination of the city manager that the land (and improvements) are suitable for neighborhood park purposes.
C. In addition, the value of transferred land (and improvements) is subject to the reasonable agreement of the city manager based upon the value of the land, improvement materials, and reasonable labor cost of installation and/or construction.
D. The city manager’s determinations or method for determination may be set out in the subdivision agreement.
E. The agreed-upon value of the land (and improvements) shall be a credit belonging to the owner of the subdivision that may be used, to include by assignment, to offset the neighborhood park development fees arising out of development in the subdivision, including other phases of the subdivision where applicable. The credit is not valid to offset the fees in areas other than the subdivision. If the amount of the credit is greater than the amount of the neighborhood park development fees arising out of development in the subdivision, including other phases of the subdivision, the owner or assignee(s) are not entitled to any rebate or refund of the excess credit. However, the owner may, with the written approval of the city manager, declare any amount of the agreed-upon value of the property conveyed to the city to be a gift to the city. The portion of the value declared to be a gift shall be deducted from the agreed-upon value of the property to determine the amount of the credit belonging to the owner.
F. Subject to council approval, the city may agree to buy a lot in a subdivision to be designated as a park. Subject to owner approval, the city may pay for the property in cash or partly in cash and partly in neighborhood park development fee credits.
G. For any property conveyed to the city under this section, upon conveyance of the property to the city, the city agrees to designate the land as neighborhood park land. The city may, but need not, improve the property. The city may leave the property in its natural state for use as a park. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.030 Neighborhood park development fee.
A. After July 1, 2003, all residential development (excluding mobile homes) in the city for which a building permit is required shall be subject to the payment of a neighborhood park development fee; provided, however, if before that date a building permit application has been received by the city, then no such fee shall be required for the permitted development. After July 1, 2003, all residential development by means of mobile homes for which approval by the building official is required under PMC 15.04.050(A) shall be subject to the payment of a neighborhood park development fee; provided, however, (1) if before that date a request for such approval has been received by the city, then no such fee shall be required for the approved development, (2) no such fee shall be required for mobile homes locating in any mobile home park validly existing in the city on July 1, 2003, and (3) no such fee shall be required for any mobile homes locating in a mobile home park that has paid the fee for each space in the mobile home park.
B. The fee shall be due and collected at the time of building permit application and the permit shall not be issued until the fee is collected. For a mobile home, the fee shall be due and collected at the time of the request for approval under PMC 15.04.050(A) and the approval shall not be granted until the fee is collected.
C. The amount of the fee may be set by resolution of the council from time to time, based upon a report showing the neighborhood park level of service (the number of acres of neighborhood parks per 1,000 residents of the city), a rough average cost per acre of residential land in the city (in lot sizes) together with the reasonable cost of developing and equipping a neighborhood park, the number of occupants per dwelling unit for single-family dwelling units and for multifamily dwelling units, all reduced by the amount of 15 percent for an equitable adjustment. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.040 New construction.
The neighborhood park development fee is applicable to the construction of new residential dwelling units. The fee is not applicable to mere additions to single-family or multifamily residences, except where the addition adds a separate dwelling unit or units in which case the fee is applicable.

(Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.050 Accounting procedures – Reports.
A. All fees collected under this chapter shall be deposited in the newly established neighborhood parks development projects fund. The finance director shall establish a separate designated reserve account for neighborhood parks and shall maintain records for the account. All interest earned by the fund shall be allocated to the account. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the acquisition of land and the development of neighborhood parks.
B. The finance director shall provide an annual report on or before May 1st of each year for the previous calendar year on the fee account showing the source and amount of the moneys collected, earned or received, and neighborhood park improvements that were financed in whole or in part by the fees. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.060 Expenditure of fees.
A. Neighborhood park development fees shall be expended for the acquisition of land and the development of neighborhood parks only. The fees shall be expended or encumbered for such uses within six years of collection, unless there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for fees to be held longer than six years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons must be identified in written findings by the city council.
B. Neighborhood park development fees shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in existing neighborhood parks.
C. The fees shall not be used for maintenance or operation.
D. Regarding the expenditure of the fees, the term “development of neighborhood parks” includes but is not limited to planning, land acquisition, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, costs of equipment and goods, and administrative expenses, and any other similar expenses and costs reasonably related to the development of a neighborhood park.
E. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of city improvements for which the fees may be expended or to reimburse the city for such improvements, the fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the development of neighborhood parks. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.070 Refunds.
A. The current owner of property on which the neighborhood park development fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fee if the city fails to expend or encumber the fees within six years of collection, or such greater time as may be established in written findings by the city council documenting extraordinary or compelling reasons for extension beyond six years. (The term “current owner” excludes but is not limited to the following: an assignee of credits or later owner of the property.) In determining whether fees have been encumbered, the fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of each claimant.
B. The request for a refund must be submitted to the city manager in writing within one year of the date the right to claim a refund arises or within one year of the date notice is given, whichever is later. Any fees that are not expended within these time limitations, and for which no application for refund has been made as herein provided, shall be retained and expended on the development of neighborhood parks. Refunds of the fees under this subsection shall include any interest earned on the fees. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.080 Neighborhood park development fee as additional and supplemental requirement.
The neighborhood park development fee is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land or the issuance of building permits. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

12.03.090 Appeals.
A. Within 10 days’ delivery of notice of the decision of the building official or city manager to the appellant, a person may challenge the imposition of a fee imposed pursuant to this chapter by filing with the city clerk a written notice of appeal with a full statement of the grounds and an appeal fee of $200.00 or such other amount as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the council. The city may continue processing the building permit application if the notice of appeal is accompanied with a bond or other security in an amount equal to the neighborhood park development fee.
B. The appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the amount of the fee was not calculated according to the procedures established in this chapter.
C. At a regular meeting following the filing of the appeal, the council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the city clerk shall mail notice of hearing to the appellant at the address given in the notice of appeal. The hearing shall be conducted by the council at the time and place stated in the notice, and the determination of the council shall be announced at the conclusion of the hearing or at the next regular meeting of the council. The determination of the council shall be final, subject to appeal to the superior court for the state of Alaska, at Palmer. (Ord. 603 § 4, 2003)

B. Each single-family residence which is outside the city and connected to the city utility system shall be charged a monthly service charge as established by the city manager and approved by the city council. The charge shall be the obligation of the owner of the premises served by the city utility. If the premises are occupied by a person not the owner, that person shall be jointly and severally liable for the monthly service charge with the owner. Said service charge shall become effective for the first full calendar month of service after service is commenced. Failure to pay the service charge when due gives the city the right to immediately discontinue utility services to any residence upon which such charge is unpaid. Discontinuance of service in no way affects the city’s right to enforce collection of past due charges.
C. The city manager is authorized and directed to establish monthly service charges for utility services to other types of structures outside the city which are hereafter connected to the city utility system. The charge established by the city manager shall be based on the single-family residence charge as modified to reflect greater or lesser utility use, as the case may be. The charge shall be the obligation of the owner of the structure so served. If the occupant is not the owner, the occupant shall be jointly and severally liable for the charge with the owner. The city may discontinue utility services to any structure when the service charge is due and unpaid.

Customers shall be responsible for all utility extensions. From time to time, as city equipment and personnel are available, upon request by the customer, the city may assist the customers in performing maintenance, charging such customer for such assistance. (Ord. 421 § 3, 1991; Ord. 122 § 9, 1965)

13.08.090 Service discontinuance.
The city may at any time without notice discontinue utility services for repairs and the like without liability for resultant loss or damage. Public notice of service interruptions will be given whenever possible, but the city shall not be bound to do so. (Ord. 122 § 10, 1965)

13.08.100 Service disconnection for cause.
The city reserves the right to disconnect the service and to remove its meters and other appliances whenever any utility bill is not paid when due, or to prevent fraud, or for any cause the city manager may deem sufficient; provided, the city may not disconnect utility service without first sending or otherwise providing the customer notice of intended termination along with information on procedures to contest the termination. (Ord. 525 § 9, 1997; Ord. 122 § 12, 1965)

13.08.110 City manager rule promulgation authority – Compliance required.

        a. The developer shall submit a traffic impact analysis prepared by an engineer licensed by the state of Alaska under AS Title 8. Operational analysis and determination of level of service (LOS) for the traffic impact analysis prepared under this section must be in accordance with the Transportation Research Board’s publication Special Report 209, Highway Capacity Manual (most current version).
        b. The minimum acceptable LOS at intersections and on road segments both on the development’s opening date and 10 years after the development opens are as follows. Subject to subsection (C)(5) of this section, these minimums are not met for noncity roads, then the city need not grant the LRE permit, except in its best interests.
            i. LOS C, if the LOS on the date of application is LOS C or better;
            ii. LOS D, if the LOS on the date of application is LOS D or poorer; or
            iii. If the LOS is poorer than LOS D, a lower minimum LOS is acceptable if the operation of the road does not deteriorate more than 10 percent in terms of delay time or other appropriate measures of effectiveness from the LOS before the development’s opening date.
        c. The traffic impact analysis must address the following:
            i. Intersections on roads where traffic to any approach is expected to increase as a result of the proposed development by at least five percent of the approach’s capacity.
            ii. Segments of roads between intersections where total traffic is expected to increase as a result of the proposed development by at least five percent of the segment’s capacity.
            iii. Each driveway or approach road that will allow egress from or ingress to a road for the proposed development.
            iv. Parking and circulation routes within the proposed development to the extent necessary to ensure that traffic does not back up onto a roadway.
            v. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities that are part of the road network affected by the development.
        d. For a development expected to generate less than 250 vehicle trips during the peak traffic hour of an adjacent road, the traffic impact analysis must consider the following:
            i. Projected traffic as the development’s anticipated opening date, excluding the traffic generated by the development; and
            ii. Projected traffic at the development’s anticipated opening date, including the traffic generated by the development.
        e. For a development expected to generate at least 250 vehicle trips during the peak traffic hour of an adjacent road, in addition to the projected traffic volumes before and after the completion of the proposed development, the traffic impact analysis must consider the:
            i. Projected traffic 10 years after the development opens, excluding traffic generated by the development; and
            ii. Projected traffic 10 years after the development opens including the traffic generated by the development.
        f. A traffic impact analysis prepared under this section must identify the following:
            i. Locations where road improvements are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts, including locations where the LOS is less than acceptable under this section (A) due to the development at either the opening date or 10 years after the development opens or (B) at either the opening date or 10 years after the development opens without the development and what improvements are necessary to prevent the LOS from deteriorating further.
            ii. Road improvement alternatives that will achieve an acceptable LOS or minimize degradation of service below an already unacceptable LOS (A) on the opening date of the development and (B) 10 years after the development opens for a development expected to generate 250 or more vehicle trips during the peak hour of the adjacent road on the opening date of the development.
            iii. Bicycle or pedestrian improvements necessary to accommodate bicycle and pedestrian traffic as negotiated between the city and the applicant; and
            iv. Improvements needed for internal circulation and parking plans.
        g. The city will review and comment upon a traffic impact analysis prepared and submitted under this section. The city will, in its discretion, request clarification or further analysis of the impacts that it considers necessary to adequately consider the risks presented to the traveling public by the proposed development. If alternative means are proposed by an applicant for mitigation of the traffic impacts of a proposed development, the city will select the alternative that provides the greatest public benefit, at the least private cost, and that meets the appropriate LOS on an impacted city road. If the city accepts a means of mitigation, the mitigation must be successfully completed before an occupancy certificate is granted.
C. Traffic Impact Mitigation. 
    1. Developments expected to generate 250 or more vehicle trips during the peak hour of the adjacent road on the opening date of the development shall make improvements as follows:
        a. Improvements to a road or intersection shall be made to maintain an acceptable LOS if a road or intersection has an acceptable LOS under subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section without traffic generated by the development and an unacceptable LOS under subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section with traffic generated by the development at the opening date of the development or 10 years after the development opens.
    2. If a road has an unacceptable LOS under subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section without traffic generated by the development, either at the opening date of the development or 10 years after the opening of the store, the developer shall make improvements to the adjacent roads so the operation of the roads does not deteriorate more than 10 percent in terms of delay time or other appropriate measures of effectiveness with the addition of the traffic generated by the development at the opening date of the development or 10 years later.
    3. A development for which a traffic impact analysis report has been approved shall use signs and markings on approaches to highways within the development that conform to the Alaska Traffic Manual. The city adopts by reference the Alaska Traffic Manual, consisting of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, 1988 Edition, including Revisions 1 through 7, issued by the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, and the State of Alaska Supplement, as revised as of January 27, 1992. Internal circulation and parking layout must provide sufficient queuing distance within the development between the road and potential internal block points to ensure no traffic backs up onto the highway, including bicycle or pedestrian facilities.
    4. If a traffic impact analysis discloses impacts upon pedestrian and bicycle traffic, a developer shall take steps to mitigate the impact.
    5. The city may, in its best interest, relax the requirements for mitigation under this section, if it finds in writing that the:
        a. Roads only marginally achieve an acceptable LOS without the traffic generated by the development and would likely fall below an acceptable LOS within five years; or
        b. Traffic generated by the development results in an unacceptable LOS and the cost of mitigating the impacts is disproportionate to the cost of the development.
D. Landscaping and Screening. The landscape plan shall provide for landscaping that reasonably reduces visual, sound, and/or traffic distraction impacts of vehicular movements. The variety of materials selected shall be compatible with the climate, planting location, and landscaping function.
    1. Landscaping shall be equal to 15 percent of the total lot area.
    2. Landscaping shall consist of a combination of components such as lawn area, landscape beds, ground cover plants, shrubs, evergreen trees, deciduous trees, earthen berms and wooden fences. No single landscaping component may occupy more than 50 percent of the area to be landscaped.
        a. Evergreen and deciduous trees shall be planted at intervals no greater than 15 feet on center and shall be a minimum of five feet in height at planting.
    3. All parking lots visible from public rights-of-way shall be screened with a combination of trees, shrubs or other plant materials, possibly in combination with fences and berms.
    4. Where a side, or portion thereof, of an LRE parcel is adjacent to a residential zone, an earthen berm, no less than six feet in height, with evergreen trees a minimum of five feet in height at planting at intervals of 15 feet on center shall be provided on such side or portion thereof. A solid wooden fence, no less than six feet in height, may be substituted for the berm. Due to the high winds in Palmer, an interlap fence (alternating board on each side) may also be used, and may be preferable to solid. For purposes of this subsection, “adjacent” means touching or across from an alley or residential street. “Adjacent” does not mean across from a commercial, collector, or arterial street.
    5. All landscaping structural requirements (e.g., drainage, grading, concrete, rock or keystone bed structures, sidewalks) must be met at occupancy. Topsoil addition and final grading and seeding and all plantings of flora must be met within 12 months of occupancy, or within the first growing season after occupancy, whichever comes first. The owner, lessee, etc., shall continue to meet such requirements thereafter and replace all dead shrubs and trees to maintain the landscaping in good condition.
    6. Grassy areas shall be maintained according to standard turf practices, which include regular mowing, fertilizing and watering.
E. Setbacks. The minimum setback for any building shall be 35 feet from the nearest property line.
F. Parking. 
    1. A detailed parking plan shall address the convenience and safety of patrons, adequate winter lighting, landscaping amenities, and the configuration of parking spaces, walkways, and other amenities. Aesthetic features, landscaping, and the design of parking areas shall, wherever practicable, reduce the appearance of large expanses of parking from neighboring streets and enhance the view of the establishment from its principal point(s) of access.
    2. No more than 60 percent of the off-street parking area for the lot, tract or area of land devoted to the large retail establishment shall be located between the front facade of the large retail establishment and the abutting streets (the front parking area).
    3. The minimum number of parking spaces is determined by PMC 17.64.010. Additional landscaping and community space may be required where the applicant wishes to provide parking that exceeds 115 percent of the minimum standards of this title.
    4. The owner and lessees shall prohibit storage or overnight camping of trailers or recreational vehicles.
G. Pedestrian Access. The establishment shall provide sufficient accessibility, safety, and convenience to pedestrians. Unobstructed sidewalks shall link the site to existing public sidewalks, its entrances, and abutting residential and commercial areas. Sidewalks shall also be provided along the full length of any building where it adjoins a parking lot. Sufficient sidewalks or barriers shall be provided between parked cars and buildings to prevent vehicles from protruding into reasonable pedestrian passages. Sidewalks shall be separated from adjacent streets by an area sufficient for snow storage and to provide a buffer for pedestrians from vehicular traffic.
H. Outdoor Lighting. A photometric and outdoor lighting plan to mitigate negative impacts on adjacent uses shall be submitted for approval. Outdoor lighting fixtures shall be arranged and shielded so that area lighting shall not shine unreasonably into the sky or onto adjacent property. This reasonableness standard may consider the zoning and uses of the adjacent parcels.
    1. The outdoor lighting plan shall contain the following information:
        a. Plans to indicate the location, type, intensity, and height of luminaries including both building and ground-mounted fixtures.
        b. A description of the luminaries, including lamps, poles or other supports and shielding devices, which may be provided as catalogue illustrations from the manufacturer.

I. Outdoor Storage or Display Areas. Products stored or displayed outside shall not be visible from abutting property. Areas for the outdoor storage and sale of seasonal inventory shall be permanently defined and screened with walls and/or fences. The height of stored materials shall not exceed the height of the screening wall or fence. Materials, colors, and the design of screening walls and/or fences and their covers shall be complementary to those used as predominant materials and colors on the building.
J. Trash Collection and Recycling. Trash handling and recycling shall be screened from public streets and pedestrian ways, internal pedestrian sidewalks, and residentially used or residentially zoned property by landscaping or architectural features in conformity with the external design and materials used by the establishment. Screening shall be designed to abate noise and to confine loose trash. The routes and hours of trash collection may be limited as necessary to reduce the effects of noise or traffic on surrounding residential areas.
K. Snow Storage or Removal. A plan for snow storage or removal from the site shall be submitted and approved. Use of sidewalks, circulation drives, and landscaped areas for snow storage shall be prohibited.
L. Community Spaces. In large retail establishments over 70,000 square feet, appropriate interior and exterior public areas shall be provided and maintained for customers and visitors to the site to congregate and relax. Public areas shall be no less than three percent of the square footage of the structure.
M. Delivery and Loading Spaces. Delivery and loading operations shall be designed and located to mitigate visual and noise impacts on adjacent R-zoned property. Routes and hours may be limited as necessary to reduce the effects of noise or traffic on surrounding residential areas. Commercial trailers, shipping containers, and similar equipment used for transporting merchandise shall remain on the premises only as long as required for loading and unloading operations, and shall not be maintained on the premises for storage purposes.
N. Aesthetic Characteristics. 
    1. Facades and Exterior Walls, Including Side and Back Walls. The building shall be designed in order to reduce the appearance of massive scale or a uniform and impersonal appearance and to provide visual interest. Long building walls shall be broken up with projections or recessions.
    2. Detail Features. The design shall provide architectural features that contribute to visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive scale effect by breaking up the building wall, front, side, or rear, with color, texture change, and repeating wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs.
    3. Roofs. The roof design shall provide variations in roof lines and heights to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain or monotonous style.
    4. Materials and Colors. The buildings shall have exterior building materials and colors which are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the overall development plan. Construction material shall provide color, texture and scale. Predominant exterior building materials shall not include smooth-faced concrete block or prefabricated steel panel.
    5. Entryways shall be designed to orient customers and add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by providing inviting customer entrances that are protected from the weather. Each entrance shall be a clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than three of the following: canopies or porticos; overhangs; recesses/projections; arcades; raised corniced parapets over the door; peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor patios; display windows; architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design; integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.
        a. Structures over 80,000 square feet shall have a minimum of two entryways.
    6. Screening of Mechanical Equipment. Roof- or ground-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof-mounted, the screen shall be designed to conform architecturally with the design of the building, whether it is with varying roof planes or with parapet walls. Ground-mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened. The screen shall be of such material and be of sufficient height to block the view and noise of the equipment.
O. The development plan for a large retail establishment shall include, and govern the improvement of, the entire commercial parcel.
P. Northern Design Elements. Provision of design elements may be required that address Palmer’s distinct geography, low light angles, length of days, cold temperatures, wind, snow and ice.

A. Application. A developer must apply to the city for a large retail establishment (LRE) permit. The application shall include a site plan and all components of the development plan. The fee established in the current, adopted budget shall accompany the application.
B. Public Meeting. The city manager or designee will review the plans with the applicant to assure compliance with the standards set in this section, and the applicant may make necessary amendments to the site plan and development plan. A public meeting shall be held where the applicant shall display all plans and public comments shall be received on the development plans. The meeting shall be advertised in the newspaper of general circulation in which the city regularly advertises its council meetings. The public notice shall run at least once a week for two weeks, with the first publication at least 10 days before the date of the meeting.
C. Response to Public Comments. After the public meeting, the applicant and the city manager shall duly consider the public comments and the applicant may make amendments to the site plan and development plan.
D. City Manager Review. When the city manager determines the application and plans meet the requirements of PMC 17.32.025, the manager will give tentative approval, subject to such special limitations as the manager may deem reasonable arising out of the comprehensive plan, mitigation of adverse impacts of the project on the neighborhood or public facilities, or the public health and safety.
E. Objections to Special Limitations. If the applicant objects to any of the manager’s proposed special limitations, the applicant may request review of the special limitations by the city council. The applicant shall clearly denote each objection and state why the applicant objects to it. The applicant’s objections shall be forwarded to the city council with the manager’s proposed special limitations.
F. Public Hearing. The council shall hold a public hearing regarding the large retail establishment permit only if the applicant objects to the manager’s special limitations. The council shall not hold a public hearing on the LRE permit if the applicant does not object to the manager’s special limitations or if the manager proposes no special limitations. The hearing shall cover the manager’s tentative approval, the manager’s proposed special limitations, and the applicant’s objections. Notice for the public hearing shall be given in accordance with PMC 17.80.030, as if the LRE were a zoning map amendment.
G. Final Determination. If there is no public hearing, then the decision of the manager, to include the manager’s proposed special limitations, is final. If there is a public hearing, then after the public hearing the council shall determine whether the permit shall be approved. After due consideration of the public input, the council may approve the permit if the applicant’s plans meet the requirements of PMC 17.32.025, subject to such special limitations as the council deems are reasonably related to the comprehensive plan, mitigation of adverse impacts of the project on the neighborhood or public facilities, or the public health and safety.
H. Effective Permit. The permit shall not be effective until signed by the city manager and also signed by the applicant agreeing to comply with the plans approved by the council and such special limitations as set by the council. A copy of the plans and limitations shall be attached to the permit. The permit shall contain a provision that any violation of the terms, conditions, or limitations of the permit will subject the permittee and the large retail establishment to all remedies at law or in equity, to include without limitation, injunctive relief and a civil penalty for each violation of up to $300.00 after due notice and an opportunity to cure the violation.

B. The city recognizes that some or all of the land annexed into the city has not been previously subject to zoning districts and that there is a need to provide a reasonable transition toward land use regulation by the city. Over time, property in the T – transitional district should develop a pattern of land uses more appropriate to one of the more traditional zoning districts found in Chapters 17.20 to 17.58 PMC. (Ord. 13-009 § 3, 2014; Ord. 632 § 4, 2004)

A. Any expansion or change of legal use for all conditional uses for which the Matanuska-Susitna Borough granted a conditional use permit under Chapter 17.60 or 17.61 MSBC;
B. Any expansion or change of legal use for all uses for which the Matanuska-Susitna Borough granted a permit under Chapter 17.48 MSBC (mobile home park), Chapter 17.70 MSBC (use involving alcohol beverage sales and dispensing), or Chapter 17.90 MSBC (adult business);
C. Cemeteries;
D. Storage of more than 10,000 gallons of petroleum products;
E. Chemical plant;
F. Manufacture or storage of explosives, gunpowder, or fireworks; and

B. Uses that constitute a nuisance as set out by Chapter 8.36 or 8.37 PMC; provided, however, this subsection does not apply to agricultural facilities or operations to the extent protected by AS 9.45.235;
C. Noxious, injurious or hazardous uses, which are defined as any use that may be noxious, injurious, or hazardous to surrounding property or persons by reason of the production or emission of dust, smoke, refuse matter, odor, gas fumes, noise, vibration, or similar substances or conditions; provided, however, this subsection does not apply to agricultural facilities or operations to the extent protected by AS 9.45.235.

D. For all uses in the transitional district, the area of land in use upon the effective date of annexation may not be increased by more than 50 percent without approval under Chapter 17.80 PMC. For example, if five acres of a 40-acre parcel is in use upon annexation, the amount in use may not be increased by more than 50 percent without approval under Chapter 17.80 PMC.
E. The limitations set out in this section are in addition to and not in lieu of limitations set out elsewhere in this title or at law. (Ord. 13-009 § 10, 2014; Ord. 632 § 4, 2004)

    1. Buffer landscaping shall consist of shrubs, trees, or a combination which will attain a mature height of at least six feet, with an average height of eight feet, planted at intervals less than 10 feet on center. The landscaping bed shall be eight feet in width. Deciduous trees or bushes may no make up more than 50 percent of the mixture.
    2. All landscaping requirements must be met within 12 months of occupancy, and continue to meet such standards thereafter. All dead shrubs and trees shall be replaced to maintain the landscaping. (Ord. 632 § 4, 2004)

The zoning administrator may impose such conditions on the requested amnesty as the zoning administrator determines are appropriate to protect the general welfare.
        c. A determination under this subsection shall describe the type and dimensions of the encroachment, and shall include a copy of the as-built survey that was submitted with the application for registration.
D. In accordance with PMC 17.68.050, no such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
E. In accordance with PMC 17.68.050, should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 60 percent of its assessed value at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 15-021 § 3, 2015)

17.60.080 Future street width lines.
A. For the purpose of measuring yard dimensions and determining building locations with respect to future street widths as provided in this title, minimum future width lines are established for certain streets and highways based upon the street and highway plan of the comprehensive plan. After January 17, 1978, no building or structure, or portion thereof, shall hereafter be erected, nor shall any portion of a building extending into any front or street side yard be altered, nor shall any use of land be conducted, except the use of land for open use not requiring a building or structure, so that the same will be closer to the right-of-way line of any street than any future width line.

+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
B. Calculation of Amounts of Required Parking. 
    1. Unless a specific use is listed above, the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of the combination of uses on the lot.
    2. If the calculation of required spaces results in a fraction of a parking space, the number shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. (Ord. 06-017 § 3, 2006; Ord. 05-036 § 10, 2005)

17.64.035 Off-site parking.
A. All parking spaces provided shall be on the subject lot with the main building they serve, except that the commission, by conditional use, may permit the parking spaces to be on an abutting lot or any lot within 300 feet of the building if it determines that it is impracticable to provide parking on the subject lot.
    1. Effective March 27, 2001, if the commission permits parking spaces to be on a lot other than the subject lot, then the commission, as a matter of law, shall require at a minimum the following conditions: that the off-site lot be made subject to duly recorded enforceable covenants running with the land reasonably acceptable to the city, which covenants:
        a. Burden the off-site lot to the extent necessary to provide adequate incremental parking for the benefit of the subject lot;
        b. Make the city a third-party beneficiary of the covenants;
        c. Prohibit the termination, amendment, or subordination of the covenants without council approval; and
        d. Have a priority position prior to any deed of trust, mortgage or other encumbrance that can foreclose out the covenants.
    2. The required priority position of the covenants may be obtained by due subordination of any existing encumbrance.
    3. Upon the recording of the covenants, the owner of the subject lot must reimburse the city for obtaining a title policy on the off-site lot showing the covenants have the required priority position.
    4. The owner of the subject lot shall post and maintain signs on the subject lot and on the off-site lot informing the public of the off-site parking relationship between the off-site lot and the subject lot.
    5. If through change of use of the subject lot or otherwise the off-site parking is no longer required or if the extent of such requirement is significantly reduced, then the city, upon the written request duly signed by both the owner of the subject lot and the owner of the off-site lot and delivered to the city manager, shall in due course and after council action allow the termination or amendment of the covenants to meet the then-current requirements for parking for the subject property. (Ord. 06-017 § 3, 2006; Ord. 05-036 § 11, 2005)

17.64.041 Shared use parking.
Joint use of off-street parking facilities within 600 feet may be permitted by the commission subject to the following conditions:
A. The off-street parking requirements for buildings of limited uses, for example churches, auditoriums, clubs, or lodges, may be supplied through the use of off-street parking facilities provided for other uses, for example, business offices, retail stores, and manufacturing or wholesale buildings whose operations are not normally conducted during the same hours.
B. Off-street parking space designated for joint use shall meet all other requirements as set out in this chapter.
C. Sufficient evidence shall be presented to the commission to demonstrate that there will be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the use or structures for which the joint use is proposed.
D. The owner of the parcel seeking a shared parking agreement has adequate area on the lot or within 300 feet of the lot which could be used for parking in the event it is no longer possible to obtain shared parking.
E. The use of off-street parking space for joint use shall be subject to the prior approval of the commission. (Ord. 06-017 § 3, 2006; Ord. 05-036 § 13, 2005)

17.64.050 Central business district.
In order to encourage economic growth in the downtown core and permit the redevelopment of property to its highest commercial use, parking requirements may be waived after review by the city council. It is the intent of this clause to provide as much off-street parking as practical while allowing commercial development in the core area. The central business district is described as follows:Beginning at the intersection of the Palmer/Wasilla Highway and the Glenn Highway centerlines, then north along the centerline of the Glenn Highway to the centerline of W. Auklet Avenue, then east along the centerline of W. Auklet to the east side of parcel 18N02E33 Tract 1-A, then south along the east side of said parcel until the centerline of the alleyway, then east along the centerline of the alleyway to the centerline of N. Bonanza Street, then south along centerline of N. Bonanza Street to the centerline of E. Arctic Avenue, then east along the centerline of E. Arctic Avenue to the centerline of S. Denali Street, then south along the centerline of S. Denali Street to the centerline of E. Cottonwood, then east to the centerline of S. Gulkana Street, then south along the centerline of S. Gulkana to the southeast corner of Tract A, Arbor Estates, then west along the south property line of Tract A to Lot 4, Block 2, Arbor Estates, then south to the southeast corner of Lot 4, Block 2, Arbor Estates, then west along the south property lines of Lots 4, 3, 2, and 1, Block 2, Arbor Estates to the centerline of S. Eklutna Street, then north along the centerline of S. Eklutna Street to the centerline of E. Fireweed Avenue, then west along the centerline of E. Fireweed to the centerline of S. Colony Way, then south along the centerline of S. Colony Way to the junction of S. Colony Way and the Glenn Highway centerlines, then north along the centerline of the Glenn Highway to the point of beginning.
A. The following minimum number of parking spaces shall be provided for all structures and uses in the central business district only. For uses not specifically identified in this section, the requirement for parking shall be the same as for the use duly determined by the zoning administrator to be the most similar.

    2. No parking spaces have been lost due to redevelopment or change of use;
    3. There is a city-owned, fee-in-lieu designated public parking area (excluding the parking lots at City Hall and the fire station located on W. Evergreen Avenue and S. Cobb Street) within 600 feet of the building as measured along public rights-of-way;

17.64.055 Fee-in-lieu parking program.
For property located in the central business district, an in-lieu parking fee shall be submitted to the city for each required free off-street parking space that is not provided and for which a waiver has been granted. The in-lieu parking fee shall be determined annually based on the costs for planning, acquisition, design, development, construction, financing (including interest on city self-financing), maintenance and operation of off-street parking facilities within 600 feet of the subject building as measured along public rights-of-way.

    2. Any landscaping between the building and the parking lot counted towards the percentage requirement must have a minimum five-foot-wide area exclusive of any vehicle overhang. Only low-level shrubs, ground cover, and grass shall be used in vehicle overhang areas.
E. No parking lot shall contain 45 or more contiguous parking spaces without a curbed planting area. Interior landscaping planters shall be dispersed throughout the entire parking lot area. Parking lots in the industrial and business park zoning districts may be exempt from interior landscaping requirements. Applications may be submitted to the commission requesting substitution of interior landscaping in exchange for common use area(s) for employees, such as a picnic or exercise area.

*Prior ordinance history: Ord. 454.

17.68.010 Intent.
A. Within the districts established by this title and amendments that may later be adopted, there exist incompatible lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such land, structure or use, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title or future amendments.
B. It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to unreasonably encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.020 Extension and enlargement.
A. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such land, structure or use. Among other things, the attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises or the addition of other uses constitutes such an extension or enlargement.
B. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun before the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such building and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. “Actual construction” is defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. In addition, where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun in preparation of rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction; provided, that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. In no event shall the time of such construction exceed a period of one year except for a demonstrated cause approved in writing by the commission. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.030 Nonconforming lots of record.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this title, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record as of January 17, 1978, or as of the date of annexation for land annexed to the city after that date. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. (Ord. 05-016 § 3, 2005; Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.040 Nonconforming uses of land.
Where, as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such use, a lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this title as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such use, unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located;
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such use;
C. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such land is located;
D. No additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of this title shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.050 Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure existed as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such structure which structure could not be built under the terms of this title or its amendments by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, setback, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
B. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 60 percent of its assessed value at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title;
C. Subsection (B) of this section notwithstanding, if a residential dwelling, or residential dwelling units, in a residential district is damaged by any involuntary change, including fire, flood or earthquake, so that the cost of renewal of the damaged parts exceeds 60 percent of the assessed value of the entire building, then such building may be replaced or reconstructed to the same footprint on the original location, subject to the following:
    1. The owner duly applies for a building permit to replace or reconstruct the building within one year of the involuntary change,
    2. No part of the structure may encroach into public rights-of-way or adjacent property,
    3. The intended use of the building is the same as, or less intensive than, the prior use and is a permissible use in the district,
    4. A professional engineer, duly licensed as such by the state of Alaska, certifies to the city that the foundation of the building is structurally reusable as is and the building official does not object to the certification; or a professional engineer, duly licensed as such by the state of Alaska, certifies to the city that the foundation of the building is structurally reusable subject to economic repairs and the engineer provides plans and specifications for the reconstruction, and the building official does not object to the certification, the plans and specifications or the subsequent reconstruction,
    5. Projections beyond the footprint including architectural features, roof eaves, foundation footings, porches, decks, terraces, patios, unenclosed stairways and fire escapes, and attached structures, may also be replaced or reconstructed as they existed on the original building, so long as they do not encroach into public rights-of-way or adjacent property,
    6. The owner provides the building official with an as-built survey by a land surveyor, duly licensed as such by the state of Alaska, of the footprint and location of the original building and projections beyond the footprint,
    7. The building may be replaced or reconstructed under this subsection with no fewer than the number of off-street parking spaces as were provided for the original building; provided, that if it is feasible to eliminate any noncompliance with the off-street parking requirements, such noncompliance must be eliminated to the extent feasible, and
    8. The building as reconstructed will not pose any significant risk to health or safety as may be determined by the building official and the fire chief.
Nothing in this subsection constitutes an approval or waiver of an encroachment of the building or its footprint or projections beyond the footprint into a public right-of-way or adjacent property. Nothing in this subsection waives any other applicable laws or regulations including without limitation this title or the building code.
D. Subsection (B) of this section notwithstanding, if a building or structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Matanuska Colony Community Center as either a historic structure or a contributing structure is damaged by any involuntary change, including fire, flood or earthquake, such building may be replaced or reconstructed to the same footprint on the original location, provided:
    1. The owner duly applies for a building permit to replace or reconstruct the building with a design that matches the damaged design, construction materials, color, and texture so as to retain the historic character of the property; and
    2. The building as reconstructed will not pose any significant risk to health or safety as may be determined by the building official and the fire chief. (Ord. 10-023 § 3, 2010; Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.060 Nonconforming uses of structures and premises in combination.
If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of structure and premises in combination, existed as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such use or structure that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such buildings;
C. Any structure, or structure and premises in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
D. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, except when government action impedes access to the premises, the structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
E. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land unless the land itself is in a nonconforming use. “Destruction,” for the purpose of this subsection, means damage to an extent of more than 60 percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of destruction. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.065 Large retail establishments.
A. A large retail establishment existing on or before May 11, 2004, shall be deemed to be a permitted large retail establishment and not a nonconforming use or structure; provided, that the structure was not otherwise a nonconforming structure. The provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the expansion, reconstruction, renovation, or remodeling of a large retail establishment existing on the effective date may be allowed only after a limited development plan approval is granted by the city manager. This section shall not, however, apply to the interior remodeling, renovation, or repair to interior portions of large retail establishments existing on the above effective date. In approving limited development plans under this subsection, the city manager shall apply the standards set out in PMC 17.32.025 in a manner proportionate to the extent of the expansion, reconstruction, renovation, or remodeling proposed. The cost of compliance with the standards set forth in PMC 17.32.025 shall not exceed 10 percent of the cost of the expansion, reconstruction, renovation, or remodeling. In determining the degree to which the standards set out in PMC 17.32.025 shall apply to the expansion, reconstruction, renovation, or remodeling proposed, the city manager shall also consider:
    1. Whether strict application of any standard of PMC 17.32.025 would result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties or work an undue hardship on the owner of the property;
    2. Whether the proposed design and development plan satisfies the intent of this section as well or better than would strict compliance with standards set forth in PMC 17.32.025;
    3. Whether relaxation of any requirement of PMC 17.32.025 would impose any significantly greater negative impact on surrounding property; and
    4. Whether the proposed design and development plan brings the site into greater compliance with the standards set forth in PMC 17.32.025 than the existing structure.
B. Applications for limited development plan approval under this subsection shall be processed in the same manner as applications for a development plan approval required for new establishments. (Ord. 606 § 8, 2004)

17.68.070 Nonconforming parking, loading or other characteristics of use.
If the characteristics of a use, such as off-street parking, off-street loading or other matters required by this title in relation to specified uses of land, structures or premises, are not in accord with the requirements of this title, no change shall be made in such characteristics of use which increase nonconformity with such requirements. Change will be permitted in the direction of conformity to the requirements of this title. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.080 Repairs and maintenance.
A. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 20 percent of the current assessed value of the building; provided, that the cubic volume of the building as of the date the provisions of this title or its amendments became applicable to such land, structure or use shall not be increased.
B. Buildings or structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Matanuska Colony Community Center as either a historic structure or a contributing structure are exempt from the limitations of subsection (A) of this section if the proposed repairs or replacement support the use of the building or structure without affecting the defining historic characteristics of the building and its site. (Ord. 10-023 § 5, 2010; Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

17.68.090 Curative application.
A. The city recognizes that between January 17, 1978, and January 27, 2004 (the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter), the city annexed areas into the city and the city also increased zoning restrictions on some parcels inside the city. As such, this title or certain increased restrictions therein may have become applicable to those structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use after January 17, 1978, but this chapter may not have been expressly available for them. Technically, these structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use may not have been considered legal under this title. The purpose of this section is to cure such oversight and to apply nonconforming use status to those above-described structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use; provided, that the status otherwise applies to them.
B. This chapter shall apply to those structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use described in subsection (A) of this section so that they are considered nonconforming; provided, that they were lawful at the time this title or the increased restrictions first applied to them; and provided further, that they have otherwise continued to meet the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 609 § 5, 2004)

C. That granting the conditional use permit will not be harmful to the public health, safety, convenience and comfort;
D. That sufficient setbacks, lot area, buffers, or other safeguards are being provided to meet the conditions;
E. If the permit is for a public use or structure, the commission must find that the proposed use or structure is located in a manner which will maximize public benefits. (Ord. 454 § 4, 1992)

17.72.060 Conditions and requirements.
In recommending the granting of a conditional use, the commission shall stipulate in writing requirements which it finds necessary to carry out the intent of this title. These stipulations may increase the required lot or yard size, control the location and number of vehicular access points to the property, require screening and landscaping where necessary to reduce noise and glare, and maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area, or impose other conditions and safeguards designed to ensure the compatibility of the conditional use with other uses in the district. (Ord. 454 § 4, 1992)

17.72.070 Commission action.
A. The commission shall render a decision on the application for conditional use permit within 45 calendar days from the date of public hearing.

17.84.010 Intent.
The intent of the planned unit development (PUD) zoning district is to:
A. Effect a zoning change to the existing (underlying) zone through the process outlined in Chapter 17.80 PMC as follows:
    1. The proposed change is in accordance with the borough and city comprehensive plan;
    2. The proposed change is compatible with surrounding zoning districts and the established land use pattern;
    3. Public facilities such as schools, utilities and streets are adequate to support the proposed change;
    4. Changed conditions affecting the subject parcel or the surrounding neighborhood support the proposed change; and
    5. The proposed change is consistent with the public welfare and does not grant a special privilege to the owners; and
B. Permit flexibility in design, placement of buildings, and use of open spaces, including modification in requirements for lot frontage, building setbacks, and design of circulation facilities to best use site potentials afforded by special features of geography, topography, size or shape; and
C. Encourage creative approaches in land development that will result in a more efficient, desirable environment in harmony with that of the surrounding area, including but not limited to providing a higher population density and increased intensity of use than is permitted in the zone in which the project is located. However, the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in planned unit development shall not be less than the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in the R-4 high density residential district as listed in PMC 17.27.060(C). Appropriate mixing of uses and alternative approaches to development are permitted through the PUD zoning district process; and
D. To further this intent, the terms and conditions of a PUD district supplement the regulations in the underlying zoning district, and modify and supersede any conflicting regulations in the underlying zoning district.
E. A PUD zoning classification that contains commercial uses, where one or more buildings are principally designed for use for the retail sale of merchandise, and where the total building(s) footprint exceeds 20,000 square feet, may only be approved in conjunction with an approved overall site plan in accordance with the criteria for a large retail establishment permit. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.020 Permitted locations.
A. Planned unit development projects may be approved only in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-1E, CL and CG zones.
B. The site must abut, and the major internal street serving the planned unit development project must be directly connected to, a public road which has been improved, established, and is maintained by the city, borough or state.
C. In the R-1 district, commercial uses must front on a major arterial, arterial or commercial street. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.030 Site area.
The required minimum area for a PUD is 60,000 square feet. The minimum area may be waived when planned unit development is used to facilitate redevelopment in the central business district as depicted on the most recently adopted zoning district map. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.040 Permitted uses.
In a residential, nonresidential or mixed land use PUD, various land uses may be permitted, subject to limitations or conditions, if such uses are deemed by the council to be appropriate and further the goals of the city comprehensive plan. The following uses may be permitted in a PUD:
A. One-family, two-family, and multifamily residences;
B. Commercial uses as may be specifically and selectively authorized;
C. Recreational facilities including, but not limited to, tennis courts and playgrounds;
D. Schools, libraries, public buildings and community halls;
E. Shopping malls;
F. Any permitted or conditional use in the underlying zone. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.050 Application process.
The application process for a PUD involves a four-step process including: (1) a preapplication conference, (2) preliminary review by the planning and zoning commission with written recommendation forwarded to the city council, (3) council action, and (4) action on final plan. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.060 Preapplication conference.

17.84.070 Commission preliminary review.
A. Upon receipt of a complete application for a PUD, the zoning administrator shall schedule a public hearing date before the commission following the established meeting schedule. Notice of the public hearing shall be in accordance with PMC 17.80.030.
B. Before the commission may act on the PUD application, the commission shall review the preliminary plan to determine if it is consistent with the intent and purposes of this chapter; whether the proposed development advances the general welfare of the community and neighborhood; and whether the benefits, combination of various land uses, and the interrelationship with the land uses in the surrounding area justify the deviation from standard district regulations.
C. Within 30 days following the conclusion of the public hearing, and upon making the required findings for a zone change and in conformance with subsection (B) of this section, the commission shall make a written report to the council for approval or modification of the proposed PUD zone change, and shall recommend that the council approve a change from preliminary site plan to interim site plan as submitted or as modified.
D. If unable to make the required finding to support approval, the commission shall deny both the rezoning and the preliminary site plan and no further action shall be taken thereon unless the initiating party or property owner within 20 days of the commission decision files a written statement with the city clerk requesting the PUD be considered by city council. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.080 Council action.
The following council action shall be required for a PUD zoning district:
A. Upon receipt of a written recommendation for adoption of a PUD zoning district and approval of the preliminary plan by the commission, or by appeal of the petitioner, the city clerk shall cause an ordinance to be prepared setting forth the details of the proposed zoning map amendment. The ordinance shall be introduced at the next council meeting in the normal course and a date for the public hearing established. The city clerk shall give notice of the public hearing in accordance with the procedures of PMC 17.80.030. Notice of the public hearing given to the property owners described in PMC 17.80.030(A)(2) shall include a description of the protest rights established by PMC 17.80.081.
B. After due consideration of the recommendation by the commission, written comments received from the public, testimony at the public hearing, the information provided, and the effect the proposed change would have on the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience, the council may decide to approve PUD rezoning and grant interim approval of the PUD site plan, deny the PUD rezoning, or may decide to amend the PUD district as follows:
    1. As submitted by the initiating party; or
    2. With special limitations, more restrictive than submitted; provided, that a PUD initiated under this chapter may be so modified only with the written consent of the initiating party.
C. For a PUD zoning district, the decision of the council shall be final. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.120 Major adjustments.
In the event the final plan contains substantial changes from the approved interim PUD site plan as described in PMC 17.84.110(A)(1) through (4), the zoning administrator shall forward the final PUD plan to council for its review and final approval. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.84.130 Status of PUD approval.
A. Final approval of a PUD application confers on the applicant and any subsequent owners of the PUD property the right to utilize the property included as part of the approved PUD in accordance with the overall density, dwelling unit mix and final plan of the approved PUD. However, for the total PUD or for each portion of the PUD, if staging of development is planned, a site plan review by the zoning administrator is required for each phase, prior to the issuance of building permits, and for any portion of the PUD having a council approved interim PUD plan.
B. Signed Agreement. If the application and site plan are approved by the council, the applicant and all owner(s) of record or the legal representative of the owner(s) of record of all property included within the planned development shall then sign an agreement that the approved application and site plan, and the conditions of approval, shall be binding upon the applicant and owner(s) of record and upon their heirs, successors, and assigns. The city shall require a bond or surety to guarantee construction of road, water, and sewer improvements. Such agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the council. The application and site plan shall not be officially approved nor may the building permit be issued, until said agreement has been signed as required herein and has been received by the city clerk.
C. Revocation or Changes. The council may revoke a PUD or any portion thereof in instances where substantial construction activity has not been ongoing anywhere within the PUD within a three-year period after the final approval. Revocation of any portion of a PUD reverts that portion of the PUD to the status and requirements of the original zoned district, without benefit of the PUD provisions. Proposed changes in a PUD, other than those considered a part of site plan review for all or a portion of the PUD, must be processed in the same manner as the original PUD procedure. The council shall give notice of intention to revoke such approval at least 30 days prior to review by the council. (Ord. 17-007 § 4, 2017)

17.86.010 Intent.
This chapter sets out the criteria under which accessory dwelling units (ADUs) may be incorporated into certain zoning districts. Accessory dwelling units promote a diverse range of quality housing, allow for more efficient and flexible use of existing housing stock and infrastructure, and respond to changing family needs and smaller households by allowing a mix of housing. The development standards set forth in this chapter help maintain high quality residential neighborhoods and protect neighborhood stability, property values, and single-family residential appearance of the neighborhood by ensuring that ADUs are developed under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.020 Application and approval.
A. An application for an ADU permit shall be initiated by the owner on a form prescribed by the zoning administrator. For the purposes of this chapter, the “owner” shall mean any person named on the deed, a contract purchaser, or the beneficiary of a trust named on the deed.
B. The permit shall be accompanied by the notarized affidavit affirming that at least one owner will occupy the principal dwelling or the accessory unit, and that the ADU will conform to the requirements of the permit and the requirements of this chapter.
C. A nonrefundable fee of $50.00 shall accompany the application.
D. The zoning administrator shall review the application for code compliance within 30 calendar days.
E. The zoning administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of approval or denial. Approved applications shall be issued an ADU permit. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.030 General provisions.
The following provisions apply to accessory dwelling units:
A. One ADU is permitted per residentially or agriculturally zoned lot larger than 10,000 square feet.
B. One ADU may be added to or created within a detached single-family dwelling on a lot, tract, or parcel, if the detached single-family dwelling is the sole principal dwelling on the lot, tract, or parcel.
C. The owner must occupy either the principal or accessory dwelling unit a minimum of six months each calendar year.
D. The owner may not receive any rent from the owner-occupied unit.
E. Detached ADUs not part of a garage may be developed only on lots of 20,000 square feet or larger.
F. An ADU may be developed in either an existing or a new dwelling unit.
G. An ADU shall not be permitted on any lot with a bed and breakfast or child care center. Other home occupations shall be allowed, subject to existing regulation, in either the ADU or the principal dwelling unit, but not both.
H. For purposes of securing financing, a potential owner may request and receive a letter of pre-approval from the city indicating property is eligible for an ADU permit if the potential owner completes the application process and construction in accordance with this section.
I. An ADU shall not be sold separately unless legally subdivided. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.040 Development standards.
Development standards ensure that accessory dwelling units maintain and are compatible with the single-family appearance and character of the principal residence, lot, and neighborhood. All ADUs must conform to the following standards:
A. Codes. The ADU shall conform to all applicable codes, laws, and regulations.
B. Design. Attached ADUs shall maintain the style and exterior finishes consistent with the existing structure. Detached ADUs shall have exterior finishes that are consistent with local industry standards for residential exterior cladding. All exterior work shall be completed within eight months of start of construction.
    1. Accessory dwelling units contained within the principal dwelling unit shall be connected to each other by an interior door.
    2. There may be only one entrance located on each front or street side of the residence.
C. Height. The maximum height of a detached ADU shall be 25 feet.
D. Lot Area. The combined square footage of the principal and accessory dwelling units may not exceed the lot area coverage in the underlying zoning district.
E. Orientation. On lots of 40,000 square feet or less, detached ADUs shall be located at least 10 feet behind the front plain of the principal dwelling unit. On lots of 20,000 square feet or over, should the placement of the ADU in the rear of the lot negatively impact a neighbor’s view shed, a waiver from this requirement may be requested from the planning and zoning commission. Testimony from the impacted neighbors is encouraged.
F. Parking. One parking space shall be provided on site for each studio and one-bedroom ADU. Two parking spaces shall be provided on site for each two-bedroom ADU. Parking for the accessory unit is in addition to the required parking for the principal dwelling.
G. Setbacks. ADUs are subject to the setback and coverage requirements of the underlying zone.
H. Size. The ADU shall not be more than 40 percent of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling unit. An ADU may not be less than 300 square feet or more than 900 square feet. A maximum of two bedrooms is permitted. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.060 Lot covenant.
As a condition of the building permit for an ADU the property owner shall file with the State of Alaska Recorder’s Office a covenant pertaining to the property stating that the title company shall notify the city of Palmer within 30 calendar days of change of ownership. The above declaration is binding upon any successor in ownership of the property; lack of compliance shall be cause for revocation of the permit. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.080 Transfer of property.
An ADU permit is not transferable to any other property or person. When a property with an ADU is sold or otherwise transferred, the new owner must apply for an ADU permit as set forth in PMC 17.86.020 within 60 days from the date of transfer. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.090 Prior illegal uses.
A. All structures which meet the definition of accessory dwelling unit which are not recognized as legal nonconforming structures or uses of structures under Chapter 17.68 PMC shall comply with this subsection. Such structures may continue in existence, provided the following requirements are met:
    1. A permit application for an ADU is submitted to the zoning administrator within six months after the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes law.
    2. The unit complies with the requirements of this section.
B. If the unit does not comply with the requirements of this section at the time the permit application is filed, the zoning administrator may grant six months to bring the unit into conformance.
C. All owners of illegal units shall also be required to either legalize the unit or remove it.
D. This subsection does not apply to existing legal nonconforming uses of structures established pursuant to PMC 17.68.050. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.100 Right to appeal.
The commission’s decision on a waiver for the placement of any accessory dwelling unit in PMC 17.86.040(E) may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 17.98 PMC. Right of appeal is forfeited unless a written appeal is delivered to the clerk within 20 days of the commission’s decision. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

17.86.110 Annual review.
The zoning administrator shall report annually to the planning and zoning commission the number of ADU units established, the geographic distribution of the units, the average size of the units, the number and type of complaints, and completed enforcement actions. The commission shall reassess this chapter if records show that 20 percent of the single-family structures within the city have ADUs. (Ord. 07-026 § 4, 2007)

E. A decision by the hearing officer to remand the case on one or more issues, in accordance with PMC 17.98.090(A), is not a final decision with respect to any issue involved in the appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all matters decided by the hearing officer (except those remanded pursuant to PMC 17.98.090) will be deemed a final decision following the lower administrative body’s decision, provided no appeal is perfected within the time period specified in PMC 17.72.080.

    1. There is insufficient evidence in the record on an issue material to the decision of the case; or
    2. There has been a substantial procedural error which requires further public hearing.
A decision remanding a case shall describe any issue on which further evidence should be taken, and shall set forth any further directions the hearing officer deems appropriate for the guidance of the commission.
B. The commission shall act on the case upon remand in accordance with the decision of the hearing officer in the minimum time allowed by the circumstances. Cases on remand following a decision of the hearing officer shall take precedence over all other matters on the commission’s agenda. (Ord. 07-018 § 5, 2007)
