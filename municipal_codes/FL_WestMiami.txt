PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of West Miami, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the 1982 Code, as updated. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the 1982 Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as updated. 
    The various sections within each chapter of this Code have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this republication. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the republication, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this republication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Yolanda Aguilar, City Manager, and Ms. Annery Gonzalez, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a republication of this Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- This Part contains the Charter of the City of West Miami, as approved by the electorate at a referendum held coincident with the regular city election of April 9, 1980, and filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court on April 11, 1980. Note that by its terms (§ 8.08), it became effective April 14, 1980. 
The Charter is set out herein as originally adopted. Subsequent amendments will be worked into their proper places and amended or repealed provisions deleted, with the source of each such amendment being cited in parentheses following the provision amended. The absence of such a citation will indicate that the provision has not been amended and is as originally adopted. 
The editors have inserted words and phrases in brackets where necessary in the interest of clarity. Bracketed material should not be considered a part of the official Charter.

ARTICLE I. - CREATION AND POWERS 

§ 1.01 - - Creation and powers. 
    The City of West Miami, Florida, is hereby created which shall have all governmental, corporate and proprietary powers to enable it to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions and render municipal services, and may exercise any power for municipal purposes except as otherwise provided by law. 
Editor's note- Section 14 of Art. I, Laws of Fla. 1949, Ch. 26301, which was the former charter of the city, provided as follows:

    The City shall have the right to acquire by purchase, gift, devise, condemnation or otherwise, property, real or personal, or any estate or interest therein within or without the City and to improve, sell, lease, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of the same or any part thereof. 
    To the extent that this section purports to confer extraterritorial powers on the city, it is the opinion of the editor that it remains effective as a special act of the legislature. See Fla. Const., Art. VIII, § 2(c). 
State Law reference- General home rule powers of municipalities, F.S. § 166.021.

(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  Responsiveness. Prior to this Commission or any committee thereof hearing any protests relating to a competitive bid, request for proposal or request for qualifications, the City Manager shall request the City Attorney to certify whether the bid or proposal in question is responsive. Upon receiving such request, the City Attorney shall, in consultation with the City Manager if necessary, determine whether the bid or proposal is responsive. This Commission and any committee thereof shall be bound by the determination of the City Attorney with regard to the issue of responsiveness. 
(2)  A written intent to protest shall be filed with the City Clerk and mailed to all participants in the competitive process and to the City Attorney within three (3) working days of the filing of the Manager's recommendation. For purposes of calculating this period, the day of filing of the City Manager's recommendation with the Clerk shall not be counted. Such written intent to protest shall state the particular grounds on which it is based and shall be accompanied by a filing fee. The protester shall then file all pertinent documents and supporting evidence with the City Clerk and mail copies to all participants in the competitive process and to the City Attorney within three (3) working days after the filing of a written intent to protest. No bid protest shall be accepted unless it complies with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that a public records request is made within the first three (3) days of the above-referenced period, a protester may utilize any public records obtained as evidence or additional grounds for protest, provided that: 
a.  The protester met all the deadlines set forth above; and 
b.  A supplementary filing is made with the City Clerk within 48 hours of receipt of the records responsive to the request. 
(3)  Protests filed in accordance herewith shall be referred to a Hearing Examiner. A Hearing Examiner shall be appointed not later than five (5) working days following the filing of a bid protest. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct a hearing in connection with the bid protest which shall be completed within ten (10) working days following his or her appointment. The Hearing Examiner shall, within five (5) working days of the hearing, file written findings and recommendations with the City Clerk and shall submit or mail a copy of same to all participants in the competitive process and to the City Attorney. The Hearing Examiner may extend the deadline for completion of the hearing upon written petition for good cause shown, but such extension shall not exceed an additional five working (5) days. The Hearing Examiner shall consider the written protest and supporting documents and evidence appended thereto, the City Manager's recommendation, and supporting documentation, and all evidence presented at the hearing. The Hearing Examiner may also require written summaries, proffers, affidavits and other documents the Hearing Examiner determines to be necessary in order to conclude the hearing and issue the report and recommendation within the time limits set forth in this section. The Hearing Examiner shall be entitled to rely on evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of Florida. 
(4)  The Hearing Examiner shall allow a maximum of two (2) hours for the protester's presentation of its protest and a maximum of two (2) hours for the City's response to each protest. In the event of multiple protests, the Hearing Examiner shall allocate the time as necessary to ensure that the hearing shall not exceed one (1) day. 
(5)  The City Manager shall prepare a resolution, to be approved by this Commission, amending and setting forth a fee schedule for filing of bid protests. The fee shall be in the amount necessary to defray the cost of the bid protest process established in this section. The resolution also establish the amount of compensation to be paid the Hearing Examiner, and shall provide for a prorated reduction of that compensation in the event the Hearing Examiner fails to abide by the time limitations set forth in this section. 
(6)  Hearing Examiners shall be selected from a panel of retired judges who have served ten (10) or more years as Circuit Judges in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. Hearing Examiners may be selected from alternate sources where the City Attorney recommends in writing that such action is necessary to achieve greater diversity. 
(7)  The Hearing Examiner's findings and recommendation shall be presented to the Commission together with the recommendation of the City Manager. Notice thereof shall be mailed to all participants in the competitive process at least five (5) days in advance of such presentation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any prior resolution, the matter shall be heard by the Commission without prior presentation to any committee. The matter shall be resolved on the basis of the record before the Hearing Examiner and no evidence or issue which was not presented or raised at such hearing shall be considered. Presentations to the Commission by any participant in the competitive process or their representatives if authorized by subsection (b)(8) of this section shall be limited to ten (10) minutes per side. The foregoing time limitation shall be inclusive of all speakers addressing the Commission on behalf of each side. 
(8)  If the Hearing Examiner concurs in the City Manager's recommendation, a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the Commission members present shall be required to take other than the recommended action; provided, however, a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote shall not be required to reject all bids. If the Hearing Examiner concurs in the City Manager's recommendation, the Commission shall not allow presentations by any participants in the competitive process or their representatives at the time the matter is presented to the Commission. If the Hearing Examiner does not concur in the City Manager's recommendation, the participants in the competitive process and their representatives may make presentations to the Commission and the Commission shall decide the matter by majority vote. 
(9)  The City Manager may provide different time periods for the taking of any actions required hereunder when the interest of the City so requires by including appropriate language in the specifications or addenda thereto. 
(10)  The foregoing notwithstanding, the Commission, by two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the members present, may waive the requirements of this section and entertain a bid protest, upon written recommendation of the City Manager.

After three (3) months from the filing of such lien which remains unpaid, the Code Enforcement Board may authorize the City Attorney to foreclose on the lien.

(d)  A repeat violation which remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction in the civil violation notice shall be treated as a continuing violation, and the additional penalty for each day of continued violation shall be equal to the doubled amount due for the first day of the repeat violation. 
(e)  Continuing violation penalties shall accrue from the date of correction given in the civil violation notice until the correction is made or until a request for administrative hearing is filed, whichever comes first. If the named violator requests an administrative hearing and loses his appeal, the Code Enforcement Board shall determine a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be made, based on the considerations set forth in section 2-157. If correction is not made within the period set by the Code Enforcement Board, continuing violation penalties shall begin to accrue again after the time for correction has run.

(g)  Each case before the Code Enforcement Board shall be presented by the Inspector or representative of the department issuing the violation. 
(h)  The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the formal rules of evidence and those relating to witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if the Code Enforcement Board finds it competent and reliable, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. 
(i)  Each party shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called him to testify; and to rebut the evidence against him. 
(j)  The Code Enforcement Board shall make findings of fact based on the evidence in the record alone. In order to make a finding upholding a code enforcement officer's determination that a violation exists, the Code Enforcement Board must find that a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the violator was legally responsible for the violation of the relevant section of the ordinances or codes as cited, and that a violation does/did in fact exist. 
(k)  The prescribed time for correction of the violation given to the named violator and contained in the civil infraction notice shall be presumed to have been a reasonable time for correction. Upon presentation of relevant evidence by the named violator that the time for correction was not reasonable, the Code Enforcement Board may make a re-determination as to the reasonableness of the time for correction contained in the civil infraction notice is excessive. 
If the Code Enforcement Board determines that the time given for correction was insufficient, the penalty for a continuing violation may be calculated from the date determined by the Code Enforcement Board to be the reasonable date for correction. 
(l)  If the named violator is found guilty of the violation, he/she may be held liable for the costs of the administrative hearing. 
(m)  The fact-finding determination of the Code Enforcement Board shall be limited to whether the alleged violation did in fact occur and, if so, whether the person named in the civil violation notice is legally responsible for that violation. The Code Enforcement Board shall either affirm or reverse the determination of the code enforcement officer as to the responsibility of the named violator for the correction of the ordinance or code violation. The Code Enforcement Board may also modify the determination of the code enforcement officer as to the time for correction contained in the civil infraction notice, subject to the provisions of section 2-160. If the Code Enforcement Board reverses the determination of the code enforcement officer and finds the named violator not responsible for the alleged violation in the civil infraction notice, the named violator shall not be liable for the payment of any civil penalty, absent successful appeal of the Hearing Officer's ruling by the City. If the decision of the Code Enforcement Board is to affirm the code enforcement officer's determination of violation, then the following elements may be included: 
(1)  Amount of civil penalty; 
(2)  Administrative costs of hearing; and 
(3)  Date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent resumption of continuing violation penalties. 
(n)  The Code Enforcement Board shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt procedures for the conduct of hearings; 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses for hearings; subpoenas may be served by the City of West Miami Police Department or by the staff of the Code Enforcement Board; 
(3)  Subpoena evidence; 
(4)  Take testimony under oath; and 
(5)  Assess and order the payment of civil penalties as provided herein. 
(o)  The Code Enforcement Board shall not conduct a hearing if the named violator, prior to the scheduled hearing date, files with a duly authorized City and County board of appropriate jurisdiction for administrative interpretation of the legal provisions on which the alleged violation was based. Upon exhaustion of the administrative review and finalization of the administrative order by such board or body, the Code Enforcement Board may exercise all powers granted to them by this article. The Code Enforcement Board shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over alleged code violations where a named violator has properly filed a request for administrative interpretation and review by such City or County board or body until such time for review has lapsed. 
(p)  The Code Enforcement Board shall be bound by the interpretations and decisions of the duly authorized City and County boards of appropriate jurisdiction concerning the provisions within their respective jurisdictions. In the event such a board or body finds that the cited violation of the ordinance or code has not been properly interpreted, that provision upon which the violation is based, shall prohibit the Code Enforcement Board from proceeding with the enforcement of the alleged violation. 
(Ord. No. 95-02, § 1, 4-19-1995) 
Sec. 2-161. - Recovery of unpaid civil penalties; unpaid penalty to constitute lien; foreclosure. 
(a)  The City may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties. 
(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be recorded in the public records of Dade County and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or existed; if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator; and it may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this State, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the City of West Miami may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. 
(Ord. No. 95-02, § 1, 4-19-1995) 
Sec. 2-162. - Appeals. 
(a)  The violator or the City may appeal an order of the Code Enforcement Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Dade County Court. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the order by the Code Enforcement Board. A violator shall have the right to a de novo appeal provided that all other administrative remedies have been exhausted. 
(b)  In the absence of reversal of the Code Enforcement Board is ruling by an appellate court of competent jurisdiction, the findings of the Code Enforcement Board shall be conclusive as to a determination of responsibility for the ordinance or code violation, and such findings shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect unpaid penalties. 
(c)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the City from enforcing its City ordinance or City Code by any other means. The enforcement procedures outlined herein are cumulative to all others and shall not be deemed to be prerequisites to filing suit for enforcement of any section of this Code.

    Alarm system means any mechanical or electrical device, sold or installed, which is designed or used for the detection of an unauthorized entry into a building, structure, facility or enclosed area, or for alerting others of the Commission of an unlawful act within a building, structure, facility or enclosed area, or both; and which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated. "Alarm systems" include, but are not limited to: Telephone alarm devices, audible alarms and proprietary alarms. Excluded from the definition of "alarm systems" are devices which are not designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible, or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure, facility or enclosed area, or auxiliary devices installed by telephone companies to protect telephone systems from damage or disruption of service. 
    Alarm user means any person on whose premises an alarm system is maintained, within the City, except for alarm systems on motor vehicles or proprietary systems. If, however, an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises (other than a proprietary system) the person using such system is an alarm user. Uses of a "proprietary system" herein defined and excluded from the coverage of this article, are persons who use alarm systems to alert or signal persons within the premises in which the alarm system is located, or an attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup attempt.

    Law enforcement officer means the police chief or any officer employed by, and serving under the direction of, the police chief. 
    Notice, unless other specified, means written notice, given either by first class mail or personal service upon the addressee.

New development shares in this burden by paying a proportionate share of the reasonably anticipated average costs of public facilities needed to accommodate the demand for additional facilities created by new development as well as by complying with other appropriate development regulations and approval conditions. This section shall not be construed to authorize imposition of impact fees for public facility needs attributable to existing development.

The aforementioned provisions authorize and require the City to provide and finance public facilities; to provide for the health, safety and general welfare of the City; to coordinate the provision of adequate public facilities with land development; and to implement its Comprehensive Plan. Furthermore, the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. § 163.3202(3), encourages the use of innovative land development regulations, including impact fees.

(d)  Applicability. 
(1)  This section shall be uniformly applicable to all new development, and the appropriate impact fee, and applicable service charge, shall be collected prior to building plan approval, except where building plan approval is issued for additions, remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure or reconstruction of a damaged or destroyed structure, whether voluntary or involuntary, which result in no net increase in the number of residential dwelling units for residential structures or no net increase greater than one thousand (1,000) gross square feet for a nonresidential structure. The applicant has the burden of submitting documentation to the City proving the type and amount of previously existing development or use for determination by the City of the net increase for calculation of impact fees due. No refund of impact fees previously paid shall be provided for any decrease in the amount or type of development except as provided under subsection (j)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Where this section becomes applicable due to: 
a.  Additions, remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure; 
b.  Reconstruction of a damaged or destroyed structure, whether voluntary or involuntary; 
c.  A change in the use of a structure or land that increases the demand for public facilities; 
d.  An increase in the number of residential dwelling units for a residential structure; or 
e.  An increase in the gross square footage of a nonresidential structure; 
the amount of the impact fees shall be based solely upon the net increase in the demand for public facilities based on a comparison of the impact fees calculated for the prior development/use to the impact fees calculated for the proposed development/use. The applicant has the burden of submitting satisfactory documentation to the City proving the type and amount of previously existing use/development for use by the City in determining the net increase for calculation of impact fees due. 
(3)  Notwithstanding subsections (2) or (3) above, this section shall not be applicable to building plan approvals issued by the City prior to 8:00 a.m. on September 19, 2007, when the applicant proceeds to issuance of certificate of occupancy without invalidation, suspension or abandonment of the corresponding building plan approval. 
(e)  Establishment of impact fee districts. In furtherance of the implementation of this section, the Commission hereby establishes the following benefit districts for the identified impact fees: 
(1)  Police Impact Fee Benefit District, which boundary is identical with the boundary of the City, as may be adjusted from time to time; 
(2)  General Government Impact Fee Benefit District, which boundary is identical with the boundary of the City, as may be adjusted from time to time; and 
(3)  Park Impact Fee Benefit District, which boundary is identical with the boundary of the City, as may be adjusted from time to time. 
(f)  Imposition of impact fees. No building plan approval shall be issued for new development in the City unless the applicant therefor has paid the applicable impact fees imposed by this section, and applicable service charge if established by resolution of the Commission. Any building plan approval issued for new development without payment by the applicant and collection by the City of the applicable impact fees and service charge if applicable, shall be null and void. 
(g)  Calculation of impact fee and impact fee schedules. 
(1)  The City shall calculate the impact fees due under this section by: 
a.  Verifying the number and type of demand units which are proposed to be constructed as shown on the building plans by land use type, using dwelling units for residential uses, gross square footage of floor area for nonresidential uses, and specified demand units for certain types of nonresidential uses; and 
b.  Multiplying the number of demand units for each land use type represented by the proposed development by each applicable impact fee pursuant to subsection (g)(2) of this section. The total impact fees due shall be the sum of the amounts calculated for each applicable impact fee in subsection (g)(2) of this section. 
c.  If the land use applicable to a development is not listed in the fee schedules in subsection (g)(2) of this section, the fees for the most appropriate land use in the fee schedules, based on the characteristics of the proposed development as determined by the City Manager, shall be imposed. If the applicant believes that none of the land uses in the fee schedules are appropriate, the applicant shall be responsible for timely filing a petition under subsection (j) of this section. The land use characteristics and descriptions in the ITE Trip Generation Manual shall be used to determine the most appropriate land use. When multiple types of development are included in a building, the impact fees due shall be calculated for each type of development and included in the total impact fees due. When multiple buildings are included on building plans, the impact fees shall be calculated individually for each building and included in the total impact fees due. 
d.  Where a final petition determination has been made by the City Manager or a final decision issued by the Commission after a timely appeal, the impact fees due shall be calculated based on the petition determination or Commission decision.

(h)  Administration of impact fees. 
(1)  Collection of impact fee and service charge. Impact fees calculated and imposed pursuant to this section shall be collected by the collecting agency prior to issuance of building plan approval. If adopted by resolution of the Commission, the service charge shall be collected by the collecting agency at the same time as collection of the impact fees. 
(2)  Accounting and reporting of impact fee collections and expenditures. Impact fees shall be transferred from the collecting agency to the City Finance Department which shall be responsible for placement of such funds into the appropriate separate accounts by type of impact fee and applicable benefit district. The service charge, if adopted by resolution of the Commission, shall be placed in a separate account identified for management of the impact fee system and disbursed as set forth in this section. The City Finance Department shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each such account which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all moneys received, including revenue by building plan approval, and which shall document and ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively in accordance with provisions of this section. For purposes of petitions for refunds under subsection (j)(3) of this section, the expenditure and appropriation of impact fees shall be deemed to occur in the same sequential order as the collection of impact fees; in other words, the first fee in shall be the first fee out. 
(3)  Trust funds established. 
a.  There is hereby established a separate impact fee trust fund account for each of the following impact fees: police, general government and parks. If existing impact fee accounts comply with the requirements of this section, then such accounts may be deemed to be the impact fee trust fund accounts established herein. 
b.  Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h)(4) of this section. The disbursal of such funds shall be in accordance with the capital improvement program of the City. 
c.  Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts. Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds of such account. The funds of these accounts shall not be commingled with other funds or revenues of the City. 
(4)  Use of funds collected. Impact fees collected pursuant to this section shall be expended only for the type of system improvements for which the impact fee was imposed and only within the impact fee benefit district where the impact fee was collected. Impact fees shall be expended only on system improvements needed to accommodate the demand generated by new development. Impact fees shall not be expended to eliminate any deficiencies in facilities, land or equipment related to existing development or that may result from adoption of an increased level of service. The funds collected by reason of this section shall be used exclusively for the purpose of undertaking system improvements or for financing directly, or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness, the costs of system improvements. 
(5)  Annual review and modification. Beginning with adoption of the fiscal year 2009-2010 budget, the City shall annually, no later than 120 days after the annual capital budget and capital improvements program adoption process, review the impact fee ordinance procedures, assumptions, formulas, benefit district designations, and fee calculations, and issue an annual report. The annual report shall be distributed to the Commission by the City Manager. The annual report should, at a minimum, include information by individual benefit district and facility type on account balances, annual collections, annual expenditures, and system improvement projects funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The annual report should present any recommendations related to the impact fee system, including but not limited to, the need for any updates to the impact fee calculations, district boundaries, and ordinance. In reviewing the impact fee system, the City may consider: development occurring in the prior year, construction of proposed public facilities, changing facility needs, inflation and other economic factors, revised cost estimates for public facilities, land and/or improvements, changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to impact-fee-related capital improvements, and any other factors as may be relevant. The data in the annual report may be organized based on the City's fiscal year or calendar year. The annual report shall review the amount of service charges collected and the costs associated with the creation, administration, management and updating of the impact fee system and shall provide recommendations on any changes to the amount of the service charge. The annual report shall specifically analyze the need to incorporate new local data to comply with the requirement in F.S. § 163.31801, that the fees be based on the most recent and localized data. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to amend this section at any time. 
(6)  Optional annual impact fee increase. The City may, as part of the annual report or at any other time, calculate updated impact fee schedules using appropriate construction cost inflation rates in a nationally recognized publication such as the Engineering News Record (ENR) for the applicable time period. Such annual impact fee updates shall not require issuance of a new technical report. In order for impact fees updated under this subsection to be effective, the updated impact fee schedules shall be adopted by the Commission as an amendment to this ordinance and shall comply with applicable provisions of Florida Statutes, including the notice requirements in F.S. § 163.31801. 
(7)  Triennial review and modification. The City shall conduct a complete review of the impact fees every three (3) years to determine if changes in costs, facility needs, development patterns, demographics, and any other relevant factors indicate a need to update the impact fee calculations, data, methodology or other components of the impact fee system. The triennial report issued based on this review shall be distributed to the Commission by the City Manager. The triennial report may be used to fulfill the annual report requirement for that year. The City shall endeavor to adopt any changes and updates to the impact fee system, including updated fee calculations, within a year of completion of the triennial report. 
(i)  Service charges. Service charges may be established at the option of the Commission. If adopted by resolution of the Commission, the service charges shall be collected from each applicant and shall be distributed as appropriate for impact fee administration, for financial administration, and for costs related to the establishment, amendment and annual review/update of the impact fee ordinance and methodology. The service charge may also be used to defray expenses related to petitions, appeals and/or legal challenges to the impact fee system. The service charge, if adopted, shall be set based upon a review of incurred and anticipated costs to create, administer, update and manage the impact fee system and shall not exceed actual costs to the City. 
(j)  Administrative petitions for impact fee determinations, refunds and credits. 
(1)  Petition process. 
a.  Petitions for an impact fee determination refund of impact fees and/or credit against impact fees shall be submitted using the petition process, requirements and time limits provided herein. All petition requests shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
b.  All petitions shall be submitted to the City Manager for processing and preparation of a staff report and recommendations by the appropriate staff on the petition. The final determination on the petition shall be issued by the City Manager.

The City Manager shall, no later than ninety (90) days after filing of the complete petition, issue a written determination on the petition, with the reasoning for the determination, and, if needed, direct the appropriate City staff to take the actions necessary to implement the determination. 
c.  The City Manager, or authorized representative, is authorized to determine whether a petition is complete and whether additional data or supporting statements by an appropriate professional are needed for evaluation of the petition. Determination of the completeness of a petition is solely at the judgment of the City. If the City Manager, or authorized representative, determines that the petition is not complete, a written statement identifying insufficiencies of the petition shall be provided to the petitioner within thirty (30) days of initial filing of the petition. The date of such written determination of insufficiency shall toll the time limits established in this section until submittal of a complete petition. 
d.  Upon written agreement by the City Manager and the petitioner, the time limits in this section may be waived for any reason, including, but not limited to, the submittal of additional data and supporting statements by the petitioner. 
e.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the filing of a petition shall stay action by the City on the building plan approval and any other City action related to the development. No building plan approval or other City action shall be issued for development for which a petition has been filed unless the total impact fees due, as determined by the City and including any applicable service charge, have been paid in full or a sufficient bond or letter of credit satisfactory to the City Attorney has been filed with the City. 
(2)  Petition for impact fee determination. Any applicant, prior to or in conjunction with the submission of plans for building plan approval or within thirty (30) days of the date of payment of impact fees, may petition the City Manager for a determination that: 
a.  The amount of the impact fees imposed on the new development is inappropriate based on the specific land use category applied to the residential or nonresidential development and/or based on the amount of development (dwelling units and/or gross square footage) used to calculate the impact fees; or 
b.  The impact fees are otherwise unlawfully imposed. 
The petition shall specify in detail the basis on which the applicant asserts that the amount of the impact fees is inappropriate or unlawful. The petition shall be on a form provided by the City and shall, at a minimum, include: identification of the disputed factors, a detailed statement asserting the basis for the dispute, the data relied upon by the petitioner, a detailed statement by a qualified professional engineer, planner or other appropriate professional, and, if filed after payment of impact fees, a dated receipt for payment of the impact fees issued by the collecting agency. The applicant/petitioner shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the City in reviewing and evaluating the petition, including but not limited to, staff time and costs of outside consultants used at the discretion of the City. Failure to timely file a petition for impact fee determination shall waive any right to challenge, review or recalculate the impact fee payment. 
(3)  Petition for refund of impact fees. 
a.  The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may apply for a refund of such fee if: 
1.  The City has failed to appropriate or spend the collected fees by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six (6) years after the date of payment of the impact fee; 
2.  The building plan approval for which the impact fee has been paid has lapsed for non-commencement of construction; or 
3.  The project for which a building plan approval has been issued has been altered resulting in a decrease in the amount of the impact fee due. 
b.  Only the current owner of property may petition for a refund. A petition for refund must be filed within ninety (90) days of any of the above-specified events giving rise to the right to claim a refund. Failure to timely file a petition for refund shall waive any right to an impact fee refund. 
c.  The petition for refund shall be submitted to the City Manager on a form provided by the City for such purpose. The petition shall contain a notarized affidavit that petitioner is the current owner of the property; a certified copy of latest tax records for the City showing the owner of the subject property; a copy of a dated receipt for payment of the Impact Fee on the subject property issued by the City's Planning and Zoning Department; and a statement of the basis upon which the refund is sought. In the case of any uncertainty regarding the petitioner's right to the refund, the petitioner shall be responsible for providing adequate documentation supporting petitioner's legal rights and agreeing to indemnify and defend the City against any other claims to the refund. 
d.  Any money refunded pursuant to this subsection shall be returned with interest at the rate of three (3) percent per annum. 
(4)  Petition for credits against impact fees. 
a.  Any applicant, as defined in this section, who elects to construct or dedicate all or a portion of a system improvement, as defined in this section, or, who escrows money with the City for the construction of a system improvement, may, if all criteria in this section and this subsection (j)(4) are fulfilled, be granted a credit for such contribution against the impact fees otherwise due for the same type of system improvement. The applicant must, prior to the applicant's construction, dedication or escrow of the system improvement, submit a petition on a form provided by the City, obtain a determination of credit eligibility and the amount of any credit, and enter into a credit agreement with the City. The petition for credit shall contain, at a minimum, the following: a certified copy of the most recently recorded deed for the subject property, preliminary engineering plans and certified costs estimates by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional for the proposed improvement, legal description of any land proposed to be contributed, proposed schedule for completion of any construction/dedications, identification of the proposed improvement in the current adopted City CIP and the amount of impact fee funding for the improvement, and identification in detail of the development against which the credits are to apply or which will pay the impact fees to be used for the credit, including the land use type, number of units/gross floor area, anticipated development schedule, and legal descriptions of the subject property. The applicant/petitioner shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the City in reviewing and evaluating the petition, including but not limited to, staff time and costs of outside consultants used at the discretion of the City. Failure to timely file a petition for impact fee determination shall waive any right to challenge, review or recalculate the impact fee payment. Any appeal of petition determinations on credits must be filed, heard, and determined prior to the applicant's construction, dedication or escrow for which the credit is requested. Failure to timely file a petition for impact fee credits shall waive any right to impact fee credits. 
b.  If it is determined that the system improvement is in the adopted, current City capital improvements plan and is funded in whole or in part with City impact fee revenue, the City Manager shall determine the appropriate amount of the credit. The amount of the credit shall be based on actual costs certified by a professional engineer or architect submitted by the applicant and reviewed and approved by the appropriate City department. In no event shall the credit exceed the amount of impact fees budgeted for that system improvement or the amount of the impact fees for the same type of system improvements that are due from the development requesting the credit, whichever amount is smaller. If the impact fees due exceed the amount of credit, the applicant shall pay the impact fees due less the credit at the time of issuance of the building plan approval. 
c.  If a credit petition is approved, the applicant and the City shall enter into a credit agreement which shall provide for, but is not limited to, the following: 
1.  The process to be used to verify actual costs; 
2.  The value of any dedicated land or methodology to determine the value of any dedicated land; 
3.  The obligations and responsibilities of the applicant, including but not limited to: 
(i)  Public bidding requirements; 
(ii)  Engineering, design and construction standards and requirements to be complied with; 
(iii)  Insurance and indemnification requirements; 
(iv)  Project inspection standards and responsibilities;

(vii)  Process for submittal of credit payment requests; and 
(viii)  Timing of payments by the City. 
No impact fee credits shall be paid or provided until any land has been dedicated and conveyed to the City and/or the facilities have been constructed and accepted, or alternatively, until a bond has been posted to ensure the conveyance and/or construction. The City's obligation to pay impact fee credits shall be limited to the impact fees collected from the development for a period not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of approval of the agreement. The credit agreement shall provide for forfeiture of any impact fee credit remaining at the end of such ten (10) year period. The credit applicant shall agree to provide recorded notice to subsequent purchasers/owners of the property regarding the credit, if any, that may be available to such purchasers and shall agree to indemnify the City for any and all costs and liabilities arising from any claims by others related to the impact fee credit. 
(k)  Appeal to City Commission. 
(1)  A petition determination by the City Manager shall be final unless a written notice of appeal to the Commission is filed with the City Manager within 20 days of the date of the written determination by the City Manager, together with payment of a one hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) fee. Such appeal may be filed by the applicant, the petitioner, or by any officer, department, board, commission, or agency of the City. Failure to timely file a request for review of a petition determination shall waive any right to further review of the petition determination. 
(2)  Appeals shall be filed on a form provided by the City and accompanied by ten (10) copies of all documents for consideration by the Commission, including but not limited to, the petition submittal and all accompanying documents, the petition determination, any additional documents, exhibits, technical reports, or other written evidence the appellant wants the Commission to consider. The appeal must include the names of all witnesses, including experts that will testify in support of appellant's appeal with a summary of the testimony of each witness or expert. Should the appellant want to submit additional written material after the initial filing of notice of appeal, ten (10) complete copies of such material shall be submitted to the City Manager no later than thirty (30) days prior to the hearing date. If any material is submitted after that date, the Commission shall reschedule the hearing to a later date to provide adequate time for review of the material by City staff and the City Manager, notwithstanding the ninety (90) day period established under subsection (k)(3) of this section. 
(3)  The Commission on review shall have full power to affirm, reverse, or modify the action of the City Manager so long as such Commission action is based on applicable law and the provisions of this section. The appeal shall be heard by the Commission not more than 90 days after the appeal is filed by the appellant, unless the appellant and City Manager agree in writing to a later time or the appellant submits additional written material less than thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. The decision of the Commission shall be by resolution. 
(4)  If a person decides to judicially appeal any decision made by the City Commission, such person may need a record of proceedings, and for such purpose the person may need to ensure that a verbatim record of proceedings is made which record includes the testimony and evidence upon which the appeal is to be based. 
(l)  Judicial review. Any request for review of a decision by the Commission under this section shall be made by filing an appeal within thirty (30) days of rendition of the Commission's resolution with the circuit court in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
(m)  Effect of the impact fee on zoning and subdivision regulations. This section shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of the property, density of development, design and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the land development regulations or other regulations of the City, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development. 
(n)  Impact fee as additional or supplemental requirement. The payment of impact fees imposed pursuant to this section is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other regulations and requirements imposed by the City on the development of land or the issuance of building plan approval. In no event shall a property owner be required to pay for system improvements related to providing new capacity for new development in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this section; provided, however, that a property owner may be required to provide or pay, pursuant to ordinances, policies or regulations of the City, County or the State, for public facility improvements in addition to payment of impact fees pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a guarantee of adequate public facilities at the time of development of any particular property. 
(o)  Alternative collection method. In the event that the appropriate amount of impact fees due pursuant to this section are not paid prior to the issuance of a building plan approval, the City may elect to collect the impact fees due by any other method which is authorized by law. 
(p)  Liberal construction. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out its purposes in the interest of public health, safety, welfare and convenience. 
(q)  Severability. Should any sentence, clause, part or provision of this section be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of this section as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part declared to be invalid.

(c)  The City shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records showing the gross subscriber revenues from which its license payments are computed and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this chapter. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder; however, an accounting rendered to the City and to which no exception is made within three (3) years after receipt by the City shall be deemed to be accurate and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by the City against the grantee. 
(d)  The City may cause an independent audit to be made of grantee's records at City expense; provided, however, that if the audit reveals that grantee's revenues, or payments to the City, have been understated by five (5) percent or more, the expense of the audit shall be borne by the grantee.

(2)  Support its credit and attract necessary capital under efficient and economical management; 
(3)  Provide a return to equity owners commensurate with current returns on investment in other enterprises having corresponding risks. 
(c)  No rate established shall afford any undue preference or advantage among subscribers, but separate rates may be established for separate classes of subscribers and rates may reflect the increased cost of providing service to isolated or sparsely populated areas.

Such application may be made before, at or within six (6) months after payment of the prescribed fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the City Manager may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on such commerce. The City Manager shall then conduct an investigation, comparing applicant's business with other businesses of like nature and shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed by this division is unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to applicant's business and shall fix as the permit fee for the applicant an amount that is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or, if the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the City Manager shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fees as prescribed by subsection (a) hereof. Should the City Manager determine the gross sales measure of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the City or at the end of each three (3) month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and pay the amount of fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any one (1) calendar year shall be required after the permittee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual fee as prescribed in subsection (a) above.

Such agent shall not be an officer or employee of the business enterprise (as defined herein). Copies of all written express instructions for towing shall be maintained by both the property owner or agent and the business enterprise to be made available for review by the Police Department. The term "express instruction" shall not mean a general request unrelated to a specific and individual vehicle or which precedes in time the actual parking of a vehicle. 
    License means that certificate or document itself which permits a business enterprise to engage in the activity of recovering, towing, removing and storing of parked vehicles from private real property at the express instruction of the owners of such real property.

(b)  The requirement for a license hereinabove described is a requirement separate and apart from and in addition to any County or municipal requirements for "occupational licenses" and Dade County Towing License under section 30-462 of the Dade County Code.

(d)  Applicability. 
(1)  This article shall be uniformly applicable to all new development/connections as defined in this article, and the appropriate capacity fee, and applicable service charge, shall be collected prior to approval of a sewer allocation, as defined in this article, except where a sewer allocation is approved for additions, remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure or reconstruction of a damaged or destroyed structure, whether voluntary or involuntary, which result in no net increase in the demand for sanitary sewer capacity. The applicant has the burden of submitting documentation to the City proving the type and amount of previously existing development or use for determination by the City of the net increase for calculation of capacity fees due. No refund of capacity fees previously paid shall be provided for any decrease in the amount or type of development except as provided under subsection (j)(3) of this section. 
(2)  Where this article becomes applicable due to: 
a.  Additions, remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure; 
b.  Reconstruction of a damaged or destroyed structure, whether voluntary or involuntary; 
c.  A change in the use of a structure or land that increases the demand for public facilities; 
d.  An increase in the number of residential dwelling units for a residential structure; or 
e.  An increase in the gross square footage of a nonresidential structure; 
the amount of the capacity fees shall be based solely upon the net increase in the demand for sanitary sewer facilities based on a comparison of the capacity fees calculated for the prior development/use to the capacity fees calculated for the proposed development/use. The applicant has the burden of submitting satisfactory documentation to the City proving the type and amount of previously existing use/development for use by the City in determining the net increase for calculation of capacity fees due. 
(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) or (2) above, this article shall not be applicable to Applications for Service approved by the City prior to 8:00 a.m. on September 19, 2007, when the applicant proceeds to issuance of certificate of occupancy without invalidation, suspension or abandonment of the corresponding sewer allocation approval. 
(e)  Establishment of capacity fee district. In furtherance of the implementation of this article, the Commission hereby establishes the sanitary sewer capacity fee benefit district, which boundary is identical with the boundary of the City, as may be adjusted from time to time. 
(f)  Imposition of capacity fees. No sewer allocation approval shall be issued by the City for new development/connection in the City unless the applicant therefor has paid the applicable capacity fee imposed by this article, and applicable service charge if established by resolution of the Commission. Any sewer allocation approved for new development/connections without payment by the applicant and collection by the City of the capacity fee, and service charge if applicable, shall be null and void. 
(g)  Calculation of capacity fee and capacity fee schedule. 
(1)  The City shall calculate the capacity fee due under this article by: 
a.  Determining the water meter size and type needed to serve the new development/connection and identifying the appropriate capacity fee in the fee schedule in subsection (2) below. 
b.  Where a final petition determination has been made by the City Manager or a final decision issued by the Commission after a timely appeal, the capacity fees due shall be calculated based on the petition determination or Commission decision. 
(2)  Applicable sanitary sewer capacity fee schedule as of 8:00 a.m., September 19, 2007: 
Meter Size 
(inches)* Meter Type Capacity Fee 0.75 Displacement $4,105.00 1.00 Displacement $6,839.00 1.50 Displacement/Turbine $13,103.00 2.00 Displacement/Turbine $20,833.00 3.00 Displacement $39,300.00 3.00 Compound $41,907.00 3.00 Turbine $46,976.00 4.00 Compound $66,637.00 4.00 Turbine $80,342.00  
*Sanitary sewer capacity fees for meters larger than four (4) inches shall be calculated based on annualized average day demand and the capital cost per gallon of capacity plus the cost per customer as identified in the Technical Report. 
(h)  Administration of capacity fees. 
(1)  Collection of capacity fee and service charge. Capacity fees calculated and imposed pursuant to this article shall be collected by the collecting agency prior to approval of a sewer allocation. If adopted by resolution of the Commission, the service charge shall be collected by the collecting agency at the same time as collection of the capacity fees. 
(2)  Accounting and reporting of capacity fee collections and expenditures. Capacity fees shall be transferred from the collecting agency to the City Finance Department which shall be responsible for placement of such funds into the appropriate separate account for the capacity fee. The service charge, if adopted by resolution of the Commission, shall be placed in a separate account identified for management of the capacity fee system and disbursed as set forth in this article. The City Finance Department shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each such account which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all moneys received, including revenue by sewer allocation approval, and which shall document and ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively in accordance with provisions of this article. For purposes of petitions for refunds under subsection (j)(3) of this section, the expenditure and appropriation of capacity fees shall be deemed to occur in the same sequential order as the collection of capacity fees, in other words, the first fee in shall be the first fee out. 
(3)  Trust funds established. 
a.  There is hereby established a separate capacity fee trust fund. Funds withdrawn from this account must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of subsection (4) of this section. 
b.  Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in an interest-bearing account. Interest earned by such account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds of such account. The funds of these accounts shall not be commingled with other funds or revenues of the City. 
(4)  Use of funds collected. Capacity fees collected pursuant to this article shall be expended only for System Improvements, as defined in this article, and only within the capacity fee benefit district. Capacity fees shall not be expended to eliminate any deficiencies in facilities, land or equipment related to existing development or that may result from adoption of an increased level of service. The funds collected by reason of this article shall be used exclusively for the purpose of funding System Improvements or for financing directly, or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates and other obligations of indebtedness, the costs of system improvements. 
(5)  Annual review and modification. Beginning with adoption of the fiscal year 2009-2010 budget, the City shall annually, no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the annual capital budget and capital improvements program adoption process, review the capacity fee ordinance procedures, assumptions, formulas, benefit district designations, and fee calculations, and issue an annual report. The annual report shall be distributed to the Commission by the City Manager. The annual report should, at a minimum, include information by individual benefit district and facility type on account balances, annual collections, annual expenditures, and System Improvement projects funded in whole or in part with capacity fees. The annual report should present any recommendations related to the capacity fee system, including but not limited to, the need for any updates to the capacity fee calculations, district boundaries, and ordinance. In reviewing the capacity fee system, the City may consider any factors relevant to determining the need for additional capacity, facilities and equipment. The data in the annual report may be organized based on the City's fiscal year or calendar year. The annual report shall review the amount of service charges collected and the costs associated with the creation, administration, management and updating of the capacity fee system and shall provide recommendations on any changes to the amount of the service charge. The annual report shall specifically analyze the need to incorporate new local data to comply with the requirement in section 163.31801, F.S. that the fees be based on the most recent and localized data. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to amend this article at any time. 
(6)  Optional annual fee increase. The City may, as part of the annual report or at any other time, calculate an updated sanitary sewer capacity fee schedule using appropriate construction cost inflation rate(s) in a nationally recognized publication such as the Engineering News Record (ENR) for the applicable time period. Such annual fee updates shall not require issuance of a new Technical Report. In order for fees updated under this subsection to be effective, the updated sanitary sewer capacity fee schedule shall be adopted by the Commission as an amendment to this ordinance and shall comply with the notice requirements in section 163.31801, F.S. Fulfillment of the requirements of section 163.31801, F.S. shall not constitute an admission by the City that section 163.31801, F.S. is applicable to the capacity fees established in this article. 
(7)  Triennial review and modification. The City shall conduct a complete review of the capacity fees every three years to determine if changes in costs, facility needs, development patterns, demographics, and any other relevant factors indicate a need to update the capacity fee calculations, data, methodology or other components of the capacity fee system. The triennial report issued based on this review shall be distributed to the Commission by the City Manager. The triennial report may be used to fulfill the annual report requirement for that year. The City shall endeavor to adopt any changes and updates to the capacity fee system, including updated fee calculations, within a year of completion of the triennial report. 
(i)  Service charge. Service charges may be established at the option of the Commission. If adopted by resolution of the Commission, the service charges shall be collected from each applicant and shall be distributed as appropriate for capacity fee administration, for financial administration, and for costs related to the establishment, amendment and annual review/update of the capacity fee ordinance and methodology. The service charge may also be used to defray expenses related to petitions, appeals and/or legal challenges to the capacity fee system. The service charge, if adopted, shall be set based upon a review of incurred and anticipated costs to create, administer, update and manage the capacity fee system and shall not exceed actual costs to the City.

Editor's note- Nonamendatory Ord. No. 96-01, §§ 1-10, has been included herein as Ch. 17, Art. II at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 17-21. - Authority. 
    The City is authorized by the provisions of F.S. ch. 166 and the Florida Constitution to construct, reconstruct, improve and extend stormwater utility systems and to issue revenue bonds and other debts if needed to finance in whole or part the cost of such system and to establish just and equitable rates, fees and charges for the services and facilities provided by the system; and is mandated by F.S. §§ 403.0981 and 403.0983 to implement stormwater management systems; and is authorized by F.S. § 403.0983 to generate revenue from service charges assessed as part of a stormwater utility. 
(Ord. No. 96-01, § 1, 8-7-1996) 
Sec. 17-22. - Findings and determinations. 
    It is hereby found, determined and declared as follows: 
(1)  Those elements of the system which provide for the collection of and disposal of storm and surface water and regulation of groundwater are of benefit and provide services to all property within the City including property not presently served by the storm elements of the system. 
(2)  The cost of operating and maintaining the City stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extension thereof should, to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the benefits enjoyed and services received therefrom. 
(Ord. No. 96-01, § 2, 8-7-1996) 
Sec. 17-23. - A management system fee. 
(a)  A fee is hereby imposed upon each developed lot and parcels within the City for services and facilities provided by the stormwater management system. The ordinance and the fees imposed hereunder shall be reviewed by the City Commission on or about September 1 of each year, or through the yearly budget process. For purposes of imposing the stormwater fee, all lots and parcels within the City are classified into the following two (2) customer classes: 
(1)  Residential. 
(2)  Non-residential. 
The City Manager or his/her designee is directed to prepare a list of lots and parcels within the City and assign a classification of residential or commercial to each lot or parcel. 
(b)  There is hereby established the following procedures and criteria used to determine rates for the services and facilities of the municipal stormwater management system: 
(1)  The City Commission, upon recommendation by the City Manager, hereby establishes reasonable rates for management systems for each living residential unit including duplex, triplex and multi-family units; each residence shall be billed at a flat fee as established herein by the City Commission for a single family equivalent unit. A single family equivalent unit (SFEU) is hereby defined as the statistical average horizontal impervious area of single family detached residences in the City of West Miami which have been appraised as single family residences by the Dade County Property Appraisers Office. The total impervious area of a single family residence includes all areas covered by structures and impervious amenities, such as but not limited to roof tops, patios, porches and driveways. In the City of West Miami a single family equivalent unit (SFEU) equals one thousand four hundred (1,400) square feet. 
(2)  For all non-residential and commercial properties, that is enterprise, business establishment, building, or other occupancy not covered by subsections (a) of this section, the rate shall be computed based on the total square footage [of] impervious area of the property divided by the average impervious area of a single family equivalent unit times the rate established for a single family equivalent unit. The billing amount shall be updated by the City Manager based on any additions to the impervious areas. 
(Ord. No. 96-01, § 3, 8-7-1996) 
Sec. 17-24. - Schedule of rates. 
    The following rates are hereby established within the City of West Miami: 
(1)  The rates to be charged for management for each single family residence or dwelling unit shall be one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per month. 
(2)  The rates to be charged for commercial properties, i.e., all other occupants other than provided for in subsection (1) of this section, shall be the rate established in subsection (1) (one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per month) multiplied by the number of single family equivalent units. Single family equivalent unit equals the total square footage of impervious area of the property divided by one thousand four hundred (1,400) square feet (statistically developed average for a single family residence in the City of West Miami). Single-family equivalent units will be rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1) of a unit. With a minimum charge of E.R.U. or one dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) per month. 
(3)  The (SFEU) shall be calculated and established annually by the City Manager, upon approval by the City Commission of the expense and revenue budgets for the stormwater management division of the City's Public Works Department. 
Sec. 17-25. - Collection of charge. 
(a)  The stormwater utility fee is to be paid as billed by the owner, tenant or occupant of each lot or parcel which is subject to the fee. 
(b)  All real properties within the corporate limits of the City of West Miami shall be subject to the payment and collection of the utility charges established by this ordinance. Exempt properties shall be public rights-of-way and alleyways dedicated by plat or deed, public drainage canals, wetlands, and other bodies of water determined to be non-contributory; except those water bodies fitted with impervious surfaces, linings, or bottoms, and retention basins, shall not be exempt. [Note: This means that City property is also subject to payment of the fees; just as are all churches and synagogues, schools and other government-owned lands.] 
(c)  All construction sites will be assessed from the date that a permit from new construction is issued, based on the methodology established by this ordinance. Adjustments will be made under the guidelines of section 17-26 of this ordinance, in the case of expired permits where no construction has taken place. 
(d)  A late charge shall be automatically imposed upon any delinquent account in the amount of ten (10) percent of the prior billing period's unpaid utility charge, and it shall be added to the next subsequent billing. The City of West Miami shall have a lien for delinquent or unpaid utility fee. Enforcement and foreclosure of said liens(s) shall be as provided by law.

This article shall not be construed or interpreted to mean that property subject to the fees and charges established herein will always, or at any time, be free of flooding or flood damage; or that systems capable of handling all storm events can be cost-effectively constructed, operated or maintained. This ordinance shall not create any liability on the part of, or cause of action against the City of West Miami, or any official or employee thereof, for any flood damage that may result from such storms or the runoff or flooding resulting therefrom. This article does not purport to reduce the need, or eliminate the necessity for individual property owners to obtain flood insurance. The City, through the City Commission and the administration, shall have full discretion as to how the funds from this article shall be allocated. 
(Ord. No. 96-01, § 9, 8-7-1996) 
Sec. 17-30. - Private facilities. 
    The property owner shall be responsible for drainage within the property, and for all facilities located on private property. The owner shall clean and maintain the facilities to ensure efficient and proper operation, and shall obtain approval of the Public Works Director, or his designee, for any proposed modifications to the private drainage system. The utility shall perform inspections inside the private facilities, and may require of the owner that maintenance, repairs, or replacements of the facilities be performed, based upon the severity of problems, sources of pollutants, and of potential hazards to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 96-01, § 10, 8-7-1996) 
Sec. 17-31. - Severability. 
    Should any part of this article be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining portions hereof shall not be affected and shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 2A. Special Use Permits: Generally (85-01)
2A.l. Intent, Generally.
In addition to zoning procedures and requirements relating generally to
issuance of building permits and certificates of use, a Special Use Permit system is
hereby established. It is intended that this system shall assure special examination,
review, and findings by appropriate agents, agencies, or bodies of the City in connection
with proposed actions particularly specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
Special Use Permit procedures and requirements as set out herein are
intended to apply in relation to use, occupancy, location, construction, design,
character, scale, manner of operation, or the necessity for making complex or unusual
determinations; also to assure consideration of the particular circumstances of each
case and the establishment of such conditions and safeguards as are reasonably
necessary for protection of the public interest generally, and protection of the adjacent
properties, the neighborhood, and the City as a whole.
In establishing this Special Use Permit system, it is intended to increase
efficiency and reduce time required for processing applications by relating
administrative responsibilities and procedural requirements to the degree of complexity
and potential impact of the matters being considered.
A Special Use Permit is a grant of authority under the terms of this Zoning
ordinance from and by a designated agent, officer, or body of the City to an applicant for
the use of property in the manner set out in the grant of Special Use Permit uses or
occupancies requiring Special Use Permits, and the type of Special Use Permit required
in each instance, are set out in the Official Schedule of District Regulations or
elsewhere in this zoning ordinance.
2A.2 Intent; Special Use Permit
Within the City generally, or within certain zoning districts, certain structures,
uses, and/or occupancies specified in this ordinance are of a nature requiring special
and intensive review to determine whether or not they should be permitted in specific
locations, and if so, the special limitations, conditions, and safeguards which should be
applied as reasonably necessary to promote the general purpose of this Zoning
Ordinance, and, in particular, to protect adjoining properties and the neighborhood from
avoidable potentially adverse effects. It is further intended that the expertise and
judgment of the City council be exercised in making such determinations, in accordance
with the rules, considerations, and limitations relating to special use Permits. Formal
public notice and hearing is mandatory for Special Use Permits.
2A.3 Special Use Permits: Intent; Determination by City Commission; Referrals
It is intended that Special Use Permits be required where specified uses
and/or occupancies involve matters deemed to be of city-wife or area-wide importance.
The City Commission shall be solely responsible for determinations on
applications for Special Use Permits.
The City Commission shall refer all applications for Special Use Permits to
the Planning and Zoning Board for recommendations, and may make referrals to other
agencies, bodies, or officers for review, analysis, and/or technical findings and
determinations and reports thereon.
2A.4 Variance Not Special Use Permit
A variance granted under this Zoning Ordinance is not to be considered as a
Special Use Permit and the requirements herein set out for Special Use Permits shall
not govern the procedures or standards for grant of variance.
2A.5 Relation of Special Use Permits to Building Permits or Certificates of Use; To
Initiation or Maintenance of Use or Occupancy
Where building permits or certificates of use are required by this Zoning
Ordinance or other codes or ordinances of the City, no such Building Permit or
Certificate of Use shall be issued where this ordinance requires Special Use Permits
unless and until any and all Special Use Permits required have been obtained. Where
uses or occupancies do not require Building Permits or Certificates of Use, but are
otherwise subject to requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, no such use or occupancy
shall be initiated or maintained unless and until any and all Special use Permits herein
in relation thereto have been obtained.
2A.6 Special Use Permits to be Issued or Denied in Accordance With Procedures,
Standards, and Requirements of This Ordinance
Special Use Permits relating to this Zoning Ordinance shall be required only
where specific provision therefore is made by this Zoning Ordinance. No application for
a Special Use Permit shall be accepted or approved unless specific provision for the
particular Special Use Permit appears in this Zoning Ordinance.
Special Use Permits in relation to zoning shall be issued or denied only in
accordance with the procedures, standards, and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
Where application for Special Use Permits demonstrate that general and special
standards and requirements for such Special Use Permits are met, the agent, agency,
or body of the City herein made responsible for the grant of such Special Use; Permit
shall issue such permit subject to conditions and safeguards required in the particular
circumstances of the case and as authorized and limited at Section 2A.21, Conditions
and Safeguards, below.
Where applications for Special use permits indicate that actions proposed
therein, or the manner in which they are proposed to be conducted, do not meet the
standards and requirements of this Ordinance, and could not practically and reasonably
be made to do so by attachment of conditions and safeguards so authorized and
limited, such applications and permits shall be denied.
2A.7 Action to be Taken Within Time Limits Specified.
Unless applications be withdrawn or applicants agree to time extensions,
actions on Special Use Permits shall be taken within time limits specified in this Zoning
ordinance.
2A.8 Applications for Special Use Permits; When Filed Who May File.
Except when specifically set out otherwise in this Zoning Ordinance,
applications for special permits shall be filed with administrative officials designated by
the City Manager and such designees are charged with responsibility for their receipt,
fee collection, processing and/or distribution.

by the property owner, his formally designated agent, or a lessee with formal and legally

apply generally, in addition to any other standards and requirements set forth
concerning the class or kind of permit being considered. City agents, agencies, or
boards charged with decisions concerning Special Use 'Permits shall make, or cause to
be made, written findings and determinations concerning such of the following matters
as are applicable in the case, shall reflect such considerations and standards in their
decisions as to issuance of permits, with or without conditions and safeguards, or denial
of applications.
2A.14 Ingress and Egress.
Due consideration shall be given to adequacy of ingress and egress to the
property and structure and uses thereon, with particular reference to automotive and
pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or
other emergency. Adequacy of ingress and egress to the special use is required. In
relation to the proposed special use and its traffic impact within and off the site,,
adequacy of ingress and egress shall be measured by standard and acceptable traffic
engineering and projections, standards, and methods of determinations of:
(a) Safety and convenience of vehicular traffic
entering and leaving the site;
(b) Safety and convenience of pedestrian movement
in relation to such movement and to vehicular traffic;
(c) General access of residents, employees, and
visitors to,, from, and within the site;
(d) Access to and within the site in the event of

Due consideration shall be given to off-street parking and loading facilities as
related to adjacent streets, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety
and convenience, internal traffic flow and control, arrangement in relation to access in
case of fire or other emergency, and screening and landscaping. It is the intent of these
Special Use Permit regulations that off-street parking facilities for special use shall be
provided in such locations and amounts within the development (or on adjacent or
nearby sites where approved for such purpose at the time that special use approval is
granted) so that residents, visitors, and employees arriving at the development by
automotive vehicle will not have to park on City streets or in non-special use related
parking facilities. It is the intent of these Special Use Permit regulations that off-street
facilities for the loading or unloading of goods and products shall be provided in such
locations and amounts that such activity, can be conducted off City streets without
inconvenience to passenger automotive flow into and from the special use approval and

development shall take into consideration rapid transit or other modes of mass transit
potential, if any, to and from the site, and shall be based upon standard traffic
engineering and architectural projections, standards, and practices and shall also
consider by way of safety and convenience:
(a) Relationship of such facilities to adjacent streets, as presently existing
or as they may be improved or patterns changed as a condition to granting Special Use
Permit.
(b) Pedestrian circulation and relationships to proposed facilities.
(c) Internal traffic flow and control within the site of the proposed special
use.
(d) Arrangement of such facilities in relation to
fire, crime or other emergency or catastrophe.
(e) Screening or landscaping of such facilities to minimize visual impact of
such facilities by viewers from off the site of the proposed special use.
2A.16 Refuse and Service Areas
Due consideration shall be given to the location, scale, design, and screening
of refuse and service areas; to the manner in which refuse is to be stored; and to the
manner and timing of refuse collection and deliveries, shipments, or other service
activities, as such matters relate to the location and nature of uses on adjoining
properties and to the location and character of adjoining public ways, so as to minimize
impact to such areas.
2A.17 Signs and Lighting
Due consideration shall be given to the number, size, character, location, and

recharge of ground water supply on the property, temporary retention with gradual
discharge, or other remedial measures.
2A.20 Control of Potentially Adverse Effects Generally
In addition to consideration of detailed elements indicated above, as
appropriate to the particular class or kind of Special Use Permit and the circumstances
of the particular case, due consideration shall be given to potentially adverse effects
generally on adjoining and nearby properties, the area, the neighborhood, or the City, of
the use or occupancy as proposed, or its location, construction, design, character, scale
or manner of operation. Where such potentially adverse effects are found,
consideration shall be given to special remedial measures appropriate in the particular
circumstances of the case, including screening or buffering, landscaping, control of
manner of hours of operation, alteration of proposed design or construction of buildings,
change in site of buildings, relocation of proposed open space or alteration of use of
such space, changes in traffic patterns, improvement of streets, or such other measures
as are required to assure that such potential adverse effects will be eliminated or
minimized to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, and that the use of occupancy
will be compatible and harmonious with other development in the area to a degree
which will avoid substantial depreciation of the value of nearby property.

Section 2B. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. (90-1)
2B.I. Planned Development:
Intent and applicability within certain zoning districts, it is intended that new planned
developments, as defined herein, are permissible after grant of special use permit, in
the manner and subject to the general and particular standards and requirements set
out in this Section 2B.
It is intended that this Planned Development Ordinance shall be utilized
where land development or redevelopment is located within all zoning districts except in
R-1 districts same is permissible. In R-1 and R-2 zoning districts no planned
development shall be approved where there is a proposed increase in residential
density, and/or change of the use district. It is further the intent and purpose of this
Section that the planned development concept be utilized to promote efficient and
economical land use in an urban setting, cooperation in development between the
public and private sectors, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious
variety in physical development, creative design, improved living environments, orderly
and economical development in the City, and the protection of existing and future City
development. Planned development is suitable for development, redevelopment, and
the conservation of the land and other resources of the City of West Miami. Within
planned developments, regulations for implementing unified planning and development
are intended to accomplish the purposes of existing zoning and other applicable
regulations to an equivalent or greater degree than in circumstances where regulations
are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot rather than a unified basis. In view
of the substantial public advantages of planned development, it is the intent of this
subsection to promote and encourage development or redevelopment in this form.
Planned developments shall be so related to and be consistent with the general
development pattern and objectives of the adopted West Miami Comprehensive Plan as
to provide for the comfort and convenience of occupants, facilitate protection of the
character of surrounding neighborhoods, and reduce general traffic congestion by a
reasonably close relationship (either in distance or in time) between origins and
destinations of persons living, working, or visiting such developments. Housing,
commercial, service facilities, and principal places of employment for and in planned
developments shall be so related either by physical proximity or by major street
networks, or by mass transit, or other modes of transit, as to promote these objectives.
2B.2. Planned Development; Definitions.
For the purpose of these planned development regulations, certain words or
phrases are defined as follows:
2B.2-1. Planned Development. A planned development is:
(a) Land under unified control, to be planned and developed as a whole;
(b) In a single development operation or an approved, definitely
programmed and staged series of development operations, including all lands,
buildings, structures, and development;
(c) For principal and accessory uses and structures substantially related
to the character and purposes of the particular planned development and the zoning
district in which it is located;
(d) According to comprehensive and detailed plans that include not only
streets, utilities, lots, or building sites and the like, but also site plans, conceptual floor
plans and conceptual elevations for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed,
used, and related to each other, and detailed plans for other uses and improvements on
the land as related to the buildings; and
(e) With a program for provision, operation, and maintenance of such
areas, improvements, facilities, and services as will be for common use by some or all
of the occupants or employees of, or visitors to, the planned development but will not be
provided, operated, or maintained at general public expense.
2B.2-2. Special Use Permit for Planned Development.
As used in this subsection, a special use permit for planned development is a
permit granted in the exercise of the quasi-judicial authority of the City Commission of
West Miami, according to the procedures and the general and particular standards
herein set out, for the design, development, construction, and erection of a planned
development. Phrases such as approval of special use for planned development,
approval of planned development, and the like are synonymous with a special use
permit for planned development. The special use permit for planned development is to
be considered a special exception as that term is used generally in Florida zoning law.
2B.3. Planned Development; Relations of Planned Development Regulations to General
Zoning, Subdivision,, or other City Regulations and Comprehensive Plan.
The planned development regulations set out in this subsection shall apply
generally to the initiation of applications for approval and regulation of all planned
developments. Where there are conflicts between the planned development regulations
herein set out and general City zoning, subdivision, or other regulations and
requirements, these planned development regulations shall apply to all planned
developments approved as special uses after the effective date of this ordinance,
unless the City Commission shall find, in the particular case that:
(1) Provisions herein set out do not serve public purposes to a degree at
least equivalent to general City zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or
requirements, or
(2) Actions, designs, construction, or other solutions proposed by the
applicant, although not literally in accord with these planned development regulations of
this Subsection 2B, satisfy public purposes to at least an equivalent or greater degree.
It is specifically provided, however, that where floor area and similar ratios and/or
residential or other densities have been generally established by the City's zoning
ordinance for a particular type of zoning district or in particular areas of the City, the City
Commission shall not act in a particular case to alter the said ratios and/or residential
densities. It is specifically provided further that no planned development shall be
approved that is inconsistent with the adopted West Miami Comprehensive Plan.
Notwithstanding procedures and requirements generally in effect for zoning in the City
of West Miami, procedures and general standards, guides, guarantees, conditions,
safeguards, requirements and other provisions set out in this Subsection 2B, shall apply
for all planned developments and to the issuance of all permits construction therein.
2B.4. Planned Developments; Where Permitted General Standards and Requirements.
Planned developments shall hereafter be established only upon approval of a
special use permit by the City Commission therefore, where lands suitable in location
and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed as
units, according to the requirements, standards, and procedures set out in this
Subsection 2B for planned development and standards and requirements for the
particular type of planned development involved. Planned developments shall be
appropriately located with respect to intended functions, to the pattern and timing of
development existing or proposed in the adopted West Miami Comprehensive Plan, and
to public and private facilities, existing or clearly funded and programmed to be
available by the time the planned development reaches the stage where such facilities
will be needed.
In reaching its ultimate decision as to whether or not approval should be
given by the City Commission, with or without added conditions, modifications,
safeguards, or stipulations, to a special use application for planned development, or
whether the application should be denied, the following general standards and
requirements shall be met, or determined not to have been met (and, in addition, any
particular additional requirements herein set out relating to the particular type of planned
development shall be met, or determined not to have been met):
2B.4-1. Relation to Major Transportation Facilities.
Planned developments shall be so located with respect to mass transit and
other mode of transit, expressways, arterial and collector streets, or other transportation
facilities as to provide direct access to and from such planned developments without
creating substantial increase in traffic along minor streets in existing or prospective
residential neighborhoods outside the proposed planned development.
2B.4-2. Relation to Public Utilities, Facilities, and services.
(a) Planned developments shall be so located in relation to sanitary
sewers, water lines, storm and surface water drainage systems, and other utility
systems and installations that neither extension-nor enlargement of such systems will
be required in manner, form, character, location degree, scale, or timing resulting in
higher net public costs or earlier incursion of public costs than would development in
forms generally permitted under existing zoning for the area.
(b) Planned developments shall be so located with respect to other
necessary public facilities, such as streets, mass transit, and other modes of transit,
parks, schools, and the like, as to have access to such facilities in the same degree as
would development permitted under existing zoning.
(c) Planned developments shall be so located, designed and scaled that
access for public services is equivalent to, and net cost for services is not greater than,
access and net costs for public services for development as permitted under existing
zoning.
(d) However, if applicants for planned development will:
(1) provide private facilities, utilities, or services approved by
appropriate public agencies as substituting on an equivalent basis, and assure their
satisfactory continuing operation and maintenance on a permanent basis or until similar
public utilities, facilities, or services are available and used, and/or
(2) make provision acceptable to the City or other involved
governmental agency, for off-setting any added not public cost or costs or early
commitment of public funds made necessary by such planned development, special use
approval for the planned development may be given. Decisions reached under this
paragraph, when this paragraph is utilized, shall be attached as one of the conditions,
stipulations, or safeguards to any special use approval for planned development, if such
approval be granted. (e) In computing "net public costs" as set out by Section 2B.4-2 (a)
through (d) above, the difference in anticipated public installation, operation, and
maintenance costs and the difference in anticipated public revenue from the proposed
planned development shall be determined. Expenses involved in making such
determinations as may be required in establishing added net public costs shall be paid
by the applicants for planned development. Determination in such matters shall be
made by the City or by experts acceptable to the City.
2B.4-3. Physical Character of the Site: Relation to Surrounding Property.
The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without
hazards to persons or property, on or off the land, from probability of flooding, erosion,
subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers, annoyances, or inconveniences.
Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and topography shall all be appropriate
to both the kind and pattern of use intended. The site shall meet all requirements for
development as proposed under the South Florida Building Code and other applicable
City, County, State or Federal laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. If
appropriate to the form of planned development, lands to be included in planned
developments may be divided by public or approved private streets, alleys, paths,
bicycle paths, people movers, rights-of-way, or easements, but the site shall be so
located, dimensioned, and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and
to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary
protection against adverse relationships between or among uses in the planned
development and uses in surrounding
areas.
2B.4-4. Ingress and Egress; Traffic Flow and Control.
Adequacy of ingress and egress to the proposed planned development is
required. In relation to the proposed planned development and its traffic impact within
and off the site, adequacy of ingress and egress shall be measured by standard and
acceptable traffic engineering projections, standards, and methods in determination of:
(a) Safety and convenience of vehicular traffic entering and leaving
the site.
(b) Safety and convenience of pedestrian movement in relation to
such movement and to vehicular traffic.
(c) General access of residents, employees, and visitors to, from
and. within the site.
(d) Access to and within the site in the event of fire, crime, or other
emergency or catastrophe.
(e) Traffic flow and control generally, with determinations to be
based upon existing street patterns, or future patterns and improvements as they may
be decided as a condition of approval of the special use permit for planned
development. Where mass transit or other modes of transit is a major consideration in
a proposed planned development, the relationship of such facilities shall be a part of
consideration of traffic flow and control.
21B.4-5. Off-street Loading and Off-street Parking
It is the intent of these planned development regulations that off-street
parking facilities for planned developments shall be provided in such locations and
amounts within the development (or on adjacent or nearby sites where approved for
such purpose at the time that special use approval for planned development is granted)
so that residents, visitors, and employees arriving at the development by automotive
vehicle will not have to park on City streets or in non-planned development-related
parking facilities.
It is the intent of these planned development regulations that off-street facilities for the
loading or unloading of goods and products shall be provided in such locations and
amounts that such activity can be conducted off City streets without inconvenience to
passenger automotive flow into and from the planned development and without
inconvenience to the parking of passenger automotive vehicles. Determinations as to
location and amounts of off-street parking and off-street loading within the development
shall take into consideration mass transit or other modes of transit potential, if any, to
and from the site, and shall be based upon standard traffic engineering and architectural
projections, standards, and practices and shall also consider by way of safety and
convenience:
(a) Relationship of such facilities to adjacent streets, as presently
existing or as they may be improved or patterns changed as a condition to granting
special use approval for planned development.
(b) Pedestrian circulation and relationships to the proposed
facilities.
(c) Internal traffic flow and control within the site of the proposed
planned development.
(d) Arrangement of such facilities in relation to fire, crime, or other

signs, and of proposed lighting for signs and premises shall be such as provide for the
safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and for compatibility and harmony with nearby
and adjacent properties and the general character of the area.
2B.4-8. Control of Potentially Adverse Effects Generally.
When, in the course of consideration of an application for planned
development under these regulations, it is determined that potentially adverse effects
will result from the planned development as proposed, on adjacent or nearby properties,
the area, the neighborhood, or the City, consideration shall be given to special remedial
measures appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case such as screening or
buffering, landscaping, control of manner or hours of operation, changes in proposed
construction or design of buildings, changes in siting of buildings, relocation of proposed
open space or alteration of use of such space, changes in traffic patterns, improvement
of streets, or such other measures as are required in order to insure that such potential
adverse effects will be eliminated or minimized] to the maximum extent reasonably

recorded in writing, and shall become part of the record of the case. All such
recommendations shall be supported by the stated reasons for the proposal for change.
Applicants shall in writing indicate their agreement to such recommendations, with or
without reservations, or their disagreement, with reasons therefore, and such response
by applicants shall also be included in the record. To the extent that there is agreement
as to changes, the original application and materials submitted therewith may be altered
before further processing.

Section 2G. Consistency and Concurrency
Determinations
(a) Generally.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to describe the requirements and
procedures for determination of consistency of proposed development projects with the
City of West Miami's Comprehensive Plan, including meeting the concurrent
requirements of the plan.
Concurrency. A condition where specified facilities and services have or will have
the necessary capacity to meet the adopted level of service standard at the time of
impact of the development project.
(b) Determination of Consistency. All development in the City of West Miami
shall be consistent with City's Comprehensive Plan and this Zoning Ordinance. Where
Zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan, then and in that
event, all development shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
(c) System for the Management of Concurrency.
(1) Generally. The following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as
the System for the Management of Concurrency (SYMCON). The SYMCON is based
upon the City Comprehensive Plan, especially the Capital Improvements Element and
adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure that the issuance
of a Final Development Order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of
service for specified public facilities and services. The SYMCON also includes a
monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public
facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards.
(2) Adopted Levels of Service Shall Not Be Degraded.
A. General Rule. All applications for development orders shall demonstrate that
the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the City. An
application for a development permit shall demonstrate that the proposed development
does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under
which the permit is sought, and no development order is required prior to the issuance
of the permit, e.g. a residence on a parcel of unplatted land. The latest point, at which
concurrency is determined is the final development order. If no development is
required, the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a
site.
B. Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prescribed levels of service
may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities, if upon completion of
the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met.
3. Determination of Availability Capacity. For the purpose of these regulations
the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by:
A. Adding Together
1. The total capacity of existing facilities operating
at the required level of service; and
2. The total capacity of new facilities, if any, that will become available on or
before the date of occupancy of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be
counted only if one or more of the following is shown:
a. Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of issuance
of the final development order.
b. The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the
construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the
final development order.
c. The new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development
agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to,
development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Fla. Statutes., or an agreement
or development order pursuant to Chapter 380, Fla. Statutes. Such facilities shall be
consistent with the capital improvements element of the City Comprehensive Plan. The
agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place
when the impacts of the development occur.
B. Subtracting From That Number the Sum Of
1. The demand for the service or facility created by existing development
as documented in the City Comprehensive Plan; and
2. The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion
of other approved developments, redevelopment, or other development activity.
C. Action upon Failure to Show Available Capacity. Where available capacity
cannot be shown, the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of
service:
1. The project owner or developer may provide the necessary
improvements to maintain level of service. In such case the application shall include
appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are
designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service,
and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction, consistent with calculations
of capacity above.
2. The proposed project may be altered such that projected level of
service is no less than the adopted level of service.
3. Burden of Showing Compliance on Developer. The burden of showing
compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the developer. In
order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient
information showing compliance with these standards.
4. Initial Determination of concurrency. The initial determination of
concurrency occurs during the review of the Preliminary Development Plan,
and shall include compliance with the level of service standards adopted by
the City.
(d) Adopted Levels of Service.
Development activity shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity
to sustain the level of service established in the City Comprehensive Plan which is
hereby adopted by reference. (90-14)
