POLE ATTACHMENT LICENSE AGREEMENT
WITH ________________________________
This Pole Attachment License Agreement (“License Agreement”) is made as of ____________, 20___, (the “Effective Date”) by and between the Village
of Lake Bluff, an Illinois home rule municipal corporation, (the “Village”) and ______________, a __________________ company (the “Licensee”).
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, the Licensee desires to install, operate, and maintain one or more small wireless facilities (“SWFs”) on certain Village-owned utility poles,
wireless support structures, and real property (each a “Village Facility” and collectively “Village Facilities”); and
WHEREAS, the Licensee filed an application for a permit for one or more SWFs the Licensee desires to install on Village Facilities, and the Village has
approved and issued a permit for certain SWFs described in this License Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Licensee may file additional applications for Village approval of SWFs on Village Facilities; and
WHEREAS, the Village and Licensee (collectively the “Parties”) desire to enter into this License Agreement to establish the terms and conditions for
installation, operation, and maintenance on Village Facilities of SWFs for which the Village has issued a permit; and
WHEREAS, the Parties agree that this License Agreement does not provide exclusive use of Village Facilities to the Licensee, and the terms of this
Agreement are nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral, and commercially reasonable;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:
Section 1. Recitals. The foregoing recitals are incorporated in this License Agreement by this reference as substantive provisions of this License
Agreement.
Section 2. Defined Terms. The capitalized terms in this License Agreement that are defined in Section 10 of the Illinois Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act, 50 ILCS 840/1 (the “State Act”) or in Title 7, Chapter 3 of the Lake Bluff Municipal Code (the “Village Code”) have the meanings provided in the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 29/493
include all of the information required by the Application Provisions and the applicable application fee. Renewal of any permits issued will be subject to the
applicable requirements of the State Act, if any.
Section 7. Use of Village Facility. The Licensee’s ability to use a Village Facility is contingent on the Licensee obtaining (A) all certificates, permits,
and other approvals (collectively “Governmental Approvals”) that are required by federal, State of Illinois, and local authorities that will permit the Licensee use of
a Village Facility and (B) a satisfactory structural analysis provided by the Licensee and approved by the Village. If (i) an application for Governmental Approvals
is rejected or a Governmental Approval issued to the Licensee is canceled, expires, lapses, is withdrawn, or is terminated by a governmental authority and (ii) the
Licensee determines that the Governmental Approval may not be obtained in a timely manner, then the Licensee may terminate this License Agreement as to the
proposed Wireless Facility by giving notice to the Village pursuant to Section 19 of this License Agreement. No previously paid Rent (as defined in Section 8) or
rates for that Wireless Facility will be returned to the Licensee.
Section 8. Rent. The Licensee must pay rent to the Village for each SWF at an approved facility location in the amount established in Section 1-12-3
of the Village Code (“Rent”) on an annual basis, in advance, on the day of the year on which installation of the SWF equipment commences (the
“Commencement Date”) and annually thereafter on each anniversary of the Commencement Date; provided, however, that the initial payment of Rent will not be
due until 30 days after the Commencement Date.
Section 9. Operation and Maintenance Standards. Each SWF and Wireless Facility must meet all applicable operation and maintenance standards
under State of Illinois law and Village codes, including, without limitation:
A. Continuing Compliance with Laws. The Licensee must comply at all times with (i) State of Illinois and Village standards applicable to SWFs and
Wireless Facilities and (ii) all Village standards related to construction within public rights-of-way including without limitation wiring, cabling, grounding, utility pole
extensions, and signage, except to the extent preempted by federal or State of Illinois laws or regulations. In the case of a conflict between or among federal
laws and regulations, State of Illinois laws and regulations, and the Village Code or Village ordinances, the federal laws and regulations will apply over State of
Illinois laws and regulations, which will control over the Village Code and Village ordinances.
B. Condition of Wireless Facility; Notice to Village. The Licensee must install, maintain, repair, and modify its Wireless Facility to keep the Wireless
Facility in good and safe condition in compliance with this License Agreement. Prior to undertaking any work on a Wireless Facility other than an emergency
repair, the Licensee must give 48-hours e-mail notice to the Deputy Building Commissioner of the work, including the day, time, and scope of the work.
C. No Interference. The operation of a Wireless Facility must not interfere with the frequencies used by the Village or any public safety agency for
public safety communications. The Licensee must install Wireless Facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with any
public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and
the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC’s”) regulations addressing unacceptable interference with public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency. If a Wireless Facility causes interference, and the Licensee has been given written notice of the interference by the public
safety agency, then the Licensee must take, at its own expense, all reasonable steps necessary to eliminate the interference, including without limitation
powering down the Wireless Facility and later powering up on the Wireless Facility intermittently for testing if necessary. The Village may terminate a license and
permit for a Wireless Facility based on interference if the Licensee at any time fails to make a good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with
the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC.
D. Electricity and Communications Service. The following provisions apply to installation and maintenance of electricity and communications service
to Wireless Facilities.
(i) Installation. The Licensee may install electric and communications services sources to a Wireless Facility according to plans approved by the
Village and in compliance with all applicable Village, State of Illinois, and federal requirements.
(ii) Electrical and Telephone Service. The Licensee may connect its equipment to necessary electrical and telephone service, at the Licensee’s
expense. The Licensee must coordinate with utility companies to provide separate service to the Licensee’s Wireless Facility and notify the Village
if it is unable to do so. If the Licensee can obtain electrical service with a separate meter or another agreement with the utility company, then the
Licensee must pay the utility directly for the Licensee’s power consumption, if the service is billed directly by the utility. If a separate electrical
service is not possible or practical under the circumstances, then the Licensee may use existing service, at the Licensee’s expense, with the
approval of Village, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. If the Licensee uses an existing utility service for a Wireless Facility, then the
Parties either (a) will attempt to have a sub-meter installed at the Licensee’s expense that monitors the Licensee’s utility usage and for which the
Licensee will be provided readings and bills for its usage from the utility company or the Village or (b) will provide for an additional fee for the
Wireless Facility that will cover the Licensee’s utility usage. The Parties agree to reflect power usage and measurement issues in each applicable
Identification Sheet.
(iii) Temporary Power Source. The Licensee, at any time during the Term for a Wireless Facility, may install, maintain, and provide access and a
temporary power source to a Wireless Facility, and all of its related equipment and appurtenances, for up to but not exceeding 48 hours during a
power interruption at the Wireless Facility, in locations approved by Village. The Village will allow the Licensee to connect the temporary power
source to its equipment in areas and a manner approved by Village.

O. Replacement of Pole Before Occupancy. If the Village determines that applicable codes and standards require a utility pole or wireless support
structure to be replaced before a collocation, then the Village’s approval may be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure, at
the Licensee’s cost.
P. Abandonment and Removal. A Wireless Facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months will be considered abandoned and the
Licensee must remove the Wireless Facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from Village notifying the Licensee of the abandonment. The Village will
send the notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested to the last known address of the Licensee. If the Wireless Facility is not removed within
90 days after the notice, then the Village may remove or cause the removal of the Wireless Facility and charge all costs of the removal to the Licensee.
Q. Sale or Transfer. The Licensee must provide written notice to the Village of any intended sale or transfer of a Wireless Facility not less than 30
days prior to that sale or transfer. The notice must include the name and contact information of the wireless provider to which the sale or transfer is proposed.
The Licensee may not sell or transfer a Wireless Facility unless the buyer, transferee, or assignee (i) completes an information sheet to include with the buyer’s
or transferee’s Pole Attachment License Agreement with the Village or (ii) enters into an agreement with the Village for that Wireless Facility.
R. Village Poles Maintenance. The Village will keep its poles in good repair as required by federal, State of Illinois, and local laws. If the Village
does not keep a pole in good repair, then the Licensee may serve notice of disrepair on the Village. If the Village has not restored the pole to good repair within
60 days after notice from the Licensee, or such longer time as the Village requires due to special circumstances and the Village notifies Licensee thereof, then
the Licensee may discontinue paying the annual fee applicable to the affected poles, but only if the pole is no longer capable of being used for the purpose
contemplated in this License Agreement and Licensee is not using the pole. If the Licensee is authorized under this Section to discontinue paying the annual fee,
and the Licensee has prepaid the annual fee for the affected Wireless Facility, then the Licensee may give notice to the Village that the annual fee has been paid
in full and that the Licensee is entitled to credit for the days on which the Wireless Facility was inoperable because of the pole’s disrepair. The Licensee’s notice
must be given within 15 days after the first day the Wireless Facility became inoperable and must include a statement of why the Wireless Facility is inoperable.
If the Licensee discontinues paying the annual fee pursuant to this paragraph, then the Village may terminate this License Agreement as to that Wireless Facility.
The Licensee agrees it has no remedy or recourse for the Village’s failure to comply with this paragraph other than such termination.
S. Make-Ready Work. Make-ready work will be managed in accordance with the standards set forth in Subsection 15(i)(4) of the State Act.
T. Pole Relocation, Removal, Replacement. If the Village reasonably determines to remove, relocate, or replace a pole, then the Village must notify
the Licensee at least 90 days prior to the need to remove or relocate its Wireless Facility. In the event of an imminent threat to property or the health, safety, or
welfare of the public (an “Emergency”), however, the Village will provide as much notice to the Licensee as practical under the circumstances. The Licensee
must remove the affected Wireless Facility from the pole within the 90-day period or immediately in the case of an Emergency. The Licensee must identify
options for an alternative location for the affected Wireless Facility, and the Village will work with the Licensee to identify a mutually agreeable location. The
Licensee will be responsible for all costs related to the removal and relocation of the affected Wireless Facility. If a suitable alternate location cannot be found,
then the Licensee may terminate this License Agreement as to the affected Wireless Facility by giving notice as required by this License Agreement. If the
affected Wireless Facility is relocated, then the Licensee must prepare an Identification Sheet for the alternate location, to be attached to the Schedule of
Approved Wireless Facilities.

additional insured certification and endorsement and provide the additional insured certification and endorsement. The Licensee may self-insure all or a portion
of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by the Village. If the Licensee elects to self-insure, then it must provide the Village evidence sufficient
to demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Village, the Licensee’s or Licensee’s guarantor’s or affiliated parent’s financial ability to self-insure the
coverage and limits required by Village.
Section 11. Indemnification. The Licensee will indemnify and hold harmless the Village against any and all liability and loss from personal injury or
property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of any Village Facility or any Village right-of-way associated with any
Village Facility by the Licensee or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this License Agreement and the
State Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Licensee has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or
caused solely by the negligence of the Village or its employees or agents. In addition, the Licensee hereby waives any claims for consequential, incidental, or
special damages, however caused, based on any theory of liability, that the Licensee may have against the Village relating to this License Agreement or the
Wireless Facilities.

due and not timely paid or remitted. Late filing and payment penalties shall not apply to a particular taxpayer if, but only if, a failure to file penalty is

filing or late payment was due to a reasonable cause and abate some or all the penalty.

addition, shall be liable in a civil action for the full amount of the tax due, plus the applicable amount of interest. (Ord. 2000-18, 12-11-2000, eff. 1-1-

the permittee will be required to notify such person the morning of the burn, before commencement of the burn activity, provided the person is at home.
Based on the information specified in the permit application and any information provided by residents adjoining the property for which the permit is
sought, the fire chief may require that notice, as specified above, be provided to additional residents as the department deems appropriate. Those
additional residents requiring notification will be listed on the permit when issued or added by modification to an issued permit should they become
known after issuance of the permit. The fire chief will take any comments by neighboring residents into account when determining whether the open
burning permit should issue.

Chapter 5
SMOKING REGULATIONS
4-5-1: INTRODUCTION:
Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such smoke as well as the potential damage to property which
may result from the combustible nature of such substance. It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and
nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide,
nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68 percent of the smoke produced by a cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with
respiratory tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
The use of e-cigarettes, as an alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes, has proliferated in recent years. Although often marketed as safe, the United
States food and drug administration has issued a caution related to e-cigarettes because the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes have not been fully
researched and studied, and it is not known if the use of e-cigarettes may lead young people to try tobacco products, including conventional cigarettes,
which are known to cause disease and lead to premature death.
Because the hazards of smoking and the use of e-cigarettes have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare,
comfort and property of residents of the village, it is, therefore, necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit smoking and the use of ecigarettes
in all enclosed public places, in all places of employment, and in certain unenclosed public places. (Ord. 2015-15, 9-28-2015)
4-5-2: TITLE; PURPOSE:
This chapter may be cited as the LAKE BLUFF SMOKING BAN ORDINANCE, the purpose of which is to protect the public health, comfort and
environment by prohibiting smoking and the use of e-cigarettes in all enclosed public places, all places of employment, and in certain unenclosed public
areas, in order to ensure that nonsmokers may breathe air free from the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke. (Ord. 2015-15, 9-28-2015)

way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
b. In the event that the deputy building commissioner fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: 1)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new

construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
c. Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a permit is required for work pursuant to this section, the telecommunications retailer
shall submit to the village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available regarding the facility to be
constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection D1 of this section.

issued authorization under the cable and video competition law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days after submission to the village,
unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and regulations. (Ord. 2009-
3, 2-9-2009)
E. Effect Of Permit:
1. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights of way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
2. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and
is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
3. Unless waived in writing by the deputy building commissioner, no construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to
attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting.
The preconstruction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as the
village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations,
procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property
owners.
4. The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and applicable statutes,
laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
F. Revised Permit Drawings: In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans,
drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 7-3-15 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

alleged to arise out of or result from, the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives.
C. Security:
1. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this subsection. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this subsection at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized
under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
a. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
b. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
c. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by the permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
2. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
subsection C2 shall, at a minimum:
a. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
b. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered thereby; and
c. Provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
3. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least
as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the deputy building commissioner, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the deputy building commissioner may, in the exercise of sound discretion,
allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection
C3 for any single phase.
4. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice, clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection C4, may withdraw an amount from the security fund; provided, that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such
amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
a. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
b. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
c. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
d. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
5. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C3 of this section.
6. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village; provided, that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection C3 of this section.

7. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the
security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the
permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any
reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation; provided, that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or
damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
8. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether

than 1 part per million chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the village as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the village prior to the time of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to
the discharger and administered under the authority of the United States environmental protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and all other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval
has been granted by the village for the discharge to the stormwater drainage system.
c. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or
practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this subsection if the person connects a line
conveying sewage or any other nonstormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
7. Suspension Of MS4 Access:
a. Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
b. Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this subsection may have their MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing.
c. Violation: A person violates this subsection B7 if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this subsection without the
prior written approval of the village.
8. Industrial Or Construction Activity Discharges: Any person subject to an NPDES construction site activities permit or NPDES industrial activities
permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Said person shall submit to the village a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) that was provided to
the Illinois environmental protection agency (IEPA). Additional proof of compliance with an NPDES construction site activities permit or NPDES
industrial activities permit may be required, in a form acceptable to the village, prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
9. Monitoring Of Discharges:
a. The village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this subsection as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this subsection. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the village.
b. Facility operators shall allow the village ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, copying of
records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal
law.
c. The village shall have the right to set up on any premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the village to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
d. The village has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
e. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the village and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
f. Unreasonable delays in allowing the village access to a premises is a violation of this subsection. A person who is the operator of a facility with an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation of this subsection if the person denies the village
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this subsection.
g. If the village has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subsection, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subsection or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the village may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
10. Requirement To Prevent, Control, And Reduce Stormwater Pollutants By The Use Of Best Management Practices: The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the municipal stormwater drainage system or waters of the United States through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at
said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm
sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
11. Watercourse Protection: Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that
part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
12. Notification Of Spills: Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or any person
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or
may result in illegal discharges or pollutants entering stormwater, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the United States, said person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials,
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the village in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the village within three (3) business days of the phone call or
personal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least three (3) years.
13. Notice Of Violation:
a. Whenever the village finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this subsection, the village may order
compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;

restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline,
the work may be performed by the village and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
14. Appeal Of Notice Of Violation: Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the village. The notice of appeal must be
received within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the village administrator, shall take place within
thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the village administrator shall be final.
15. Enforcement: If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal,
within thirty (30) days of the decision of the village administrator, then the village reserves the right to enter upon the subject private property and to
take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in
possession of any premises to refuse to allow the village or its designee to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. The village may
extend the period for corrective action upon a showing of good cause for extension of the corrective action period.
16. Cost Of Abatement Of The Violation: Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation by the village, the owner of the property will be notified
of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment
within fifteen (15) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the village or by the expiration of the
time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the
amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable to the village by reason of such violation.
The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal monthly payments. Interest at the rate of prime plus two percent (2%) per annum shall
be assessed on the balance beginning on the first day following discovery of the violation.
17. Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this subsection. If a
person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this subsection, the village may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.

qualified person making the application, stating that the proposed work is authorized by the owner in fee and that the applicant is authorized to make
such application. The full names and addresses of the owner, lessee, and applicant and of the responsible officers, if the owner or lessee is a corporate

(1) For buildings or structures first constructed after 1978, a visual inspection report from a properly licensed remediation contractor stating that
after a visual inspection, the contractor knows of no hazardous construction materials used in the building or structure to be demolished.
(2) For buildings or structures first constructed in or before 1978, or if the visual inspection report required pursuant to subsection H2c(1) of this
section reveals that hazardous construction materials exist in the building or structure to be demolished, a report from a properly licensed
remediation contractor stating that, based on an actual sampling of the construction materials where hazardous construction materials are likely
to exist, that no such hazardous construction materials were found.

order to enforce Village codes or ordinances or to protect public safety, health, or welfare.
B. Issuance And Effect Of Stop Work Order: The Building Commissioner, or his or her authorized designee, may issue a stop work order either orally or in
writing. If the stop work order is first issued orally, then it must be followed with a written stop work order within forty eight (48) hours after such oral
order. After a stop work order has been issued, whether orally or in writing, all work or action subject to such order must be stopped immediately. The
stop work order may be given to the permittee, to his or her agent, or to the person doing the work. A copy of the stop work order will be posted on the
premises.
C. Unlawful Continuance: It is unlawful for any person to do any work or to take any action in violation of a stop work order. Any person, other than the
Building Commissioner or his or her authorized designee, who removes a posted stop work order or who continues any work in or about the building,
structure, or premises after a stop work order has been issued and posted, is guilty of a violation of this section and is subject to prosecution and fines
as provided in this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the permittee, after approval of the Building Commissioner, may do such
work as is necessary to protect the public health and safety and to correct the safety hazards, Code violations, or other defects complained of in the
stop work order. The Building Commissioner will set forth the conditions under which such approval will be given to proceed.
D. Removal Of Stop Work Order: A stop work order may be removed only when the Building Commissioner is satisfied that the safety hazards have been
rectified, that the violations have been corrected, that the proper building permits have been issued, that such other action has been taken or is
forthcoming to resolve the original complaints, and that proper cash bonds or other guarantees have been filed with the Village. After payment of the
required fee, as provided in section 1-12-3 of this Code, written release of the stop work order will be given to all parties who had previously received
the original stop work order. The stop work order then will be removed by the Building Commissioner and the work may proceed. (Ord. 2013-4, 2-25-

changed, may be used or occupied in such part until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued by the Building Commissioner certifying that
the work has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the approved permit or that the use is properly authorized by, and in compliance
with, applicable law. In the case of a change of ownership without work requiring a permit; a new certificate of occupancy is required.
C. Temporary Certificate Of Occupancy:
1. General: When a building or project has been completed but, for good cause, minor building and site improvements that are affected by weather

issue a temporary certificate of occupancy, but only after a request therefor, payment of the required fee, and posting of the required bond. No
temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued except after a finding by the Building Commissioner that such permit will not adversely affect the

the building commissioner determines that such work will pose no immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of workers or of the general
public. No such temporary occupancy permit creates or gives rise to, or may be construed or applied to create or give rise to, any right in the
permittee to further occupy the structure. Every such permit must state that it does not create any right to a final occupancy permit and that all work
undertaken pursuant to such permit is at the permittee's sole risk. No use or occupation for conducting business is permitted except after issuance of
such a temporary occupancy permit.

or his designee to place inventory, fixtures, racking, material, stock, other types of inventory, or the like in a business, office, or industrial building. This
permission may be granted only if the placement of the materials will not limit the completion of construction or inspections and provided the fire
suppression and alarm systems have been installed, tested, and accepted by the village fire department for granting of such permission. This
permission does not allow occupation of the building or area to conduct business of any kind under any circumstances. (Ord. 2013-4, 2-25-2013)

declare, to the building commissioner, his or her acceptance or rejection of the terms of the notice.
D. Restoration Of Unsafe Structure: An unsafe structure may be restored to a safe condition. If the cost of the repairs or reconstruction necessary to put
the structure into a safe condition is estimated by the building commissioner to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the structure in its
unrestored condition, then the structure must be made to comply in all respects with the provisions of this title, the Lake Bluff zoning regulations, and all
other applicable codes and ordinances for the construction of a new structure, including, without limitation, the installation of fire and life safety systems
required pursuant to this title.

cause to be posted, at each entrance to such structure, a notice reading "DANGER" and stating that the structure is unsafe and its use or occupancy
has been prohibited. It is unlawful thereafter for any person to enter such structure except for the purpose of making required repairs or demolishing the
structure.

A. Authority Of The Building Commissioner: The building commissioner may render interpretations of the provisions of this title and of any rule, regulation,
or condition issued or imposed pursuant to it.
B. Purpose Of Interpretations: The interpretation authority established by this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this title cannot

interpretation of the specific provisions of this title in light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because
the interpretation authority herein established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or to change the
essential content of this title, but rather is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
C. Procedure: Any person who seeks an interpretation must file a written application therefor with the village's building department stating specifically the
title provisions at issue and the facts and circumstances related to such person's request for an interpretation. The building commissioner will make a
decision in writing on such interpretation and provide that written decision to the applicant within thirty (30) days after the application is filed. Any failure
of the building commissioner to act within thirty (30) days, or within such further time to which the applicant may agree, will be deemed to be a decision
denying the application rendered on the day immediately after that thirty (30) day period.
D. Appeals:
1. Right To Appeal: A decision by the building commissioner on an interpretation under this section, or on the application of a provision of this title, may
be appealed to the architectural board of review by the filing of a written application for an appeal with the village administrator.

b. Meetings must be open to the public. There is no requirement that members of the public be allowed to speak at a meeting.
c. The appellant, the appellant's representative, the village, and any person whose interests are directly affected must be given an opportunity to be
heard and may submit documents in support of their position.
d. At a meeting, the architectural board of review may receive testimony and review documents and other relevant materials.
e. The building commissioner may participate fully in all proceedings, but has no vote on any decision.
5. Decisions: The architectural board of review must issue a written decision within fifteen (15) days after the conclusion of the meeting on appeal. That
decision must be transmitted promptly to the appellant. A failure of the architectural board of review to issue a written decision within fifteen (15) days
will be deemed a denial of the appeal. All decisions by the architectural board of reviews are final. (Ord. 2013-4, 2-25-2013)

B. Procedure:
1. Initiation: Within five (5) days after the filing of any Demolition LOI, as defined in subsection 9-1-18H2 of this title or permit application for the
alteration, demolition, or any other physical modifications of a landmark (the "proposed work"), the Building Commissioner shall advise the applicant
of the required advisory review and shall forward a copy of such Demolition LOI or application, together with plans pertaining thereto, if any, to the
commission. In the event that a property owner had previously submitted a Demolition LOI to the Village in accordance with subsection 9-1-18H2 of
this title, the Demolition LOI shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of this subsection unless and until the property owner resubmits such
Demolition LOI or a new Demolition LOI to the Village.
2. Advisory Review Conference: Upon receipt of a Demolition LOI or an application from the Building Commissioner, the commission shall consider the
extent to which the proposed work may be consistent or inconsistent with the purpose and goals of this chapter and the criteria described in
subsection C of this section. If the commission determines that the proposed work is inconsistent with the purpose and goals of this chapter, the
commission shall request a conference with the permit applicant. The commission shall transmit its concerns and recommendations to the permit
applicant at the time such request is made, and the commission and the permit applicant shall use such conference to reach a mutually satisfactory
resolution of the commission's concerns. If the commission determines, either with or without a conference, that the proposed work will not be
inconsistent with the purpose and goals of this chapter, the commission shall inform the Building Commissioner of such determination, and the
application shall be evaluated strictly on its merits under all other Village Building Codes and regulations.
3. Time For Review: Except as provided in subsection B4 of this section, no sooner than one hundred twenty (120) days after filing a Demolition LOI for
a landmark, and no sooner than thirty five (35) days after filing an application for a permit to undertake any other alteration, or other physical
modifications to a landmark, a permit applicant may notify the commission and Building Commissioner in writing that it no longer intends to
participate in the advisory review process; provided, that the permit applicant has attended an advisory review conference with the commission
during that one hundred twenty (120) day period. Upon receipt of such notice, and notwithstanding any determination of the commission, the Building
Commissioner shall evaluate the application strictly on its merits under all other Village Building Codes and regulations.
4. Extension Of Time For Advisory Review:
a. If a permit applicant is unable to attend or fails to attend an advisory review conference, the advisory review period will be extended for such time
as is necessary for the permit applicant to schedule and attend an advisory review conference with the commission or its designated
representatives.
b. In addition to any other extension, upon request of the commission and written notice to the permit applicant, the Village Board may consider and
grant an extension, not exceeding an additional thirty (30) days, of the time for an advisory review of an application for alteration, demolition, or
any other physical modifications of a landmark, if the Board determines that the commission's efforts to preserve a landmark will promote the
public welfare without causing undue hardship on the permit applicant.
5. Other Laws And Regulations: Except to the extent specifically and clearly in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the advisory review process
shall not negate, modify, or supersede any other Village Building Codes and regulations or other applicable law.
6. Posting Of Signage: Within five (5) days of the commission's request for an advisory review conference regarding the proposed work for a landmark,
the Building Commissioner shall cause signage to be posted at the landmark or historic structure including the following information: a) that the
Village has received a permit application for the proposed work; b) that the commission is conducting an advisory review conference regarding the
proposed work; and c) the date, time and location of the meeting(s) of the commission during the advisory review period. (Ord. 2019-1, 1-14-2019)
C. Criteria: In conducting an advisory review, the commission shall consider and urge the applicant to incorporate into the proposed work the following
criteria:
1. General Standards:
a. Reasonable efforts should be made to use property for its originally intended purpose or to provide a compatible use that requires minimal
alteration of a structure, building, site, or landscape and its environment.
b. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure, building, site, or landscape and its environment should not be destroyed. No
alteration or demolition of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should be permitted except when necessary to assure an
economically viable use of a site.
c. All structures, buildings, sites, and landscapes should be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and that
seek to create an earlier appearance than the true age of the property are discouraged.
d. Changes that may have taken place over time evidence the history and development of a structure, building, site, or landscape and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance should be recognized and respected when
dealing with a specific architectural period.
e. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a structure, building, site, or landscape should be maintained
and preserved if possible.
f. Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced, if possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
g. Surface and other forms of cleaning of structures, buildings, sites, and landscapes should be undertaken with the gentlest means possible.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the structures, buildings, sites, or landscapes should be avoided.
h. New structures and buildings, and alterations to sites and landscapes, should not be discouraged when such structures or alterations do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural features and are compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the site,
neighborhood, or environment.
i. If possible, new structures and buildings, and alterations to the existing conditions of sites and landscapes, should be undertaken in such a manner
that, if such new structures or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure, building, site, or
landscape would be unimpaired.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 294/493
j. Alterations that do not affect any essential architectural or historic features of a structure, building, site, or landscape, as viewed from the public
way, ordinarily should be permitted.
k. Any permitted alteration or demolition should promote the purposes of this chapter and the general welfare of the village and its residents.
l. Demolition should not be undertaken if a structure, building, site, or landscape is economically viable in its present condition or could be
economically viable after completion of appropriate alterations, even if demolition would permit a more profitable use of such site.
2. Design Guidelines:
a. The height of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the height of the original landmark.
b. The relationship between a landmark and adjacent open spaces after its alteration should be compatible with such relationship prior to such
alteration.
c. The relationship among the height, width, and scale of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with such relationship prior to such
alteration.
d. The directional expression of a landmark after alteration, whether its vertical or horizontal positioning, should be compatible with the directional
expression of the original landmark.
e. The roof shape of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the roof shape of the original landmark.
f. The architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and colors of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the architectural
details, general design, materials, textures, and colors of the original landmark.
g. The appurtenances, including, without limitation, signs, fences, landscaping, accessory structures, and pavings, of a landmark after alteration
should be compatible with the appurtenances of the original landmark.
h. In addition to the foregoing guidelines, the commission may consider the secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation guidelines for
rehabilitating historic buildings (revised 1983), and any amendments thereto, in conducting an advisory review. (Ord. 2008-20, 7-14-2008)
9-14-7: CERTIFICATION OF LANDMARKS:
A. Eligibility: Every landmark shall be eligible for certification.
B. Procedures: The legal and if applicable, the beneficial owner or owners of a landmark may submit to the board of trustees a declaration setting forth, at

an agreement to be subject to and bound by the provisions of section 9-14-8 of this chapter regarding certificates of appropriateness. Any declaration
in a form and of substance acceptable to the board of trustees shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds. Upon recordation of the
declaration and delivery of a copy of such recorded declaration to the commission, such landmark shall become certified.
C. Withdrawal Of Certification: After a landmark has become certified, the certification shall not be withdrawn except by an express determination set forth
in an ordinance or resolution of the board of trustees. In addition, upon the withdrawal of landmark designation pursuant to section 9-14-5 of this
chapter, certification of such landmark shall also be withdrawn. (Ord. 2008-20, 7-14-2008)

(10) days after the first regularly scheduled meeting of the PCZBA after the close of said public hearing, whichever is later, the PCZBA shall render
its final decision or make its recommendation, as the case may be, on the requested variation. The failure of the PCZBA to act within said thirty five
(35) day period, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision to deny the variation in accordance with
subsection A1 of this section or to recommend that the variation be denied in accordance with subsection A2 of this section.
5. No Variations From Chapter 11 Of This Title: Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, under no circumstances shall a variation be
recommended or granted pursuant to this section to allow relief from the strict application of any of the provisions of chapter 11 of this title.
B. Standards For Variations: Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no variation shall be granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant
shall have established that carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this title would create a particular hardship or a practical difficulty. Such a
showing shall require proof that the variation being sought satisfies each of the following standards:
1. Unique Physical Condition: The subject property or structure is exceptional as compared to other lots and structures subject to the same provision by
reason of a unique physical condition, including: a) presence of an existing use, structure, or sign, whether conforming or nonconforming; b) irregular
or substandard shape or size; c) exceptional topographical features; or d) other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the
subject property or structure that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot or structure rather
than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot or structure.
2. Not Merely Special Privilege: The alleged hardship or difficulty is not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special privilege or
additional right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely an inability to make more money from the
sale of the subject property; provided, however, that where the standards herein set out exist, the existence of an economic hardship shall not be a
prerequisite to the granting of an authorized variation.
3. Code Purposes: The variation would not result in a use or development of the subject property that would not be in harmony with the general and
specific purposes for which this code and the provision from which a variation is sought were enacted.
4. Public Health And Safety: The variation would not: a) impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property; b) increase the congestion in
public streets unreasonably, or increase parking requirements on public streets unreasonably; c) increase the hazard of fire; d) endanger the public
safety; e) diminish or impair the value of property within the area surrounding the subject property; or f) in any other respect impair the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, and welfare.
C. Conditions On Variations: The PCZBA or the village board, whichever body has the final authority to grant the variation pursuant to subsection A of this
section, may impose, and the PCZBA, if it is a recommending body pursuant to subsection A2 of this section, may recommend the imposition of such
specific conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this title upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon
other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the resolution or ordinance granting the variation. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the variation.
D. Procedure: Any person or entity seeking a variation shall pay the applicable zoning application fee as required pursuant to section 10-2-6 of this chapter
and shall file a completed application for the requested variation with the village on a form prescribed by the village. The applicant shall also provide the
village with such additional information and material as the village may require. After receipt of the required fee and application and any additional
information requested by the village, the PCZBA shall consider the applicant's requested variation at a public hearing, fifteen (15) days' notice of which
shall have been given as prescribed by the Illinois municipal code. Every variation, whether made final by the PCZBA pursuant to subsection A1 of this
section or by the village board of trustees pursuant to subsection A2 of this section, shall be accompanied by findings of fact and shall refer to any
exhibits containing plans and specifications for the proposed variation, which exhibits shall remain part of the permanent records of the village.
E. Authority To Seek Variations: Applications for variations may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject
property.
F. Limitations On Variations:
1. Time Period: Subject to an extension of time granted by the village administrator pursuant to subsection F2 of this section or by the board of trustees
by resolution duly adopted, no variation from the provisions of this title shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless: a) a building permit is
issued and the construction for which the variation is granted is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion; or
b) a certificate of occupancy is issued and the use for which the variation is granted is commenced within that period.
2. Time Extension: Unless the board of trustees, by a duly adopted ordinance or resolution, shall expressly provide otherwise, the village administrator
may, upon written request, for good cause shown and without any notice or hearing, extend the time limit imposed by subsection F1 of this section
for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months if the village administrator determines that such an extension is appropriate and necessary to avoid
undue hardship. All such written requests shall be submitted to the village administrator prior to the expiration of the time limit for which an extension
is sought. The village administrator shall inform the village board of all extensions granted pursuant to this subsection F2. (Ord. 95-21, 7-11-1995;
amd. Ord. 97-15, 6-12-1997; Ord. 99-28, 9-13-1999; Ord. 2000-11, 7-10-2000; Ord. 2010-10, 5-24-2010; Ord. 2011-17, 9-26-2011; Ord. 2012-10, 4-

processed pursuant to this chapter.
1. Responsibility For Payment: The owner of the property that is the subject of the petition and, if different, the petitioner shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of the cost recovery fee and for the cost recovery lien. By signing the petition, the owner or petitioner shall be deemed to have

account.
b. Draws From Escrow: From the date of filing of any petition, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the actual costs of processing and
reviewing the petition. The village shall, from time to time, draw funds from the escrow account established to pay costs identified in subsection C2

c. Additional Deposits: Should the village at any time determine that the escrow account established in connection with any petition is, or is likely to
become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of processing a petition, the village shall inform the applicant of that fact in writing and demand an
additional deposit in an amount deemed to be sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and until such additional amount is deposited
by the applicant, the village may direct that processing of the petition be suspended or terminated. Any termination shall be deemed a withdrawal
of the petition by the applicant.

forth in this section. The board of appeals is hereby designated as the commission to publish or post the legal notices of, and to conduct the public
hearings on proposed amendments and to make reports and recommendations to the village board.
B. Purpose: The amendment process established by this section is intended to provide a means for making changes in the text of the regulations of this
title and the districts established in this title and set forth on the village zoning map that have more or less general significance or application. It is not
intended to relieve particular hardships nor to confer special privileges or rights. Rather, it is intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of these
regulations and the village zoning map in light of changing, newly discovered, or newly important conditions, situations, or knowledge.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Amendments: An application for a map or text amendment may be filed by the board of trustees, the PCZBA, the owner of, or
any person having a contractual interest in, any property to be affected by a proposed map amendment, or any person interested in a proposed
amendment to the text of the regulations of this title.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: Any applicant (other than the board of trustees or PCZBA) seeking an amendment shall pay the applicable zoning application fee as
required pursuant to section 10-2-6 of this chapter and shall file a completed application for the requested amendment with the village on a form

consideration of the proposed amendment. To approve the proposed amendment, with or without modifications, the board must duly adopt an
ordinance; provided, however, that in the event a duly signed and acknowledged protest against a proposed amendment is filed with the village clerk
before the adoption of such amendment by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage to be affected by the proposed amendment,
or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage immediately adjoining or across therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be affected, the proposed amendment shall not be passed except by a favorable vote
of two-thirds (2/3) of all the trustees then holding office.
5. Standard For Amendments:
a. General Standards For All Amendments: The wisdom of amending the village zoning map or the text of this title is a matter committed to the
sound legislative discretion of the board of trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. In determining whether a proposed amendment will be
granted or denied the board of trustees may be guided by the principle that its power to amend this title should be exercised in the public good. In
considering whether that principle is satisfied in any particular case, the board of trustees may weigh, among other factors, the following factors:
(1) The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this title;
(2) The community need for the proposed amendment and any uses or development it would allow;
(3) The conformity of the proposed amendment with the village's comprehensive plan and zoning map, or the reasons justifying its lack of
conformity.
b. Additional Standards For Map Amendments: For an amendment to the zoning map, the board of trustees may weigh the following additional
factors concerning the subject property:
(1) The existing uses and zoning of properties in the vicinity;
(2) Development trends in the vicinity;
(3) The impact of the property's existing zoning on:
(A) Its value; and
(B) The public health, safety and welfare;
(4) The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted under its current zoning, including the availability of adequate utilities and essential
public services;
(5) The impact of the proposed amendment on:
(A) The use, enjoyment, value, and future orderly development of adjacent properties;
(B) Traffic in the immediate vicinity; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

(6) The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been vacant, considered in the context of the pace of development in the vicinity of the
subject property. (Ord. 2010-10, 5-24-2010; amd. Ord. 2012-10, 4-9-2012, eff. 5-1-2012)

Personal wireless services antennas and facilities.
(1) Statement Of Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to provide specific regulations and standards for the placement and siting of
personal wireless services antennas and related facilities that are meant to provide personal wireless services in the village. The goal of this
subsection is to provide regulations that will facilitate the location of various types of personal wireless services antennas and facilities in
permitted locations so that they are consistent with the character of the village. The sizable areas of open space, the extensive natural
landscaping, and the relatively low scale of structures in the village all contribute to this unique and distinctive setting. Minimizing the adverse
visual impact of personal wireless services antennas and facilities within the village, and especially within the residential core of the village, is
one of the primary objectives of this section, and the village encourages providers of personal wireless services to be creative in designing
personal wireless services antennas and facilities that minimally impact the unique and distinctive character of the village. This subsection is
intended to allow personal wireless services antennas and facilities that are sufficient to allow adequate personal wireless services to citizens,
the traveling public, and others within the village, while maintaining the unique character of the village as described in the comprehensive
plan.
(2) Separation From Residential Districts And Properties: Personal wireless services antennas, antennas support structures, and personal
wireless services facilities shall not be located within five hundred feet (500') from the nearest outside wall of any single-family dwelling in
existence prior to the commencement of construction of such personal wireless services antennas, antenna support structures, or personal
wireless services facilities; provided, however, that the personal wireless services antennas, antenna support structures, or personal wireless
services facilities that are located on property owned by the village may be located within five hundred feet (500'), but not less than one
hundred fifty feet (150'), from the nearest outside wall of any single-family dwelling.

than an existing structure that is designed primarily for a purpose other than supporting a personal wireless services antenna, shall:
(A) Be constructed at the minimum height required to adequately serve the antennas placed thereon;
(B) Be a monopole, unless otherwise authorized by the board of trustees for good cause shown;
(C) Not be illuminated or have any signs installed thereon (other than private warning signs) unless otherwise required by federal law or
regulations or authorized by the board of trustees;
(D) Be separated from any building on an adjoining lot by a distance that is not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the height of the
antenna support structure and be designed to withstand a wind force of one hundred twenty (120) miles per hour without the use of
supporting guywires. For the purposes of this requirement, this distance shall be measured horizontally from the center of the base of the
antenna support structure to the point where the ground meets a vertical wall of such building; and
(E) Be adequately screened from view by the natural tree landscaping or otherwise designed in such a manner that the antenna support
structure itself is minimally intrusive to the visual landscape.
(4) Location:
(A) Unavailability Of Village Sites: No personal wireless services antenna or antenna support structure shall be permitted on any lot that is not
owned or occupied by the village unless the applicant is able to demonstrate that no village owned or occupied property is available, on
commercially reasonable terms, and sufficient for the location of an antenna necessary for the provision of personal wireless services.
(B) Existing Structures: Personal wireless services antennas shall be mounted on existing antenna support structures or other lawfully existing
buildings, unless otherwise provided in this section. No more than one antenna support structure shall be permitted on any one zoning lot.
(5) Collocation: Unless otherwise authorized by the board of trustees for good cause shown, every newly constructed antenna support structure
for the provision of personal wireless services shall be designed, constructed and installed to be of a sufficient size and capacity to allow the
commercially feasible location of personal wireless services antennas for additional providers of personal wireless services on such structure
in the future. Any permit for such an antenna support structure may be conditioned on the agreement of the applicant to allow collocation of
another provider of personal wireless services on commercially reasonable terms specified in such permit.

accordance with subsection J6 of this section. Failure of the PCZBA to submit its recommendation to the village board within sixty (60) days of the
close of the public hearing shall be deemed to be a recommendation of approval, unless the delay is at the request of the applicant.
6. Considerations: In making a determination regarding the reasonableness of a requested accommodation, the following factors shall be considered:
a. Whether the housing which is the subject of the request will be used by an individual or a group of individuals considered disabled or handicapped
under the act;

portion of such structure that extends three feet (3') or more from the preexisting or proposed grade, whichever grade is more restrictive, to the
finished first floor elevation (see section 10-13-1 of this title, illustration 19).
(2) For a basement, crawl space, or subterranean garage constructed before January 1, 1950, the total area, in square feet, of all of that portion of
such structure that extends five feet (5') or more from the preexisting or proposed grade, whichever grade is more restrictive, to the finished first
floor elevation (see section 10-13-1 of this title, illustration 20). If, however, the principal structure is structurally altered, enlarged, or replaced to
the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the principal structure existing at the time of such alteration, enlargement, or
replacement, the special gross floor area exception contained in this subsection B1a(2) shall no longer apply.
b. Expanded Window Well: The total area, in square feet of the expanded window well, calculated by taking the ratio of the length of the exposed
basement wall within the window well that is three feet (3') or more in height (measured from the bottom of the well to the finished first floor
elevation) to the total perimeter of the foundation of the structure, and multiplying that result by the total floor area of the basement and/or crawl
space (see section 10-13-1 of this title, illustration 20).
c. Walkout Basement Stairwell: The total area, in square feet, of the walkout basement stairwell, calculated by taking the ratio of the length of the
exposed basement wall within the basement stairwell that is three feet (3') or more in height (measured down from the first floor elevation) to the
total perimeter of the foundation of the structure, and multiplying that result by the total floor area of the basement and/or crawl space (see section

10-5J-1: PURPOSE:
The intent of this article is:
A. To preserve the natural scenic qualities of open spaces;
B. To provide a harmonious variety of architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within the development;
C. To permit creative and imaginative design not always possible under conventional zoning regulations; and
D. In general, to permit greater flexibility and facilitate the use of techniques of large area land development which will be most advantageous to the
village. (Ord. 87-38, 12-14-1987)
10-5J-2: PERMITTED USES:
Uses permitted in a planned residential development may include, and shall be limited to, single-family dwellings and multiple-family dwellings and lawful
accessory structures incidental thereto, buildings primarily devoted to religious worship, private elementary or high schools without dormitory
accommodations, and buildings, structures or other facilities for common recreational use, provided such structures shall be in compliance with the
standards and regulations set forth in this article and in compliance with all other applicable ordinances and acts of the village and the statutes and
regulations of other governmental units having jurisdiction. Other uses which shall have been permitted in the zoning district or districts in which the
proposed development is located prior to approval of the planned residential development pursuant to this article shall be superseded and not permitted in
the development area, after such approval. (Ord. 87-38, 12-14-1987)
10-5J-3: STANDARDS:
A planned residential development must meet the following standards:
A. Ownership: The site must be under common ownership prior to final approval of a planned residential development. Applications for a planned
residential development must be filed by and executed by all parties in interest as landowners, owners, beneficiaries, trustees, mortgagees or
otherwise. Until approval of a final plat for a planned residential development, applications therefor must be amended to reflect all changes in
ownership. The names of all beneficial owners, shareholders and the like must be disclosed in all instances where such party has more than a five
percent (5%) interest in an entity that is an applicant for the planned residential development.
B. Minimum Size: The site must be not less than six (6) acres; provided, however, that the board of trustees may approve a site of less than six (6) acres if,
after public hearings, the board shall find that a planned residential development on such site is in the public interest and that one or more of the
following conditions exist:
1. Because of unusual physical features of the property itself or of the neighborhood in which it is located, a deviation from the regulations otherwise
applicable is necessary or appropriate in order to conserve a physical or topographic feature of importance to the village.
2. The property of its neighborhood has a historic character or economic importance to the community that will be protected by use of a planned
residential development.
3. The property is adjacent to or across the street from property which has been developed or redeveloped under a planned residential development,
and a planned residential development will contribute to the maintenance of the amenities and values of the neighboring property.
C. Zoning: The site must be zoned consistent with the proposed development and must not require any rezoning for consideration of the application;
provided, however, that the village board of trustees may permit or direct the consideration of any planned residential development by the PCZBA in
conjunction with any request for rezoning by the petitioner.
D. Density:
1. The cumulative total number of dwelling units within the development, for all phases of construction, shall not exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units determined at the applicable rate as set forth in the following table for the zoning district classifications which were in effect for the
various parts of the subject area immediately prior to the filing of the plan:

E-2 100
R-1 193
R-2 289
R-3 363
2. If the proposed development is located in more than one zoning district, the rate of dwelling units shall be calculated separately for the area in each
district without rounding off, and then totaled. Remaining fractional units, if any, shall be rounded off to the nearest whole number of units, with onehalf
(1/2) or more raised to the next higher whole number and less than one-half (1/2) units reduced to the next lower whole number. No more than
four (4) dwelling units shall be under one roof or otherwise attached.
E. Ground Coverage: The total ground area occupied by buildings and structures shall not exceed thirty percent (30%). If the village board shall determine,
upon a showing by the landowner that a greater percentage of ground coverage will not have an undue adverse impact on existing public facilities or
on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property, and that an increase in the ground coverage is appropriate because of unique physical
characteristics of the site, the board may permit an increase of the total ground coverage from said thirty percent (30%) to a total ground coverage of
thirty three percent (33%).
F. Building Height: The maximum height of buildings shall be thirty four feet (34') and shall not exceed two and one-half (21/2) stories.
G. Parking: Two (2) off street automobile parking spaces, at least one of which is enclosed, shall be provided for each dwelling unit, and all other parking
requirements for residential uses provided in other sections of this title shall be met.

10-6A-11: DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES:
A. Purpose: Due to its modest scale, the CBD exhibits an intimacy within the village that is unique among suburban business districts. This extraordinary
feature should not be sacrificed as part of revitalization, redevelopment, or remodeling involving new construction or exterior modifications. Rather, the
maintenance of this intimacy is the key purpose and goal underlying the design guidelines set forth in subsection B of this section.
B. Design Guidelines: The following design guidelines are for use in reviewing site design, building architecture, and related streetscape construction
within the CBD. These guidelines are designed to encourage revitalization and creativity consistent with the scale and style of the CBD. The guidelines
are intended to provide direction to the private developers as well as to the architectural board of review, PCZBA, and the village board of trustees
whenever engaged in the process of design review for new construction or exterior remodeling in the CBD. Specifically, but without limitation, these
guidelines shall be used: 1) to determine whether a proposed variation meets the standards set forth in subsection 10-2-4B of this title; and 2) to
determine whether to grant or deny site plan approval within the CBD pursuant to section 10-2-8 of this title.
1. Generally: The design concept for the CBD is an early twentieth century small town district focused on a "main street", a village green, and a
commuter railroad station. Existing buildings and other key physical features of architectural or historic merit should be preserved to the extent
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 351/493
feasible and should be the standard against which all new development and exterior modifications are measured. It is essential that the CBD exhibit
a pedestrian friendly ambiance throughout.
2. Organization And Design: The organization and design of the major elements of the buildings and structures in the CBD should reflect the
characteristic rhythm and scale of adjacent and surrounding buildings and structures in order to create a pleasing, composite appearance for the
entire CBD.
3. Elevations: All building elevations visible from other private property or from a public street or open space should be designed in harmony with such
other property, streets, and open space.
4. Architectural Style: A variety of alternative, yet compatible, architectural styles is acceptable. However, new commercial buildings should be
consistent with established styles.
5. Style And Design: The style and design of new construction and renovations should be influenced by the principles set forth in Illinois preservation
series publication 19, "Storefronts On Main Street: An Architectural History", a copy of which is on file with the village clerk.
6. Residential Coordination: The CBD blocks should be designed and maintained as coordinated, mixed use units linked visually to neighboring CBD
blocks.
7. Sidewalks: All CBD blocks should have sidewalks on all four (4) sides.
8. Vehicular Access: Vehicular access to parking and service areas within the CBD should be provided at a limited number of locations.
9. Parking: Parking should be integrated into CBD development in a manner that will minimize visibility from public streets, unless appropriately
screened from public view from adjacent properties with such landscaping, fencing, or other means as shall comply with the regulations of this article
and that shall be approved by the architectural board of review pursuant to the site plan approval process required by section 10-6A-10 of this article.

10-11-7: TREE REPLACEMENT:
A. General Requirements: Any protected tree damaged or removed in the course of a regulated activity must be replaced by the applicant pursuant to this
section and as depicted in a tree replacement plan pursuant to subsection I of this section, regardless of whether the protected tree is located on the
same lot on which the regulated activity takes place; except, that the village forester may, pursuant to subsection G of this section, consider a request
to submit a fee in lieu of the replacement of trees, and except for the exemptions in subsection B of this section. No replacement tree may have a
caliper less than one and one-half inches (11/2").
B. Exemptions: Tree replacement will not be required if the village forester determines that any of the following circumstances exist:
1. When a protected tree, due to natural causes, is dead, dangerous, or interferes with any existing or proposed public improvements, is in dangerous
proximity to any public utility lines or related facilities, or is a diseased tree or dangerous tree or otherwise unsafe, unhealthy, or insect infected and
constitutes a hazard to persons, property, or other trees.
2. When a protected tree, due to natural causes, obstructs any street, sidewalk, or any pedestrian path to an extent that the protected tree interferes
with free passage and clear view along the street, sidewalk, or path and at any street or driveway intersection.
3. When removal of a protected tree is necessary to comply with the current standards generally observed by professionals in the forestry profession.
4. When the removal involves only the removal of class D trees or exotic and invasive species and does not involve any protected tree.
5. When the protected tree to be removed is located within the foundation footprint of: a) a new residential building to be constructed on an
undeveloped lot in a zoning district, or b) an addition which creates additional gross floor area for an existing residential building, provided that the
combined gross floor area for the new residential building or existing residential building and the addition, as applicable, is compliant with the
maximum gross floor area restrictions for residential buildings under the zoning regulations and that the new residential building or the addition, as
applicable, does not require any variations. In these events, replacement trees will be required only for fifty percent (50%) of the removed protected
trees within the foundation footprint, at the replacement rate set forth in subsection C of this section.
6. When the protected tree to be removed is located within the foundation footprint of an addition which creates additional gross floor area for a
residential building designated as a landmark pursuant to this code; provided, that the combined gross floor area for the existing residential building
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 385/493
and the addition is compliant with the maximum gross floor area restrictions for the residential building under these zoning regulations, that the
addition does not require any variations, and that the village's historic preservation commission has conducted an advisory review pursuant to this
code and determined that the addition is consistent with the purposes and goals of the village's historic preservation regulations. In this event,
replacement trees will not be required for the removed protected trees within the construction footprint.
C. Replacement Formula: Protected trees must be replaced by group A trees pursuant to the replacement rate specified in this subsection. The tree
replacement rate is determined by the species of tree removed. For each inch of dbh removed, replacement trees must be provided at the rate shown
in the following table. For example, for every inch in diameter of a removed group A tree, each inch removed must be replaced with 1.25 inches in
diameter of replacement trees:
Species
Removed
Diameter Of
Tree Removed
Replacement
Rate
All public trees 1 inch 125 percent
Group A 1 inch 125 percent
Group B 1 inch 75 percent
Group C 1 inch 50 percent
D. Specifications: All replacement trees must be:
1. Provided by the applicant at the replacement rate specified in subsection C of this section;
2. Of a species listed in group A set forth in appendix A, section 10-11-13 of this chapter;
3. At least one and one-half (11/2) caliper inches;
4. In conformance with the nursery stock standards; provided, however, that in the event that the implementation or enforcement of the nursery stock
standards conflicts with the implementation or enforcement of the tree care standards, the provisions of the tree care standards will control;

time shall commence upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for the property as required pursuant to the village building regulations or, if
no final certificate of occupancy is required, upon completion of the tree replacement plan as determined by the village forester pursuant to subsection I
of this section. The care and feeding of newly planted trees must, at a minimum, adhere to the tree care standards.
F. Alternative Locations: The village forester may reduce the number of replacement trees to be planted on the subject property and designate alternative
locations for new trees on the subject property upon determining that full tree replacement will result in unreasonable crowding of trees or would be
otherwise inconsistent with current standards generally observed by forestry professionals. If the village forester cannot identify an appropriate
alternative location on the subject property for a tree, that tree may be replaced by a fee in lieu of replacement pursuant to subsection G of this section.
G. Fee In Lieu Of Replacement:
1. Modification Of Tree Replacement Requirement: The village forester may waive or modify any portion of the tree replacement requirements if the
village forester determines that replacing trees at the full replacement rate provided by subsection C of this section would:
a. Result in the unreasonable crowding of trees upon the subject property or upon a public right of way immediately adjacent to the subject property;
or
b. Adversely impact the viability of existing trees on the subject property; or
c. Not be consistent with the current standards generally observed by professionals in the forestry profession.
2. Calculation Of Fee: Upon a determination by the village forester that an applicant has demonstrated one or more of the above, in lieu of providing
replacement trees at the required replacement rate, the tree replacement plan will be modified to require the applicant to: a) replace the tree(s) at the
replacement rate in subsection C of this section; and b) pay a tree replacement mitigation fee as provided in section 1-12-3 of this code, under the
category "development fees". All tree replacement mitigation fees collected by the village will be used to promote the purposes of planting and
maintaining trees in the village.
H. Waiver Or Modification Of Provisions: Where a previous zoning or subdivision approval contains conditions which fully accomplish the goals and
purposes of this chapter, the board of trustees may waive or modify the requirements of this section. The waiver or modification may be revoked at any
time that any condition imposed pursuant to the approval is violated.

the property until the village forester approves of the implementation of the tree replacement plan.
J. Security Requirements:
1. Security Required: Every tree replacement plan must be accompanied by a tree replacement security, except as modified or waived by the village
forester pursuant to subsection J5 of this section. The tree replacement security must consist of:
a. A cash deposit to be held in escrow by the village;
b. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a lender authorized to issue the letter by any state or by the United States;
c. A bond with good and sufficient surety; or
d. Another form of security approved by the village administrator.
2. Amount: The amount of the tree replacement security will be determined by the village forester and must be equal to three (3) times the total actual
cost of strictly complying with and fully implementing the tree replacement plan, with any applicable adjustment for cost of living increases and/or
inflation.
3. Replenishment Of Security: If, at any time, the village forester determines that the funds remaining in the tree replacement security are not or may
not be sufficient to pay, in full, the total actual costs of strictly complying with and fully implementing the tree replacement plan, then, within ten (10)
days following a demand by the village, the applicant must increase the amount of the tree replacement security to an amount determined by the
village forester to be sufficient to pay the uncovered costs. Failure to so increase the amount of the tree replacement security will be grounds for the
village to retain or draw down any remaining balance of the tree replacement security.
4. Return Of Security: Upon completion of the tree replacement plan pursuant to subsection I3 of this section, the tree replacement security, or any
remainder thereof, will be returned or released to the applicant.
5. Limited Waiver: Where a tree permit application concerns the damage or removal of trees unrelated to construction activity, the village forester may,
upon consultation with the building commissioner, modify or waive the requirement for submittal of the tree replacement security if the village forester
determines that the tree replacement security is not necessary for the limited damage or removal and that the purposes of this chapter will be fulfilled
without submittal of the tree replacement security.
K. Failure To Comply:
1. Notice: If, at any time, the village forester determines that the applicant has failed to comply with or implement the tree replacement plan, the village
forester will cause notice of the failure to be served upon the applicant and will order the applicant to fully comply with the tree replacement plan
within fourteen (14) days following mailing or personal delivery of the notice. The notice must be personally served or sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the applicant and must notify the applicant that, absent an appeal pursuant to subsection K3 of this section, unless full
compliance with the tree replacement plan is achieved within fourteen (14) days from the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice, the village
may proceed to perform or cause to be performed work the village forester determines necessary to achieve full compliance with the tree
replacement plan.
2. Opportunity To Comply: Absent an appeal pursuant to subsection K3 of this section, within thirty (30) days following mailing or personal delivery of
the required notice, the applicant must take action as is necessary to strictly comply with and implement the tree replacement plan.
3. Appeal: Within fourteen (14) days following personal delivery or mailing of the required notice, the applicant may appeal the village forester's
determination by filing a written notice of appeal with the village administrator. The filing of an appeal will toll the thirty (30) day period in which the
applicant is required to take action pursuant to subsection K2 of this section from the date on which the village administrator receives the applicant's
notice of appeal. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the village administrator will review all reliable and relevant documents and information
pertaining to the village forester's determination. The village administrator must render a written decision on the appeal no later than fourteen (14)
days after the village administrator receives the written notice of appeal. The village administrator must notify the applicant of the village
administrator's decision within two (2) days after the decision and must provide the applicant a copy of the decision. The action taken by the village
administrator will be final. The tolling of the thirty (30) day period will cease upon the applicant's receipt or notice of the village administrator's
decision.
4. Village Right To Complete Work: If the applicant neglects or refuses to fully comply with and implement the tree replacement plan within the thirty
(30) day period pursuant to this subsection, then the village forester, with the consent of the village administrator, and, if applicable, upon the denial
of any applicable appeal, will be authorized to perform or to cause to be performed work necessary to ensure strict compliance with and full
implementation of the tree replacement plan. The village forester will have the right to deduct, liquidate, draw down, or apply an amount equivalent to
three (3) times the actual costs of the work from the tree replacement security, as well as to exercise all other rights and remedies available to the
village, including, without limitation, any applicable lien rights. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-2008; amd. 2009 Code; Ord. 2011-23, 11-28-2011)

9. A tree survey for the subject property, which depicts the location and tag number of each tree described in the tree inventory. The tree survey must
include, without limitation, a legend referencing the tag number, dbh, species, general condition, and proposed disposition of existing protected trees
located on or near the subject property and trees other than protected trees that are reasonably likely to be damaged or removed during the
construction activity. The tree survey must also depict the planned location of all proposed trees to be planted or replanted on or near the subject
property pursuant to the tree replacement plan.
10. An action plan for the subject property, consisting of a listing of the trees on the subject property, in chart form, that identifies each tree by tag
number and shows, for each tree, the following information: species, size in dbh, condition, form, percent of critical root zone saved, and the
anticipated damage, removal, tree protection measures, or other action to be taken regarding each tree.
11. Detailed specifications for maintenance and protection of protected trees and for the maintenance and protection of trees other than protected trees
that are reasonably likely to be damaged or removed during implementation of the proposed construction activity, including, without limitation,
proposed measures such as construction pruning, root pruning, critical root zone protection, installation of a retaining wall or high visibility fencing,
and auguring of utility lines when auguring is determined by the village forester to be necessary to improve the chances of tree survival.
12. Detailed specifications for tree protection fencing on the subject property, to be placed at a minimum: a) along the property frontage from property
line to property line to completely separate the construction activity area; and b) around the critical root zone of each protected tree. These
specifications must also include the identification and clear delineation on the site plan of the construction activity area and the tree protection area
and their respective perimeters.
D. Protection Area: The tree protection area is the area of the subject property not included in the construction activity area. No construction activity may
be conducted in the tree protection area. All reasonable measures and protective materials must be employed to preserve and safeguard trees located
within the tree protection area. Protective materials must include, without limitation, the temporary installation of high visibility fencing or other similar
materials in the sizes and at the locations specifically approved by the village forester. All protective measures and materials must be in place and
approved by the village forester prior to the commencement of any construction activity. Protective materials may not be removed until the village
forester approves the removal after the completion of all construction activity. No attachments, fences, or wires, other than those approved for bracing,
guying, or wrapping, may be attached to any protected tree during the construction activity.
E. Stop Work Order:
1. If the protective measures and materials required by this section, or any other related measures or materials otherwise required by this chapter, are
not fully implemented and completely constructed prior to commencement of construction activity, the village forester or the building commissioner
may issue a stop work order until the applicant fully complies with the requirements of this chapter.
2. If protective measures and materials constructed and employed on the subject property are not adequately maintained in a manner that protects
protected trees and the tree protection area, the village forester may issue a stop work order until the measures and materials are repaired, restored,
and constructed to the satisfaction of the village forester. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-2008)
10-11-9: DANGEROUS OR DISEASED TREES:
A. Diseased Trees: The following trees are trees that are diseased and will be referred to as "diseased trees":
1. Trees of any species or variety infected with Dutch elm disease or oak wilt, as determined by laboratory analysis or by any other reliable means.

2. Trees or parts thereof of elm or zelkova, or of any other species, in a dead or dying condition that are infested with or may serve as breeding places
for the European elm bark beetle, Dutch elm disease, or oak wilt.
3. Trees or parts thereof of ash or any other species that are infested with or may serve as breeding places for the emerald ash borer.
B. Dangerous Trees:
1. Every owner or occupant of any house, building, lot or premises in the village must keep trees located on his property trimmed and maintained so as
to prevent or remove the following conditions:
a. Any tree which is dead, dangerous, or likely to fall or that is so unsafe, unhealthy, diseased, or insect infested as to constitute a hazard to persons,
property or other vegetation;
b. The obstruction of any street or sidewalk to any extent which interferes with free passage and clear view along the streets and sidewalks and at
any street or driveway intersection;
c. The obstruction of any sewer, drainageway, or septic field;
d. The dangerous proximity of any tree to public utility lines; and
e. The interference with any existing or proposed public improvement.
2. Any trees causing any of these conditions will be referred to as "dangerous trees".
C. Nuisance Declared And Prohibited: Dangerous trees and diseased trees are hereby declared to be a public nuisance. It shall be unlawful for any person
to keep, maintain, or possess a dangerous tree or a diseased tree located on any property in the village.
D. Notice Of Dangerous Or Diseased Trees: Whenever a dangerous tree or diseased tree is found to exist, the village forester will cause notice of the
nuisance to be served upon the owner and the occupant of the property where the dangerous or diseased tree is found, and will order the owner and
occupant to abate the nuisance within thirty (30) days following mailing or personal delivery of the notice. The notice must also: 1) notify the owner and
the occupant that, unless the nuisance is abated within the thirty (30) day period, the village may proceed to abate the nuisance, assess the cost
thereof against the property owner or occupant, and impose a lien for the cost on the affected property; 2) include a copy of this chapter, 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-20-12, the identification of the property, by common description, and the subject dangerous or diseased tree or trees; and 3) be
personally served or sent by registered mail to the person to whom was sent the last preceding general tax bill for the property upon which the
dangerous or diseased tree is located. A copy of said notice must also be mailed to the occupant of the property if the occupant is not the same person
to whom the notice is addressed.
E. Abatement Procedures; Lien Provisions: Within thirty (30) days following delivery or mailing of the notice required by subsection D of this section, the
owner or the occupant of the property must cause the nuisance to be removed or otherwise abated. If the owner or occupant neglects or refuses to
abate the nuisance as required by the notice issued pursuant to subsection D of this section, the village forester will promptly cause the abatement of
the nuisance by village employees or contractors. If the village forester so causes the abatement of the nuisance, all direct or indirect expenses
incurred in connection therewith, including the cost of collection, will be assessed against the property owner. In the event the expenses are not paid
upon billing, the village clerk, not more than sixty (60) days after performance of the work, may file a notice of lien against the property for the amount
of the expenses in the manner provided by statute.
F. Determination Of Diseased Trees: The village forester may, from time to time, conduct tests, analyses, and inspections as the village forester
determines necessary to determine the existence of diseased trees throughout the village. All tests, analyses, and inspections will be at the sole cost
and expense of the village. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-2008)
10-11-10: INSPECTIONS AND SURVEYS:
The village forester will, on a regular basis, conduct inspections and surveys as necessary to monitor the trees in the village and to determine the
existence, nature, and extent of violations of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-2008)
10-11-11: APPEALS:
A. Overview: The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, ill considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to
avoid the need for resort to legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as
means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this chapter or the rightful authority of the village forester to enforce the requirements of
this chapter. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this chapter and to
the reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with the administration of this chapter.
B. Appeal To Village Administrator: Appeals from any decision of the village forester may be taken by an applicant or any other person adversely affected
by the decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the village administrator within five (5) days following receipt or notice of the village forester's
decision. Upon receipt of the written notice of appeal, the village administrator will review the relevant evidence, documents, or information, and may
receive and consider new evidence. The village administrator will render a written decision and transmit such decision to the appealing party within
fourteen (14) days after receipt of the written notice of appeal. The decision of the village administrator will be final except for appeals to the board of
trustees pursuant to subsection C of this section.
C. Final Appeal To Village Board Of Trustees: In cases concerning tree replacement requiring a replacement rate pursuant to subsection 10-11-7C of this
chapter of one hundred inches (100") or more, a party may appeal the village administrator's decision to the board of trustees within fourteen (14) days
after its transmittal to that party by filing a written notice of final appeal with the board of trustees. Upon receipt of the written notice of final appeal, the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 389/493
board of trustees will review the relevant evidence, documents, or information and may receive and consider new evidence. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the written notice of final appeal, the village board of trustees will render a written decision at a regularly scheduled meeting. Such decision
may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order or determination as, in the opinion of the board
of trustees, is proper to be made in the circumstances. If no regularly scheduled meeting occurs within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of final
appeal, the board of trustees will render its written decision at the next regularly scheduled board meeting thereafter. The written decision of the village
board of trustees will be final.
D. Stay Of Regulated Activities: The filing of a written notice of appeal pursuant to this section will operate as a stay of the regulated activities related to
that appeal, and no such regulated activity may proceed until a final decision is rendered on the appeal pursuant to this section. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-
2008)
10-11-12: PENALTIES:
Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with, violates, or assists in the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, or any order, permit, or
notice issued pursuant hereto, will be subject to a fine of not less than twenty five dollars ($25.00) nor more than the maximum provided in section 1-4-1 of
this code for each violation. Each tree which is removed or damaged will constitute a separate violation. Each day any violation continues will constitute a
distinct and separate violation. In addition to the penalties provided in this section, any damaged or removed tree must be replaced pursuant to the tree
replacement requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-22, 9-9-2008; amd. 2009 Code)
10-11-13: APPENDIX A, SPECIES RATING GUIDE:
The intent of this guide is to identify tree species by genetic quality and community value and to assign them to a species group based on these two (2)
criteria. The species groups are noted as A, B, C, and D. Species group A is the most highly rated group. Species group D is the lowest rated group and
includes the tree species that are not protected in this chapter. The species rating guide is the basis for assessing the relative value of trees to be
protected and mitigated if they are damaged or removed.
This guide represents the tree species that are considered to be the most common tree species in the community. This guide is not an attempt to list all
tree species that could successfully grow in the community. In the event that the village forester encounters a tree species that is not listed in this rating
guide, then it shall be the responsibility of the village forester to assign that tree species to the appropriate species group.

Chapter 12
BLUFFS AND RAVINES
10-12-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The village ravine and bluff areas provide a unique natural resource to the village and to its residents that must be preserved and protected. Bluffs and
ravines are inherently fragile and subject to erosion due to glacially formed soils containing unstable sediment, rock, and silt. Development and
construction activity in and around bluffs and ravines could be hazardous to people and property and could accelerate the erosion process. The purpose
and intent of this chapter is to accomplish the following goals through the establishment of reasonable regulations to protect and maintain bluffs and
ravines in the village:
A. Protect people and property against damage or destruction caused by accelerated erosion resulting from development and construction activities in or
around bluffs and ravines.
B. Protect bluffs and ravines against unnecessary damage or destruction caused by certain development and construction activities.
C. Maintain proper water runoff in order to decrease the effects of erosion on bluffs and ravines.
D. Minimize the disruption or alteration of natural drainage occurring in or around bluffs and ravines.
E. Protect the property values of properties on which bluffs and ravines are located.
F. Preserve and enhance the physical and aesthetic qualities of bluffs and ravines by, among other things, minimizing the disruption or damage to existing
vegetation. (Ord. 99-9, 3-8-1999)
10-12-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply generally and uniformly to all areas and zoning districts within village. The provisions of this chapter shall also
apply cumulatively and simultaneously with the other provisions of this title and the village subdivision regulations and building codes, and no approvals or
permits issued pursuant to such regulations or codes shall be deemed to authorize any activity that does not also comply with the applicable provisions of
this chapter. Furthermore, if ever a provision of this chapter and another provision in this title or the village subdivision regulations or building codes are
inconsistent, provisions resulting in the maximum protection and preservation of bluffs and ravines shall govern, except where limited by law. (Ord. 99-9, 3-
8-1999)
10-12-3: SETBACK REQUIREMENTS:

extent possible. Runoff from impervious surfaces shall be conveyed to existing storm sewers, wherever possible, or, if approved by the village
engineer, channeled into the bluff or ravine in a manner to minimize the impact or damage to the bluff or ravine protection area. (Ord. 99-9, 3-8-1999;
amd. Ord. 2016-17, 6-27-2016)
10-12-6: CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ON BLUFF AND RAVINE PROPERTY:
The following restrictions and requirements shall apply to all construction activities on bluff/ravine property:
A. Plat Of Survey Required: Unless otherwise waived by the village engineer, any application for a building permit for any construction activity on any
bluff/ravine property shall include a plat of survey prepared within one year of the date of application for the subject permit. The plat shall be sealed by
a licensed surveyor and shall include, at a minimum, the following elements and information:
1. The lot lines of the bluff/ravine property;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 395/493
2. The curvilinear line defining the top ravine edge or top bluff edge, or both, as the case may be (see section 10-13-1, illustrations 15A and 15B of this
title);
3. The total square footage of the bluff/ravine property along with supporting calculations;
4. The location of all existing improvements on the bluff/ravine property in relation to the top ravine edge or the top bluff edge, or both, as the case may
be;
5. The location of all proposed new improvements in relation to the top ravine edge or the top bluff edge, or both, as the case may be, clearly
distinguished from existing improvements (see section 10-13-1, illustrations 15A and 15B of this title);
6. The existing and proposed grades;
7. The existing and proposed top of foundation elevations, using the same elevation data as used for site grades;
8. Bench mark with elevation and location clearly defined;
9. The location of all existing and proposed utility lines, including storm drainage facilities; and
10. A demonstration of the ways in which the applicant will ensure that all construction activities are in compliance with this chapter and that all such
activities will be performed in a manner: a) to cause the least possible disruption of the natural features of a bluff or ravine protection area; and b) to
be consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter as expressed in section 10-12-1 of this chapter.
B. Fencing: A temporary fence shall be erected along a line that is ten feet (10') from the top ravine edge or top bluff edge, or both, as the case may be,
during any development or construction activity on bluff/ravine property. For any construction activity that is permitted pursuant to this chapter to be
within said ten foot (10') area, such fencing as the village engineer shall determine is necessary to prevent adverse impacts on the ravine or bluff, or
both, as the case may be, shall be required. Any such fence shall be removed upon completion of the development or construction activity.
C. Grading And Restoration: Upon completion of any development or construction activity on bluff/ravine property, appropriate grading and restoration
work shall be performed, as required by the village engineer, in order to ensure protection of the bluff and ravine protection areas. (Ord. 99-9, 3-8-1999)
10-12-7: PROTECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF BLUFF AND RAVINE PROPERTY:
A. Filling And Dumping Prohibited: No garbage, construction debris, or landscaping materials shall be dumped or filled in any bluff or ravine protection
area.
B. Drainage: Measures shall be required to control stormwater runoff from structures and other improved surfaces on bluff/ravine properties. Wherever
feasible, such runoff shall be collected and carried to municipal storm drainage facilities located away from ravines and bluffs. If discharge directly into
municipal storm drainage facilities is not feasible, drainage shall be collected and discharged directly into the base of the ravine or bluff channel via
continuous, nonperforated drain lines designed to collect stormwater runoff prior to the runoff reaching the ravine or bluff area. Such drainage lines
shall be buried on the slopes of the ravine or bluff, and required excavations shall be located to minimize damage to trees and the slope of the ravine or
bluff. In no event shall the point source discharge of water be allowed on or near any side of any ravine or bluff. A complete site drainage plan shall be
required as part of the site plan submittal required pursuant to subsection 10-12-6A of this chapter.
C. Vegetation: Native vegetation shall be maintained to the greatest extent possible within all bluff and ravine protection areas. Section 10-13-1 of this title,

Lake Bluff Open Lands Association
P.O. Box 449
Lake Bluff, Illinois 60044
The ravines of Lake Bluff are essential to the ambiance of our unique village. The golden glow of sugar maples in the fall, which are indicative of
presettlement vegetation, and the showy snow-white trillium which blanket the slopes with other spring ephemerals before the trees leaf out, give us a very
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 421/493
special, natural setting, which we all treasure.
This is our special heritage, but as the density of Lake Bluff increases, it is crucial for the survival of our ravines that we are aware of the things that will
enhance them as well as practices that will cause their destruction.
Ravine slopes are fragile deposits left from the ice age, of moraine glacial "till" or gravel, laid on heavy clay. Because of this, they erode easily, especially if
ground vegetation is compacted or destroyed by being walked on, or covered with layers of leaves dumped from adjacent lawns.
The drainage from the impervious surfaces of our streets, sidewalks, houses and garages gravitates into the ravine system and on into Lake Michigan. As
rainwater and sprinkler water pass through lawns near ravines, chemical fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides used to grow grass are picked up and
passed on into the highly sensitive ravine ecosystem at great cost to its plants, shrubs and wildlife.
The ravine understory of spring wildflowers is splendid, but fragile. If hybrid garden species (exoticaliens) are planted in landscapes at the edge of the
ravine or on the slopes, they "escape", spread and crowd out wildflowers and ground cover. These lovely native plants are more shade tolerant, easy to
maintain (need no watering or weeding) and are appropriate to the area.
The following are native wildflowers, shrubs, intermediate and shade trees that thrive in the ravinescape. They love that habitat and will love you if you
enhance your ravine property with their natural beauty.
Some ravine homeowners' responsibilities are to plant native material, fertilize organically (no insecticides or herbicides) and mulch, do not dump (leaves
and grass clippings).

Chapter 14
PLANNED COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS (PCDs)
10-14-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Authority: The board of trustees may grant special use permits pursuant to this chapter and section 10-4-2E of this title to authorize the development of
planned commercial developments ("PCDs") in the districts where PCDs are listed as a special use in the village's zoning use table in section 10-13-3
of this title.
B. Purpose: PCDs are a distinct category of special use. Within a PCD, the traditional use, bulk, space, and yard regulations may be relaxed if they impose
unnecessary rigidities on the proposed development or redevelopment of a parcel of land that requires an individual, planned approach. Through the
flexibility of a PCD, the village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives as appropriate for a particular proposed development, among others
that will be in the best interests of the village:
1. Stimulating creative approaches to commercial development of land;
2. Providing more efficient use of land;
3. Preserving natural features and providing open space areas and recreation areas in excess of those required under standard zoning regulations;
4. Developing and implementing new approaches to the living environment through variety in type, design and layout of buildings, transportation
systems, and public facilities;
5. Unifying buildings and structures through design;
6. Promoting long term planning to allow harmonious and compatible land uses or combination of uses with surrounding areas;
7. Promoting environmentally sound development practices;
8. Facilitating development in harmony with the village's comprehensive plan; and
9. Promoting the public health, safety, and welfare.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek PCD Approval: An application for a special permit to permit a PCD may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a
binding contractual interest in, the subject property.
D. Size Of Property: The provisions of this chapter apply to any project that includes four (4) acres or more of total land area. (Ord. 2013-12, 6-10-2013)
10-14-2: PROCEDURE:
A. Development Concept Plan:
1. Purpose: The development concept plan provides an applicant the opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope, character, and nature of
the entire proposed PCD without incurring undue initial costs. The initial required public hearing is based on the development concept plan, thus
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 441/493
permitting public consideration of the proposal at the earliest possible stage. Once approved, the development concept plan binds both the applicant
and the village to the following basic elements of development:
a. Categories of uses to be permitted;
b. General location of land uses;
c. Overall maximum intensity of uses;
d. The general architectural style of the proposed development;
e. General location and extent of public and private open space including pedestrian and recreational amenities;
f. General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems;
g. Preliminary staging of development;
h. General nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements, or contributions to be provided by the applicant; and
i. Other elements as may be included in the approved development concept plan.
2. Application: An application for approval of a development concept plan shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 10-14-6 of this
chapter.
3. Public Hearing: A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the PCZBA in accordance with subsection 10-4-2E of this title.
4. Action By PCZBA: Within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the public hearing, the PCZBA shall transmit to the board of trustees its
recommendation that the development concept plan either be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be approved. The failure of the
PCZBA to forward its recommendation within such sixty (60) days after completion of the public hearing, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the development concept plan as submitted.
5. Optional Submittal To The Architectural Board Of Review: After the conclusion of the public hearing by the PCZBA concerning the development
concept plan, the applicant may request that the architectural board of review conduct an informal workshop meeting pursuant to public notice for the
purpose of providing comments on the development concept plan, which meeting shall take place prior to the consideration of the development
concept plan by the village board.
6. Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the recommendation of the PCZBA, or its failure to act, as provided in
subsection A4 of this section, the board of trustees shall consider the recommendation of the PCZBA and then either shall deny the application for
approval of the development concept plan, shall refer it back to the PCZBA for further consideration of specified matters, or, by ordinance duly
adopted, shall approve the development concept plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
such approval; provided, however, that every such ordinance shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of a special use permit and final PCD in
accordance with subsection C of this section, and upon the applicant's compliance with all provisions of this code and the ordinance granting the
special use permit.
7. Effect Of Development Concept Plan Approval: Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing a final plan or shall fail to proceed with
development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any condition of this code or any approval
granted pursuant to it, the village shall not, without the consent of the applicant, take any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise impair an approved
development concept plan with respect to the elements of development set forth in subsection A1 of this section pending the application for approval
of a final plan. In submitting such plans, the applicant shall be bound by the approved development concept plan with respect to each such element.
B. Optional Submission Of A Final Plan: The applicant may submit a final plan for the proposed PCD pursuant to the requirements of subsection C of this
section simultaneously with the submission of the development concept plan. In that case, the applicant shall comply with all provisions of this code
applicable to submission of the development concept plan and to submission of the final plan. The elements of both the development concept plan and
the final plan may be combined into a single set of plans. The PCZBA, ABR, and the board of trustees shall consider such plans simultaneously and
shall grant or deny final plan approval in accordance with the provisions of subsections A, B, and C of this section.
C. Final Plan:
1. Purpose: The final plan is intended to particularize, refine, and implement the development concept plan and to serve as a complete, thorough, and
permanent public record of the planned commercial development and the manner in which it is to be developed.
2. Application: After approval of the development concept plan, the applicant shall file an application for final plan approval in accordance with the
requirements of section 10-14-6 of this chapter within one year after the date of such approval or in stages as approved in the development concept
plan. The application shall refine, implement, and be in substantial conformity with the approved development concept plan.
3. Public Hearing: A public hearing to consider the final plan shall be set, noticed, and conducted by the PCZBA in accordance with subsection 10-4-2E
of this title.
4. Coordination With Subdivision Ordinance: When a subdivision of land subject to the village's subdivision ordinance is proposed or required in
connection with a PCD, review of the subdivision, including, without limitation, submittal and approval of plats of subdivision, shall proceed
concurrently with review of the PCD and be completed simultaneously with review of and action on the final plan during the PCD process, and no
further public process shall be required for the PCD to obtain subdivision approval.
5. Action By PCZBA:
a. Evaluation: Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an application for approval of a final plan, the PCZBA shall, with such aid and advice of the
village staff and consultants as may be appropriate, review and act on the plan. Such review shall consider:
(1) Whether the final plan is in substantial conformity with the approved development concept plan; and
(2) The merit or lack of merit of any departure of the final plan from substantial conformity with the approved development concept plan; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 442/493
(3) Whether the final plan complies with any and all conditions imposed by approval of the development concept plan; and
(4) Whether the final plan complies with the provisions of this code and all other applicable federal, state, and village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
b. Recommendation Of Approval Based On Substantial Conformity: If the PCZBA finds substantial conformity between the final plan and the
approved development concept plan and further finds the final plan to be in all other respects complete and in compliance with any and all
conditions imposed by approval of the development concept plan and with the provisions of this code and all other applicable federal, state, and
village codes, ordinances, and regulations, it shall transmit the plan to the board of trustees with its recommendation that the board of trustees, by
ordinance duly adopted, approve the final plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such
approval, and shall grant a special use permit authorizing the final plan of the proposed PCD and such additional approvals as may be necessary
to permit development of the PCD as approved.
c. Recommendation Of Approval Without Substantial Conformity: If the PCZBA finds that the final plan lacks substantial conformity to the
development concept plan but merits approval notwithstanding such lack of conformity and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this code, it
shall transmit the plan to the board of trustees with its recommendation that the board of trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, approve the final
plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such approval, and shall grant a special use
permit authorizing the final plan of the proposed PCD and such additional approvals as may be necessary to permit development of the PCD as
approved.
d. Recommendation Of Denial: If the PCZBA finds that the final plan is not in substantial conformity with the approved development concept plan and
does not merit approval as a result of that nonconformity, or if the PCZBA requires modifications to the final plan that are not accepted by the
applicant, then the PCZBA shall transmit the plan to the board of trustees together with its recommendation that the final plan not be approved.
e. Failure To Act: The failure of the PCZBA to act within such sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
to be a recommendation to the board of trustees to approve the final plan as submitted.
6. Action By Architectural Board Of Review: Within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the public hearing by the PCZBA concerning the final plan,
the architectural board of review will conduct a public hearing for the purpose of conducting a site plan review pursuant to section 10-2-8 of this title
concerning the final plan. Within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the public hearing by the ABR, the ABR shall transmit to the board of trustees
its recommendation that a site plan be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be approved. The failure of the ABR to forward its
recommendation within such sixty (60) days after completion of the public hearing, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed a recommendation for the approval of the site plan as submitted.
7. Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the recommendation of the ABR, or its failure to act as provided in subsection
C6 of this section, the board of trustees shall proceed as follows:
a. Approval Based On Substantial Conformity: If the PCZBA has recommended approval of a final plan pursuant to subsection C5b of this section,
the board of trustees shall, unless it specifically rejects one or more of the findings of the PCZBA on the basis of expressly stated reasons,
approve the final plan by a duly adopted ordinance; or
b. Approval Without Substantial Conformity: In any case other than that specified in subsection C7a of this section, the board of trustees may, if it
finds that the final plan merits approval and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this title, approve the final plan by a duly adopted
ordinance; or
c. Referral Back To PCZBA: In any case other than that specified in subsection C7a of this section, the board of trustees may refer the final plan back
to the PCZBA for further consideration of specified matters; or
d. Conditions On Final Plan Approval: The approval of any final plan may be granted with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by
the applicant as a condition of approval.
8. Recording Of Final Plan: When a final plan is approved, the village administrator shall cause the final plan and special use permit ordinance, or the
portions thereof as are appropriate, to be recorded with the Lake County recorder.
9. Limitation On Final Plan Approval: Construction shall commence in accordance with the approved final plan within one year after the approval of
such plan, or within such time as may be established by the approved development schedule. Failure to commence construction within such period
shall, unless an extension of time shall have been granted by the village administrator, automatically render void the final plan approval and all
approvals of the planned commercial development and all permits based on such approvals, and the village administrator shall, without further
direction, initiate an appropriate application to revoke the special use permit for all portions of the planned commercial development that have not yet
been completed.
10. Building And Other Permits: Except as provided in subsection C9 of this section, appropriate officials of the village, after receiving notice from the
village administrator that the documents required for final plan approval have been approved and upon proper application by the applicant, may issue
building and other permits to the applicant for the development, construction, and other work in the area encompassed by the approved final plan;
provided, however, that no permit shall be issued unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of any codes or ordinances of
the village, in addition to this code, that are applicable to the permit sought, have been satisfied. Building permits may, however, be withheld at the
discretion of the village administrator or the board of trustees at any time it is determined that the development of the PCD is not undertaken in strict
compliance with the approved final plan. (Ord. 2013-12, 6-10-2013)
10-14-3: STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS:
A. Special Use Permit Standards: No special use permit for a PCD shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall
establish that the proposed PCD will meet each of the standards made applicable to special uses pursuant to subsection 10-4-2E3 of this title.
B. General Design Standards: No special use permit for a PCD shall be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish that the proposed
PCD will meet each of the following additional standards:
1. Comprehensive Plan: The PCD shall not be inconsistent with the planning policies, goals, objectives, and provisions of the village's comprehensive
plan.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 443/493
2. Public Welfare: The PCD shall be designed, located, and proposed to be operated and maintained so that it will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property and will not substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public health, safety and welfare.
3. Impact On Other Property: The PCD shall not be unnecessarily injurious to the use or enjoyment of surrounding properties for the purposes
permitted pursuant to the applicable zoning district, shall not prevent the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties
for permitted uses, shall not be inconsistent with the community character of the neighborhood, shall not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood, and shall not substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood, or be incompatible with other property in the
immediate vicinity. The uses permitted in a PCD must be of a type and so located so as to exercise no undue detrimental influence upon surrounding
properties. The PCD must also address compliance with the village's noise, lighting, and other performance standards.
4. Impact On Public Facilities And Resources: The PCD shall be designed so that adequate utilities, road access, drainage, and other necessary
facilities will be provided to serve the PCD.
5. Archaeological, Historical Or Cultural Impact: The PCD shall not substantially and adversely affect a known archaeological, historical, or cultural
resource located on or off of the parcel proposed for development.
6. Parking And Traffic: The PCD shall have or make adequate provision to provide ingress and egress to the proposed use in a manner that minimizes
traffic congestion in the public streets, provides appropriate cross access to adjacent properties and parking areas, and provides adequate access
for emergency vehicles. Adequate parking shall be provided for the uses permitted in the PCD.
7. Landscaping, Open Space, And Buffering: The PCD shall have comprehensive landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to
protect uses within the development and surrounding properties, including, without limitation, sufficient buffering to minimize the visual impact of the
PCD on surrounding properties.
8. Signage: Signage on the site of the PCD shall generally be in conformity with the village's sign regulations, except as may otherwise be specifically
provided in the ordinance approving a PCD.
9. Ownership/Control Area: The site of the PCD must be under ownership and/or unified control of the applicant.
10. Compliance With Subdivision Regulations And Plat Act: All PCDs, whether or not they are by definition subject to the village's subdivision
regulations or the Illinois plat act, shall comply with all standards, regulations and procedures of the village's subdivision regulations and the plat act
except as is expressly provided otherwise in this chapter, or as otherwise provided by the board of trustees pursuant to the ordinance approving the
PCD, or the applicable sections of the village's subdivision regulations.
11. Covenants And Restrictions To Be Enforceable By Village: All covenants, deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions to be recorded in
connection with the PCD, if any, shall provide that they may not be modified, removed, or released without the express consent of the board of
trustees and that they may be enforced by the village as well as by future landowners within the PCD.
12. Security And Site Control: The PCD shall include the plans necessary to describe, establish, and maintain appropriate property and building
security and site control measures for the PCD and the property on which the PCD is located. These plans shall also include measures to prevent
adverse impacts on neighboring properties.
13. Integrated Design: A PCD shall be laid out and developed as a unit in accordance with an integrated overall design. This design shall provide for
safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious grouping of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of space inside and outside
buildings to intended uses and structural features.
14. Beneficial Common Open Space: Any common open space in the PCD shall be integrated into the overall design. These open spaces shall have a
direct functional or visual relationship to the main building(s) and shall not be of isolated or leftover character. The following would not be considered
usable common open space:
a. Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual tenant or owner.
b. Dedicated streets, alleys and other public rights of way.
c. Vehicular drives, parking, loading and storage areas.
d. Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land.
15. Functional And Mechanical Features: Storage areas, trash and garbage retainers, machinery installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility
buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas and structures shall be accounted for in the design of the PCD and enclosed or made as

20. Surface Water Drainage: Special attention shall be given to proper site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it will not obstruct
the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
21. Zoning District Standards: If the zoning district regulations for the zoning district where the PCD is located impose additional standards to be met by
any PCD in that district beyond those in this chapter, a special permit for such development shall not be recommended or granted unless the
applicant shall establish compliance with such special standards.
22. Compliance With Tree Regulations: The PCD must comply with all standards, regulations and procedures of the village's tree regulations, as
provided in chapter 11 of this title.

service necessary to serve the PCD.
C. Conditions: The approval of a final plan may be conditioned on such matters as the board of trustees may find necessary to prevent or minimize any
possible adverse effects of the proposed PCD, or to ensure its compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency with the
general purposes, goals, and objectives of this code, the village's subdivision code, and the village's comprehensive plan. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance or resolution granting the approval in question. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of
this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the planned commercial development. (Ord. 2013-12, 6-10-2013)
10-14-4: AUTHORITY TO MODIFY REGULATIONS:
A. Authority: Subject to the standards and limitations in this section, the board of trustees, as part of an approval of any PCD, may modify or waive any
provision of this code or of the village's subdivision ordinance as they apply to an approved PCD.
B. Standards: No such modification or waiver may be approved unless the board of trustees shall find that the proposed PCD:
1. Will achieve the purposes for which PCD may be approved pursuant to section 10-14-1 of this chapter;
2. Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this code and the village's comprehensive plan;
3. Will result in a development providing compensating amenities to the village. "Compensating amenities" means features not otherwise required to
achieve compliance with the standards of this code or other applicable village codes and ordinances, including, without limitation, such things as
public art; plazas; pedestrian walkways; natural habitats; increased landscaping; buffering or screening; enhanced streetscape; enhanced pedestrian
and transit supportive design; underground parking; and similar features. Compensating amenities must be proposed as part of a PCD application,
and all compensating amenities, whether public or private, must be developed and constructed at the applicant's expense; and
4. Subject to the standards set forth in this subsection, a compensating amenity may be in the form of a cash contribution. If the board of trustees
approves a cash contribution in lieu of a compensating amenity, then the contribution must be made by the applicant to the village prior to the
issuance by the village of any permit authorizing construction related to the project. The contribution will be designated by the village specifically as
funding for a compensating amenity of the type described in subsection B3 of this section. The board of trustees may approve a cash contribution
only if: a) the project site is inadequate for any physical on site compensating amenity as a result of its size, shape, or other topographic feature, b)
there is no immediate need for a compensating amenity on public property abutting or adjacent to the project site, and c) there is a compelling and
appropriate compensating amenity, as determined by the board of trustees, for which a cash contribution can be designated.
C. Other Limitations: In granting any PCD approval pursuant to this chapter, the board of trustees shall in no event:
1. Make less stringent any performance standard relating to noise, vibration, smoke and particulate matter, odors, toxic and noxious matter, radiation
hazards, fire and explosive hazards, or heat or glare, that is applicable in the district in which the development is to be located or applicable to the
particular use by reason of the regulations applicable in any district in which it might be located; or
2. Reduce the minimum total lot area requirement by more than fifty percent (50%). This limitation does not apply to any minimum lot area per unit
requirement.
D. Regulation During And After Completion Of Development: After a final plan has been approved, that approved plan will constitute the regulations
applicable to the subject property, rather than any conflicting provision of this title. No use or development not authorized by the approved plan will be
permitted within the planned commercial development. (Ord. 2013-12, 6-10-2013)
10-14-5: ADJUSTMENTS AND AMENDMENTS TO APPROVED FINAL PLAN:
A. Minor Adjustments: During the development of a PCD, the village administrator in consultation with the village engineer may authorize minor
adjustments to an approved final plan only as described in subsection A1 of this section and only when the minor adjustments appear necessary to,
and consistent with, proper completion of the development as contemplated by the approval ordinance.
1. Types Of Minor Adjustments: Such minor adjustments shall be limited to the following:
a. Altering the location of any one structure or any part thereof, or any group of structures, by not more than twenty feet (20') or twenty five percent
(25%) of the distance shown on the approved final plan between such structure or structures and any other structure or any vehicular circulation
element or any boundary of the planned commercial development, whichever is less; and

e. Altering the location or type of landscaping elements, provided that such minor adjustment will not result in the reduction of required landscaping
or be inconsistent with the nature and type of landscaping required by the approved landscape plan.
2. Requirements For Minor Adjustments: Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of this title and the final plan, as
approved, shall be the minimum necessary to overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if they would result in a violation of any
standard or requirement of this code.
B. Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to an approved final plan not authorized by subsection A of this section shall be considered to be a major
adjustment and shall be granted only on application to, and approval by, the board of trustees after a public hearing conducted by the PCZBA. If the
board of trustees determines that a major adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the final plan as approved, then the board of trustees shall
refer the request to the PCZBA for further hearing and review as provided in subsection 10-14-2C of this chapter.
C. Amendments To Approved Final Plan After Completion Of Development: After completion of a PCD, an approved final plan may be amended, varied, or

10-15-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Authority: The Board of Trustees may grant special use permits pursuant to this chapter and subsection 10-4-2E of this title to authorize the
development of planned mixed-use developments ("PMDs") in the districts where PMDs are listed as a special use in section 10-13-3, "Zoning Use
Table", of this title.
B. Purpose: PMDs are a distinct category of special use. Within a PMD, the traditional use, bulk, space, and yard regulations may be modified if they
impose unnecessary rigidities on the proposed development or redevelopment of a parcel or parcels of land that require an individual, planned
approach. Through the flexibility of a PMD, the Village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives as appropriate and applicable for a particular
proposed development, among others that will be in the best interests of the Village:
1. Stimulating creative approaches to mixed use development of land;
2. Providing more efficient use of land;
3. Preserving natural features and providing open space areas and recreation areas in excess of those required under standard zoning regulations;
4. Developing and implementing new approaches to the living environment through variety in type, design and layout of buildings, transportation
systems, and public facilities;
5. Unifying buildings and structures through design;
6. Promoting long term planning to allow harmonious and compatible land uses or combination of uses with surrounding areas;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

7. Promoting environmentally sound development practices;
8. Facilitating residential, commercial, and mixed-used development in harmony with the Village's Comprehensive Plan;
9. Enhancing the character and vitality of the Village's Central Business District in harmony with adjacent residential neighborhoods; and
10. Promoting the public health, safety, and welfare.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek PMD Approval: An application for a special use permit to permit a PMD may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a
binding contractual interest in, the subject property.
D. Size Of Property: The provisions of this chapter apply to any project that includes one-half (0.5) acre or more of total land area. (Ord. 2016-23, 9-12-
2016)
10-15-2: PROCEDURE:
A. Preliminary Meeting With The Joint Plan Commission And Zoning Board Of Appeals: An applicant for a special use permit for a PMD is encouraged, but
is not required, to request to meet with the PCZBA prior to submitting a Development Concept Plan pursuant to subsection B of this section to obtain
feedback from the PCZBA on its potential application for a special use permit for a PMD. Such meeting shall occur at a public meeting of the PCZBA.
B. Development Concept Plan:
1. Purpose: The Development Concept Plan provides an applicant the opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope, character, and nature of
the entire proposed PMD without incurring undue initial costs. The initial required public hearing is based on the Development Concept Plan, thus

PCZBA shall make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees that the Development Concept Plan either be approved, be approved subject to
modifications, or not be approved. The failure of the PCZBA to make its recommendation by the second regularly-scheduled and held meeting of the
PCZBA after the conclusion of the public hearing, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a decision to make no
recommendation on the Development Concept Plan as submitted.
5. Optional Submittal To The Architectural Board Of Review: After the conclusion of the public hearing by the PCZBA concerning the Development
Concept Plan, the applicant may request that the Architectural Board of Review conduct an informal workshop meeting for the purpose of providing
comments on the Development Concept Plan, which meeting, if requested and held, shall take place prior to the consideration of the Development
Concept Plan by the Village Board.
6. Action By Board Of Trustees: Within sixty (60) days after the date of the recommendation of the PCZBA, or its failure to act, as provided in

approval of the Development Concept Plan, shall refer it back to the PCZBA for further consideration of specified matters, or, by ordinance duly
adopted, shall approve the Development Concept Plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
such approval; provided, however, that every such ordinance shall be expressly conditioned upon approval of a special use permit and Final Plan in
accordance with subsection C of this section, and upon the applicant's compliance with all provisions of this Code and the ordinance granting the
special use permit.
7. Effect Of Development Concept Plan Approval: Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing a Final Plan or shall fail to proceed
with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any condition of this Code or any
approval granted pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the consent of the applicant, take any action to modify, revoke, or otherwise impair an
approved Development Concept Plan with respect to the elements of development set forth in subsection B1 of this section pending the application
for approval of a Final Plan. In submitting such plans, the applicant shall be bound by the approved Development Concept Plan with respect to each
such element.

connection with a PMD, review of the subdivision, including without limitation submittal and approval of plats of subdivision, shall proceed
concurrently with review of the PMD and be completed simultaneously with review of and action on the Final Plan during the PMD process, and no
further public process shall be required for the PMD to obtain subdivision approval.
5. Action By PCZBA:
a. Evaluation: Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an application for approval of a Final Plan, the PCZBA shall, with such aid and advice of the
Village staff and consultants as may be appropriate, commence its public hearing to review and make its recommendation on the plan. Such
review shall consider:
(1) Whether the Final Plan is in substantial conformity with the approved Development Concept Plan; and
(2) The merit or lack of merit of any departure of the Final Plan from substantial conformity with the approved Development Concept Plan; and
(3) Whether the Final Plan complies with any and all conditions imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan; and
(4) Whether the Final Plan complies with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable Federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.

approved Development Concept Plan and further finds the Final Plan to be in all other respects complete and in compliance with any and all
conditions imposed by approval of the Development Concept Plan and with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable Federal, State,
and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations, it shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its recommendation that the Board of
Trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, approve the Final Plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a
condition of such approval, and shall grant a special use permit authorizing the Final Plan of the proposed PMD and such additional approvals as
may be necessary to permit development of the PMD as approved.
c. Recommendation Of Approval Without Substantial Conformity: If the PCZBA finds that the Final Plan is not in substantial conformity with the
Development Concept Plan but merits approval notwithstanding such lack of conformity and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this Code,
it shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its recommendation that the Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly adopted, approve the
Final Plan, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such approval, and shall grant a special
use permit authorizing the Final Plan of the proposed PMD and such additional approvals as may be necessary to permit development of the PMD
as approved.

Chapter 16
RECREATIONAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT (RIO)
10-16-1: PURPOSE:
The intent of this chapter is to adopt regulations and procedures specifically tailored to reflect and be consistent with: a) the unique use and form
considerations of public amenities as well as community and governmental functions, and b) the often highly specific needs of such uses as to location,
intensity of use, and massing, which regulations may be modified pursuant to the terms of this chapter if they impose unnecessary rigidities on the
proposed development or redevelopment of a parcel or parcels of land that require an individual, planned approach.
The Recreational, Institutional, and Open Space District (the RIO District) promotes the efficient use of land with a flexible set of regulations that meet
these highly specific needs in a manner that is intended to achieve and balance the objectives of:
A. Maximizing the predictability of land use and public benefits as a result of the development and use of property;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 455/493
B. Providing public amenities including schools, parks, open space, and recreational facilities;
C. Enhancing the character and vitality of RIO District properties in harmony with adjacent uses and residential neighborhoods;
D. Preserving natural, cultural, and historic features;
E. Minimizing the regulatory time and expense burden on the property owner; and,
F. Facilitating development in harmony with the Village's Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 2019-2, 1-28-2019)
10-16-2: PRIOR ZONING RELIEF IN THE RIO DISTRICT:
A. Continued Effect: Any applicable conditions of a prior variation, special use permit, or other zoning relief previously granted to property in the RIO
District shall remain in full force and effect, even when the prior authorized use no longer requires a special use permit or when the prior improvements
would not require zoning relief under the regulations of the RIO District.
B. Changes: Where the approval of a RIO Development Plan, pursuant to section 10-16-7 of this chapter, conflicts with the conditions of prior zoning relief,
the terms of the RIO Development Plan approval shall prevail. Additionally, a property owner subject to the conditions of prior zoning relief may, in

Churches, houses of worship, and other
assembly spaces
1 space per 6 seats in the main auditorium or largest room in the building, whichever is greater
Recreation:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 456/493
Indoor participatory (e.g., community
centers)
1 space per 3 occupants of area used by participants or per 3 maximum number of likely
participants at any one time, whichever is less
Outdoor participatory (e.g., tennis courts,
swimming pools)
2/3 of the maximum number of participants at any one time
Outdoor passive (e.g., playgrounds, trails,
shelters)
No minimum
Schools and day cares 1 space per employee
"Occupants" shall refer to the maximum legal occupancy permitted pursuant to the Village's building regulations set forth in title 9 of this Code.
"Maximum number of participants" is calculated based on the maximum number of participants likely to participate in the activity, as determined by
the Building Commissioner. For example, basketball is typically played with two (2) teams of five (5) players. Therefore, the maximum number of
participants is likely to be ten (10) at any one time for a full-size basketball court. As a further example, doubles tennis is played by four (4) players.
Therefore, the maximum number of participants is four (4) at any one time for a tennis court. The Building Commissioner shall not factor in
spectators and substitute players in establishing the maximum number of participants, but the Village may consider spectators, substitute players,
and other likely users of a property when considering whether to require additional minimum parking spaces as provided elsewhere in this section.
2. For All Other Uses: For all other uses not herein defined, there shall be a parking area of sufficient size to provide not less than one parking space
for each six hundred (600) square feet of the total floor area of any building or buildings, including all accessory buildings erected on the lot.
3. Fractional Spaces Excluded: Where determination of the number of required parking spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction shall not be included in calculating the minimum number of required parking spaces.
4. Uses In Bluffs And Ravines Excluded: That portion of any use which lies within a bluff protection area or a ravine protection area shall not be
included in calculating the minimum number of required parking spaces.
5. Credit For Street Parking: The number of minimum spaces required pursuant to this section shall be reduced by the number of lawful parking spaces
available on the public street adjacent to the site and not adjacent to any residential buffer yard.
6. Imposition Of Additional Minimum Parking: Notwithstanding anything contained in this title to the contrary, if the parking requirements of any use in
this district exceeds the ratios as hereinbefore defined, additional parking spaces shall be provided on the lot on which the use is situated. As a
condition of RIO Development Plan approval pursuant to section 10-16-7 of this chapter, the Village may require more on-site parking spaces than
may otherwise be required pursuant to this section to insure that there is adequate on-site parking to minimize traffic and parking congestion on the
public streets.
7. Existing Parking Non-Conformities: Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, the legal non-conforming status of any
deficiency in the required minimum number of parking stalls shall be protected unless, as a component of RIO Development Plan approval, the
Village determines a new use, or an increase in the intensity of an existing use, will generate additional parking demand above that previously
existing upon the site. (Ord. 2019-2, 1-28-2019)
10-16-6: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The performance standards in the RIO District shall be identical with the performance standards for the L-1 Light Industrial District as set forth in section
10-7A-7 of this title. (Ord. 2019-2, 1-28-2019)
10-16-7: RIO DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW:
No person may conduct or shall be entitled to establish a new use or obtain a building permit from the Village or other applicable permitting authority to
construct, reconstruct, alter, or move any building or structure on any property within the RIO District without the approval of a RIO Development Plan
unless exempt under subsection F of this section.
A. Intent: At the time of the creation of the RIO District, a significant area within the district has pre-existing development and uses that would frustrate the
application of traditional "planned development" tools. Accordingly, the RIO Development Plan process is designed to coordinate planning and zoning
review so as to accommodate incremental changes to existing buildings and uses. It also may be used by applicants proposing major or phased
development proposals over an extended period of time. The Village anticipates that users in the RIO District will, through long range planning and
public engagement, work cooperatively to further the public benefits of proposed development outside of this regulatory process.
B. Application Requirements: The application requirements for a RIO Development Plan review shall be the same as those required for site plan review
pursuant to subsection 10-2-8A of this title. Upon request, the Building Commissioner may exempt an applicant from including in its application any
required items if the Building Commissioner determines that a required item is not applicable or necessary for the consideration of the application. In
addition, the Building Commissioner and any reviewing body may request additional information necessary to evaluate the standards set forth herein.
Without limitation, this may include the submittal of traffic and parking studies by a qualified professional to ascertain the trip generation and parking
demand that would be created by a proposed use or development.
C. Procedure: The procedure and public notice requirements for RIO Development Plan review shall be the same as required for site plan review pursuant
to subsections 10-2-8B and C of this title, except that references to the Architectural Board of Review in subsections 10-2-8B and C of this title shall be
deemed references to the Joint Plan Commission and Zoning Board of Appeals.
D. Standards: No RIO Development Plan shall be approved by the Board of Trustees, and the Joint Plan Commission and Zoning Board of Appeals shall
not recommend approval of, a RIO Development Plan unless the applicant shall establish that the RIO Development Plan meets the following
standards, as each may be applicable:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 457/493
1. General Standard: Development in accordance with the RIO Development Plan will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent
property, the character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Land Use Policy: Development in accordance with the RIO Development Plan is consistent with the general and specific purposes and requirements
of this title, the RIO District, and the Village's Comprehensive Plan.
3. Public Facilities: The property, development in accordance with the RIO Development Plan, will be adequately served by essential public facilities
and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, and refuse disposal; or the applicant shall provide
adequately for such services as a condition of approval.
4. Traffic And Parking: Development in accordance with the RIO Development Plan would generate traffic demand compatible with surrounding uses
and road classifications. The RIO Development Plan provides adequate ingress and egress in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion and
provides adequate and appropriate parking, access to adjacent properties, and access for emergency vehicles.
5. Landscape And Open Space Buffering: The RIO Development Plan provides for landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to
minimize the visual impact of the development and to protect uses within the development and surrounding properties.
6. Pedestrian And Bicycle Access And Circulation: The RIO Development Plan provides for efficient and comprehensive pedestrian-friendly movement,
as well as efficient and comprehensive bicycle access and circulation.
7. Sensitive Areas And Features: The RIO Development Plan protects culturally sensitive areas and features; historic areas and features; and sensitive
natural, scenic, and ecological areas features such as ravines, wetlands, and bluffs.
E. Authority To Modify Regulations: The Board of Trustees, as part of the approval of any RIO Development Plan, may modify or waive any provision of
this Code or of the Village's subdivision ordinance as they apply to the approved RIO Development Plan ("deviations"), so long as the Board of
Trustees finds that the deviations:
1. Will achieve the purposes for which the RIO Development Plan may be approved pursuant to section 10-16-1 of this chapter;
2. Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this Code and the Village's Comprehensive Plan;
3. Will result in a development providing amenities to the Village that may not be otherwise required under this chapter or other applicable Village
codes and ordinances, including without limitation such things as public art; plazas; pedestrian walkways; natural habitats; increased landscaping;
buffering or screening; enhanced streetscape; enhanced pedestrian and transit supportive design; underground parking; and similar features. If
applicable, the proposed use for the property may itself be considered a compensating amenity when the proposed use is one that is open to the
public and provides a benefit to the community as a whole.
No finding of hardship or a unique condition by the Board of Trustees is necessary for the approval of a deviation of any provision of this Code or of
the Village's subdivision ordinance.
F. Exemptions: Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the following activities shall not require RIO Development Plan approval, except where: 1)
deviations from this title are necessary to proceed as provided in subsection E of this section or 2) where the activities would result in a "substantial
change" as that term is defined in section 10-16-9 of this chapter:
1. Maintenance to or repair of existing improvements, including, without limitation, any repainting, resurfacing; resealing; restriping; or repaving of
existing improvements.
2. Within an existing park, the addition, re-arrangement, or reconfiguration of playground equipment, recreational equipment, or open air shelters with
sides no more than fifty percent (50%) enclosed, provided that said activity does not increase the extent of any encroachment upon a residential
buffer yard required by this chapter.
3. Changes to landscaping, except where doing so would reduce the landscape screening provided within a residential buffer yard required by this
chapter.
Exception: The removal of Class D trees or any exotic and invasive species, as those terms are defined in chapter 11 of this title, shall not be
considered as a reduction in landscape screening.
4. The addition or reconfiguration of walking trails, paths, and other similar amenities for bicyclists and pedestrians, provided that such improvements
do not encroach upon a residential buffer yard required by this chapter.
5. Changes to signage subject to review by the Architectural Board of Review pursuant to chapter 10 of this title.
6. The reconstruction or reduction of the size of a building within the existing footprint of the building, or alterations to the interior of an existing building.
7. The modification or alteration of the facade of a building.
8. An increase to the footprint or size of an existing building or the construction or expansion of an accessory structure, provided such increase does
not qualify as a "substantial change", as that term is defined in section 10-16-9 of this chapter.
9. Other changes of comparable or lesser significance. (Ord. 2019-2, 1-28-2019)
10-16-8: EFFECT OF RIO DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL:
A. A RIO Development Plan approval shall be effective for a period of five (5) years from approval or an approval of an amendment thereto, provided that
the Village Board may extend such approval for an additional five (5) years upon a request from an applicant provided that the Village Board finds that
the RIO Development Plan still satisfies the standards set forth in subsection 10-16-7D of this chapter.
B. Except for any approvals required pursuant to section 10-16-9 of this chapter, upon approval of a RIO Development Plan, a property owner may

Board, which amendatory ordinance may be adopted only after a public hearing by, and recommendation of, the Joint Plan Commission and Zoning
Board of Appeals, in the same manner, and subject to the same standards, as an application for a new RIO Development Plan approval pursuant to
section 10-16-7 of this chapter.
B. Minor Change: The Village Administrator may approve changes to an approved RIO development that do not, in the sole and absolute discretion of the
Village Administrator, constitute a "substantial change" to the RIO development, in accordance with the following procedure:
1. The Village Administrator may approve the proposed minor change upon making a finding that the change is consistent with the intent and purpose

standards, as an application for a new RIO Development Plan approval.
4. The failure of the Village Board to ratify or deny a minor change within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of notice thereof shall be deemed a
ratification of the minor change.
C. Nothing in this section shall be deemed or interpreted as obligating the Village to grant any requested changes or amendments to an approved RIO
Development Plan. (Ord. 2019-2, 1-28-2019)

Chapter 4
PUBLIC OPEN SPACES; SCHOOLS AND CIVIC CONTRIBUTIONS
11-4-1: PURPOSE:
As a condition of final approval pursuant to this title and the village zoning regulations, any subdivision, resubdivision, or planned residential development
that results in a net increase of undeveloped single-family lots, as defined by the village zoning regulations, or the approval of building plans for multifamily
housing project(s) that result in a net increase of total dwelling units, as defined by the village zoning regulations, each developer, subdivider, or
owner, as the case may be (the "developer"), shall dedicate land for municipal, park and recreational, school, and library sites to serve the immediate and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 464/493
future needs of the residents of the development, or shall make cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedications, or a combination of both, at the option
of the village, in accordance with the criteria and formula contained herein. (Ord. 95-31, 10-9-1995)
11-4-2: DEFINITION OF BEDROOM:
For the purpose of this chapter, "bedroom" shall mean any room containing a closet, which is suitable to be used, or is used regularly as a sleeping area
and sharing a common hallway with or adjoining at least a three-quarter (3/4) bath, containing bathing or showering facilities. Rooms containing closets,
such as foyers, laundry rooms, mud rooms, and hallways, shall not be considered "bedrooms". (Ord. 95-31, 10-9-1995)
11-4-3: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
A. To the extent permitted by law, the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all subdivisions, resubdivisions, planned residential developments,
and annexations that result in a net increase of undeveloped single-family lots, as defined by the village zoning regulations, or the approval of building
plans for multi-family housing project(s) that result in a net increase of total dwelling units, as defined by the village zoning regulations: 1) within the
village; and 2) within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the village and outside its corporate limits so far as such extraterritorial requirements relate to
contributions for the respective school and park districts in which said land is located.
B. The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof required by this chapter shall also be required as a condition to the annexation of any land
to the village, and provisions therefor shall be incorporated into any preannexation agreement governing such land. The decision to require such
dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof rests solely with the village board of trustees.
C. In all instances where the developer of any property enters into an agreement relative to donation of cash or property, or a combination thereof, with
any donee governing agency pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the terms and conditions therefor shall be approved by the village board of
trustees. Under no circumstances shall any modification require a greater contribution than otherwise provided for herein. (Ord. 95-31, 10-9-1995)
11-4-4: CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES:
A. Criteria For Requiring Municipal Land Dedication:
1. Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication as determined
by the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit model created by the Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal
Consultants, Inc., latest edition, 1993, section 11-4-5 of this chapter.
2. Land Dedication Requirement: The land dedication requirement shall bear a direct relationship to the existing community standard of municipal
property dedicated to the provision of services and for the enjoyment of the residents of the village. The total land dedication requirement for
municipal purposes shall be 9.7 acres per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population.
B. Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreational Land Dedication:
1. Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication as determined
by the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit model created by the Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal
Consultants, Inc., latest edition, 1993, section 11-4-5 of this chapter.
2. Land Dedication Requirement: The land dedication requirement shall bear a direct relationship to the existing community standard of park district
property dedicated to the provision of services and for the enjoyment of the residents of the village and the Lake Bluff park district. The total
requirement shall be 7.3 acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following criteria:
Recreation Area Size Range Minimum Acres Per 1,000 Of Ultimate Population
Playground/minipark 1 to 3 acres 0.4
Neighborhood park 3 to 12 acres 1.4
Communitywide park 12 to 50 acres 5.5
Total 7.3
3. Location: The "Lake Bluff Park District Establishing Land Dedication Standards For Land Developers", adopted November 14, 1977, shall be used
as a guideline in locating sites. The type of recreation areas required for a particular site will be ascertained by the existence of facilities to service
the area, and the type of recreation area required may be substituted by the village board of trustees so as to achieve the criteria set forth herein. A
park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres shall be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve
equally the entire development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according to
established standards for park area distances.
4. Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas:
a. When developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation areas in subdivisions, resubdivisions, multifamily
projects, or planned residential developments may, at the option of the village board of trustees, be provided in the form of "private" open
space in lieu of dedicated "public" space. The extent of same shall be determined by the village board of trustees, based upon the needs of the
projected residents, the following criteria, and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 465/493
b. In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a dedication of a substantially greater amount of land as private open
space than provided normally, substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment, by the
developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the
village board of trustees before any credit is given for private recreation areas. The developer must also guarantee that these private recreation
areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private "swimming clubs" are included in
this provision. A copy of "Suggested Criteria For Swimming Pool Development", as adopted by the Lake Bluff park district, shall be used for
guidance by the developer. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land
dedication that would have been required from the subdivision, resubdivision, multi-family housing project or planned residential development, and
then subtract the credit to be given.
C. Criteria For Requiring School Site Land Dedication:
1. Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family
housing project shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be
determined by obtaining the ratio of: a) estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the b) maximum recommended
number of students to be served in each such school classification, as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the c) said minimum
recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. The ultimate
density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication as determined by the table of estimated
ultimate population per dwelling unit model created by the Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc., latest edition,
1993, section 11-4-5 of this chapter.
2. School Classifications And Size Of School Site: School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance
with the following criteria:
School Classification
By Grade
Maximum Number Of
Students For
Each Such School
Classification
Minimum Number Of
Acres Of Land For Each
School Site Of Such
Classification Requirement
Elementary school
Grades K _ 5
600 15
Junior high school
Grades 6 _ 8
900 30
High school
Grades 9 _ 12
1,500 50
3. Location: The standards adopted by the affected school districts shall be used as a guideline for locating sites.
D. Criteria For Requiring Library Land Dedication:
1. Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication as determined
by the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit model created by the Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal
Consultants, Inc., latest edition, 1993, section 11-4-5 of this chapter.
2. Land Dedication Requirement: The land dedication requirement shall bear a direct relationship to the existing community standard of library property
dedicated to the provision of services and for the enjoyment of the residents of the village. Recognizing the peculiar nature of the library site, the
village shall, upon receipt of an impact statement which describes how the new development, subdivision, annexation, planned residential
development, or housing project will affect the library, donate a portion of the dedication that the village is entitled to, pursuant to subsection A of this
section, to the library for the purposes of alleviating said impact and maintaining service levels to the new and existing residents. The total land
dedication requirement of library property shall be 0.05 acre of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population, plus ten percent (10%) of the
total municipal dedication, which ten percent (10%) shall be devoted from the otherwise applicable dedication requirements set forth in subsection A
of this section.
E. Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Municipal, Park And Recreational, School And Library Sites:
1. Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for municipal, park and
recreational, school or library purposes, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication
required. The cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required shall be handled as follows:
a. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the
village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to service immediate or future needs
of the residents of that subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family housing project or for the improvement of other
existing local park and recreation land which already serve such needs.
b. The cash contributions in lieu of municipal sites shall be held in trust by the village solely for use in the acquisition of land for municipal purposes
to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family housing
project, or for the improvement of other existing municipal lands which already serve such needs.
c. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the village, solely for use in the
acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential
development or multi-family housing project, or for the improvement to any existing school sites which already serve such needs.
d. The cash contributions in lieu of library sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the village, solely for use in the
acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs from that subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 466/493
multi-family housing project, or for the improvement to any existing library facilities which already serve such needs.
2. If any portion of cash contribution in lieu of municipal, park and recreational, school or library land dedication is not expended for the purposes set
forth herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution by the governmental body
holding the money after the expiration of the tenth year.
F. Lots That May Remain Undeveloped:
1. When a developer or subdivider represents that there are no plans to build on or sell any or all of said undeveloped single-family residential lots, the
village board of trustees may, at its election, agree to defer the cash contributions therefor otherwise payable thereunder to the first occurring of
either the sale of, or the application for a building permit for, each of said lots. In such cases, the amount of the cash contributions shall be based on
the fair market value of land, as defined in subsection G of this section, at the time of said sale or application for a building permit, and on the density
formula described in subsection I of this section as then in effect, and the developer shall provide the village with such security guaranteeing the
payment of such future contributions as the village board of trustees deems appropriate. The obligation to make such future contributions shall be set
forth on the recorded plat of subdivision, resubdivision, multi-family housing project, or planned residential development, and no building permit shall
be issued for any lot included in said plat until the contributions therefor have been paid.
2. In the event the contributions provided for herein become payable when there are no plans to build a residence on a lot included in said plat, the
contributions therefor shall be based on the size of the residence which the village board of trustees, taking into account the location of said property,
the trend of residential construction in the village and all other relevant information, then determines what would represent the highest and best use
of said lot. (Ord. 95-31, 10-9-1995)
G. Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land required pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be based on the "fair market value" of
the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as municipal, park and recreation, school and
library sites. It has been determined that the "fair market value" of improved land in the village is not less than the per acre amount set out in section 1-
12-3 of this code, under the category "development fees", and that such figure shall be the minimum used in making any calculation required pursuant
to this chapter. The village may, on the basis of a qualified appraisal, establish a valuation for a particular parcel of land which is higher than the per
acre amount set out in section 1-12-3 of this code, under the category "development fees". Should the developer object to the minimum valuation or
any valuation determined by the village, the developer shall file a written objection thereto and shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value"
of such improved land in the area of the proposed development or other evidence thereof. Final determination of said "fair market value" per acre of
such improved land shall be made by the village board of trustees based upon information submitted by the developer and from sources which may be
submitted to the village board of trustees by the affected park district, school district, or others. The minimum valuation set forth herein shall be
reviewed annually by the village and adjusted in section 1-12-3 of this code, under the category "development fees", upon determination by the village
board of trustees that a change is required. (Ord. 2005-11, 5-9-2005)
H. Criteria For Requiring A Combination Of Land Dedication And A Fee In Lieu Of Land: There will be situations in subdivisions, resubdivisions, planned
residential developments, or multi-family projects when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
1. Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a municipal, park and recreation, school or library site. That portion of the
land within the subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family housing project falling within the municipal, park and
recreational, school or library location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any
additional land that would have been required to be dedicated.
2. A major part of the municipal, park and recreation, school or library site has already been acquired and only a small portion of the land is needed
from the development to complete the site. Those remaining portions shall be acquired by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be
required for any additional land that otherwise would have been required to be dedicated.
I. Density Formula: The table of estimated population per dwelling unit, section 11-4-5 of this chapter, is generally indicative of current and short range
projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the developer or subdivider. In the event a developer files a written objection to
the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit provided herein, the developer shall submit his own demographic study showing the
estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family housing project,
and in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board of trustees based upon
such demographic information submitted by the developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board of trustees by the
affected park district, school districts, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and
the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.
J. Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or
school sites, or for municipal purposes, in a particular subdivision or development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond
the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village; provided, that such
acquisition is made within one year from the date of final approval of the subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family
housing project.
K. Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision, resubdivision, planned residential development or multi-family housing project is less
than forty (40) acres, public open space or a school site or municipal site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with
dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable municipal, park and recreation, school or library sites without hardship on a
particular developer.
L. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for municipal, park and recreational, school and library uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land.
M. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including drainage and curb and
gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefor. (Ord. 95-31, 10-9-1995)

11-5-3: APPENDIX C, DESIGN STANDARDS:
APPENDIX C
Village Of Lake Bluff
Subdivision Design Standards
Standards and details of design contained herein are intended only as minimum requirements to enable the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision to be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the design and development of the plat, the subdivider shall use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure a pleasant and desirable neighborhood.
(1)Streets:
(a) Continuation Of Existing Streets: Proposed streets shall provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or recorded)
in adjoining property, in similar alignment, and at equal or greater width, but not less than sixty six (66) feet in width. All streets shall be carried to
the proposed subdivision boundary unless otherwise recommended by the plan commission and approved by the village board. Where
unsubdivided land adjoins the proposed subdivision, provisions shall be made, where necessary, for the extension of streets into such
unsubdivided area. Such provision may include leaving vacant land which would be required to extend such streets to this area; or when the
subdivision of such area can be foreseen in the near future, this provision may include street construction to the boundary of such area.
(b) Rights Of Way: Minimum widths for street right of way shall conform to the following schedule and enclosure 1 to appendix D, section 11-5-4 of
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=805 472/493
this chapter:
Residential collector streets: Eighty (80) feet.
Residential streets, no parking: Sixty six (66) feet.
Residential street, parking one side: Sixty six (66) feet.
Commercial, industrial streets and thoroughfares, parking on both sides: Eighty (80) feet.
Cul-de-sac streets: Sixty six (66) feet.
(c) Thoroughfares Involved In Subdivision: Where a new subdivision involves frontage on an existing state highway, route or county highway
access, egress approval must be obtained from the county and state in addition to that of the village. Example of thoroughfares, see enclosure 1 to
appendix D, section 11-5-4 of this chapter.
(d) Railroads Involved In Subdivision: If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
(1) Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade separations at highway crossings of the railroad. (Crossing to be at right angles.)
(2) Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the railroad; or form a buffer strip
for park, commercial or industrial area.
(3) Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to permit lots to back thereonto.
(e) Land Not Platted: Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the plan commission may require
topography and a sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided portion.
(f) Physical And Cultural Features: In general, streets shall be platted with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other
natural features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
(g) Neighborhood Plan: If an overall plan has been made by the plan commission for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is
located, the street system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
(h) Circulation: The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the plan commission. In a case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the
plat, but is temporarily dead ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
(i) Street Intersections: Street intersections shall intersect at an angle of not less than seventy five (75) degrees. When this criteria cannot be met,
the centerlines shall intersect at right angles by means of curves.
(j) Dead End Streets: Permanent dead end streets shall be discouraged, where a reasonable substitute for a dead end street exists. Where a dead
end street is of a temporary nature, awaiting its extension into adjoining undeveloped land, a cul-de-sac or T dead end intersection may be
permitted. All land in excess of that needed for a temporary street, when extended, or the turnaround, shall be subject to a temporary easement.
(Easements for utilities shall be permanent unless the owner agrees to move any utilities installed within turnaround right of way.)
(k) Cul-De-Sac Streets: Cul-de-sac streets shall only be permitted where topographical or geographical features such as rivers, streams and cliffs
and such structures as railroads, interstate highways, etc., preclude continuation of streets. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall
be no longer than six hundred sixty (660) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a street property line diameter of at
least one hundred twenty (120) feet in the case of residential subdivision. The right of way width of the street leading to the turnaround shall be a
minimum of sixty six (66) feet. The property line at the intersection of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at a
radius of not less than twenty five (25) feet. A turnaround diameter greater than one hundred twenty (120) feet may be required by the plan
commission in the base of commercial or industrial subdivision if it is deemed necessary.
(l) Half Streets: Dedication of half streets is prohibited. Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half shall be platted and dedicated.
(m) Alleys: Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will normally not be required or permitted.
(n) Street Jogs: Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty five (125) feet shall not be permitted unless recommended by
the plan commission and/or approved by the village board.
(o) Easements: All easements shall be dimensioned and shall clearly show the purpose for which they were created, and shall be at least ten (10)
feet in width. Easements for utilities shall be provided along front, rear or side lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Evidence will be submitted that
the public utilities company concerned or village, as applicable, can satisfactorily serve with the utilities easements provided.
(p) Street Names: All newly platted streets shall be named and in a manner conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street
that is obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may logically be extended, although the various portions be at a
considerable distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall be recommended by the plan commission and
approved by the village board in order to avoid duplication or close similarity of names.
(q) Dedication: Streets will be dedicated by plat and improvements officially accepted by the village before the village will accept and assume
maintenance responsibilities.
(r) Private Streets: Private streets will not be allowed in a subdivision. (Ord., 4-11-1978)
