The term “displacement” shall include removal from city employment, reassignment to a former or other class pursuant to these rules, and reduction from full-time to part-time status.
    4. “City displacement re-employment list” means qualified full-time employees who are displaced may have their names placed on this list in order of total city seniority for the classes in which they previously held full-time status. This list will be used to fill vacant positions after exhausting the department displacement re-employment list and prior to the use of other employment lists.
    5. “Non-qualified full-time employee” means an employee with civil service status whose overall performance evaluation rating is below a satisfactory rating for the last two annual rating periods.
    6. “Recalled employee” means an employee who returns to city service from a re-employment list.
    7. “Qualified full-time employee” means an employee with civil service status whose last two annual performance evaluations was Satisfactory or higher. A qualified full-time employee who has been promoted or transferred and whose status is probationary or out-of-class shall, for the purpose of these displacement rules, be defined as a full-time employee of the department in which the currently-held position is allocated.
    8. “Seniority” means the length of total continuous, unbroken time worked for the city in a regular budgeted full-time position, regardless of a particular class or department. Continuous, unbroken time worked includes time during which the employee was absent with pay or was on approved long-term military leave. Approved leaves of absence without pay maintain the continuity of employment, but the duration of the leave is deducted from the total continuous time period. An employee who was in a full-time position and was displaced to a part-time position shall have the prior full-time service counted, as long as the employee is currently in a full-time position and there was not a break in continuous service.
C. Order of Displacements. Displacements in each class shall be made in the following order: first, temporary or part-time employees; second, probationary employees; third, full-time non-qualified employees; and fourth, qualified full-time employees.
    1. Seasonal employees may be hired to handle specific job functions that occur on a reasonable basis. Said positions do not have to be taken into consideration when determining displacement order. Seasonal employees shall not replace full-time positions; however, displaced employees shall be offered first opportunity for seasonal employment.
    2. When one or more probationary or full-time employees must be displaced within a department, those who are displaced shall be the employees with the least city seniority in the class affected.
    3. Where the displacement is limited to temporary or part-time employees, the department head, at the direction of the city manager or designee may determine which of the employees within the particular class shall be displaced.
    4. In the event two or more full-time employees have the same seniority, the person to be displaced shall be determined by lot.
    5. Qualified full-time employees so affected by the displacement procedures shall be re-hired in inverse order of total city seniority (last out, first in).
D. Seniority in Displacements. 
    1. Seniority in displacements shall be calculated as set forth in subsection B.8.
    2. A qualified full-time employee who receives a notice of displacement may displace a less senior employee in a lower class within the department, provided that the employee held the position within the lower class in the department, or the lower class is in the employees immediate job family as determined by the human resources manager. Where the lower class requires supervisory experience, the more senior employee must have supervisory experience prior to displacement to the lower level, or must have held such position in order to displace the less senior supervisory employee.
    3. The salary range of an employee displaced to a lower level shall be the salary range of that lower level.
    4. The employee will be placed at the step level of the lower class that is closest to their current salary without providing a raise.
    5. Any employee displaced to a lower class shall not be required to serve a probationary period.
E. Notice of Displacement. Notice of any displacement, under these rules, shall be made by giving a letter to the employees to be displaced a minimum of three days prior to the effective date of the displacement. The letter shall inform the employees of the appointing authority’s decision to reduce the work force. If any employee affected by the displacement cannot be located within twenty-four (24) hours after the effective date of displacement, the letter containing the displacement notice shall be mailed via certified mail, return receipt requested, to that employees last known address as shown on the employees records on file in the Personnel Office. Municipal code Section 2.84.310 shall apply as to severance pay.
F. Placement of Names on Re-employment Lists. On the date displacements become effective, the city manager shall order the names of displaced full-time and/or initial probationary employees to be placed on the re-employment lists established for all classes from which they were displaced.
G. Reversion to Former Status. When a reduction in the work force results in the displacement of an employee who had acquired full-time status in a former class, the employee shall, dependent upon his/her seniority, be reinstated to that former class. If the employees seniority is not sufficient to displace any employee in his/her former class, he/she shall be placed on the re-employment list for that class in addition to his/her current class. However, the employee must have continuous service with the city and may not have been removed from his/her former class for cause.
H. Use of Re-employment Lists. If, after a displacement occurs within a department, a position subsequently becomes available, the following method of filling the vacant position shall be used:
    1. The department head shall notify the manager of human resources of the vacant position to be filled. The manager of human resources shall certify the most senior individual eligible for re-employment to the position from the department displacement re-employment list and notify the eligible individual to contact the department head to arrange the date for filling the position.
    2. If the department displacement re-employment list is exhausted, the manager of human resources shall certify the three most senior eligible individuals from the city displacement re-employment list and shall notify those individuals to contact the department head for a job interview.
I. Rights of Employees Recalled from Displacements. An employee recalled from a city or department displacement re-employment list shall return to the same salary step held prior to displacement. The employee shall assume the same vacation accrual rate, vacation accrual date and increment seniority date (minus displacement period) as previously enjoyed in the class. All sick leave credits of record at the time of displacement shall be re-credited to the employee upon return to a full-time position within the class formerly held.
    1. Recalled full-time status employees from the department displacement re-employment list shall not be required to serve a probationary period; unless the employee was displaced during a probationary period, whereupon the remaining probationary time shall be served when recalled.
    2. Employees recalled from the city displacement re-employment list shall be required to serve a probationary period.
    3. If an employee fails probation as in number 2 above, he or she shall be removed from the city’s displacement list but shall be retained on the department displacement re-employment list.
J. Priority and Duration of Re-employment Lists. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the department displacement re-employment list and the city displacement re-employment list shall have precedence over all other employment lists.
    1. Displaced employees, in continuous service within the city, shall have the right to return to their former positions. However, they shall be required to maintain all job-required training, certification and licenses.
    2. The duration of affected employees rights to return to work through the department displacement re-employment list and the city displacement re-employment list shall be three years from the date of placement on such lists.
    3. If an employee desires re-instatement, he or she shall be required annually to notify, in writing, the manager of human resources of his or her intention. Prior to re-employment, said employee shall be required to demonstrate that he or she has maintained the required level of expertise or skills by passing any required entrance examinations, including, but not limited to, written, medical, agility or psychological testing as required by the department head.
    4. Also, it shall be incumbent upon all displaced employees to maintain all job-required training certification and licenses.
    5. Individual names shall be removed from the department displacement re-employment list and the city displacement re-employment list for any of the following reasons:
        a. Failure to accept employment or report to work, within fourteen working days after receipt of notice certifying eligibility for re-employment, in a similar position in the same class within the department from which the employee was displaced;
        b. Failure to notify the manager of human resources of any change in their address or telephone number within seven days of change;
        c. Failure to provide the manager of human resources with annual notification of intent to stay on the list;
        d. Failure to appear for a job interview after notification;
        e. Failure to respond, for any reason, within seven working days after posting by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a notice to the employee certifying eligibility for re-employment;

        g. Failure to accept employment or report to work for a position within a class listed by the employee on the city displacement re-employment form shall remove the employee’s name from the city displacement re-employment lists.
K. Appeal Procedure. Any displaced probationary or full-time employee may object to his or her displacement on grounds that the seniority calculation was incorrect or that the displacement action was the result of an improper or illegal employment practice. The employee may do so by filing an appeal within three days after being either personally served with a notice of displacement by the department head, or after receiving a certified or first-class letter informing him or her of the pending displacement.
    1. The city manager or designee shall determine the method of review and may conduct his or her own investigation, call witnesses, review documents, and/or proceed in the same manner it would for a hearing under these rules. After either a review or hearing, the city manager or designee shall make a final determination.
    2. If the employee who is displaced fails to make a timely appeal to his or her displacement, the displacement shall be effective as of the date specified in the notice of displacement. However, the city manager may correct an error in seniority calculations at any time and may make appropriate adjustments in an order of displacement or a priority list ranking due to the correction. (Ord. 4282 § 1, 2005; Ord. 4124 § 1, 2003; Ord. 3684 § 1, 1995; prior code § 3.14.220)

D. Right of Appeal. An employee shall have the right to appeal to the city manager, any disciplinary action, other than discharge, taken against him or her. Appeals must be in writing and must be filed with the city manager within five days of the action taken. Failure to appeal shall be held to be an admission of the validity of the disciplinary action.
E. Hearing. Upon receipt of an appeal, the city manager shall investigate the circumstances of the disciplinary action and set a date of hearing within ten days of receipt of appeal. An accused employee may designate a representative to speak in his or her behalf at the hearing.

The department head shall prepare written charges which shall be served on the suspended employee within thirty days of the notice of intent to file charges. The accused employee must answer these charges within ten days after being served.

B. Objective. Objective of grievance procedure shall be:
    1. To promote improved employee-employer relations by establishing grievance procedures on matters for which appeal or hearing is not provided by civil service board rules;
    2. To afford employees individually or through qualified employee organizations, a systematic means of obtaining further consideration of problems after every reasonable effort has failed to resolve them through discussions;
    3. To provide that grievances shall be settled as near as possible to the point of origin;
    4. Encouragement that grievances should be heard and settled as informally as possible.
C. Individual Informal Grievance Procedure. An employee who feels he or she has a grievance should attempt to resolve this grievance by discussion with his or her immediate supervisor without undue delay. If after such discussion, the employee does not feel the grievance has been satisfactorily resolved, he or she shall have the right to discuss the matter with the chain of command including his or her department head. Every effort should be made to resolve the grievance by informal means at the most immediate level of supervision. If the employee is not in agreement with the decision reached through such informal discussions, he or she shall have the right to file a request for a formal grievance in writing with his or her superior or department head. An informal grievance shall not be taken above the department head.
D. Individual Formal Grievance Procedure. After exhaustion of the informal grievance procedure, the grievance shall be put in writing and shall proceed on the following levels of review:
    1. Department or Division Review. The employee shall file his or her grievance in writing with his or her department head who shall discuss the grievance with the employee. The department head shall render his or her decision and comments to the employee in writing within fifteen calendar days. If the employee does not agree with the decision reached or if no answer is received from the department head within fifteen calendar days, he or she may present the grievance in writing to the city manager. Failure of the employee to take further action within ten calendar days after receipt of the decision or within a total of twenty-five calendar days if no decision is rendered, will constitute withdrawal of the grievance.
    2. City Manager Review. Upon receiving the grievance, the city manager or designated representative shall discuss the grievance with the employee and all other appropriate persons. The city manager may appoint a fact finding committee or an officer not in the normal line of supervision to investigate and advise him or her concerning the grievance. The city manager shall render a decision in writing to the employee within twenty calendar days after receiving the grievance. The decision of the city manager shall be final in all cases unless the grievance is subject to policy review by the city council. In such cases, the city manager shall then refer the matter to the appropriate council committee.
E. Employee Organization Grievance Procedures. 
    1. A recognized official of an employee organization may submit written grievances on behalf of the organization or an employee to the appropriate department head with a copy filed with the city manager;
    2. The department head shall render a written decision within fifteen calendar days within receipt of the written grievance unless a mutually agreed upon extension of time is set; a copy of the department head’s decision will be filed with the city manager;
    3. If the employee organization is not satisfied with the decision rendered by the department head, they may request a city manager review of the grievance within ten calendar days of receipt of the department head’s decision; failure of the employee organization to take further action within ten calendar days after receipt of the department head’s decision or within a total of twenty-five calendar days if no decision is rendered, will constitute withdrawal of the grievance; the city manager shall render his or her written decision within twenty calendar days after receiving the grievance; the city manager’s decision shall be final in all cases unless the grievance is subject to policy review of the city council; in such cases, the city manager shall refer the matter to the appropriate council committee.

2.72.320 Complaints against policemen.
A. Statement to Appointive Authority. Any person, other than the authority having the appointive power, believing that he or she has a grievance against any member of the police department, shall, before any formal complaint is filed with the civil service commission for the police department, present a verbal or written statement of such grievance to the authority having the appointive power of the person allegedly causing such grievance.
B. Investigation and Formal Complaint. Upon receipt of such statement, the appointive power shall at once investigate or cause to be investigated the allegations of the aggrieved, and if he or she finds sufficient grounds to substantiate the charges, shall file or permit to be filed by the aggrieved, a formal complaint against the accused with the civil service commission.
C. Report of Investigations. Should the appointive power find, upon investigation, that the charges against the accused are unfounded or untrue, or not within the jurisdiction of the civil service commission, no formal complaint shall be filed with the commission, and the appointive power shall inform the person claiming to be aggrieved of the results of his or her investigation and of his or her determination in the matter.
D. Filing of Complaints. In all other cases, complaints shall be filed by the appointive power. (Prior code § 3.14.310)

In order to differentiate leadmen, foremen and supervisory management employees, the allocation of classes to supervisory management categories for the purpose of assignment to supervisory management shall be contingent on meeting both of the following minimum criteria:

    7. A designation of those persons, not exceeding two in number, and their addresses, to whom notice sent by regular United States mail will be deemed sufficient notice on the employee organization for any purpose;
    8. A statement that the employee organization recognizes that the provisions of Section 923 of the Labor Code are not applicable to city employees;

    12. A request that the city’s designated authority recognize the employee organization as the majority representative of the employees in the unit claimed to be appropriate for the purpose of meeting and conferring in good faith on all matters within the scope of representation.

2.76.100 Appropriate unit.
A. The city’s designated authority, after reviewing the petition filed by an employee organization seeking formal exclusive recognition as majority representative, shall determine whether the proposed unit is an appropriate unit. The principal criterion in making this determination is whether the unit proposed contains the largest feasible group with a community of interest among such employees. The following factors, among others, are to be considered in making such determination:
    1. Which unit will assure employees the fullest freedom in the exercise of rights set forth under this chapter;
    2. The history of employee relations:
        a. In the unit,
        b. Among other employees of the city, and
        c. In similar public employment;
    3. The effect of the unit on the efficient operation of the city and sound employer-employee relations;
    4. The extent to which employees have common skills, working conditions, job duties or similar educational requirements;
    5. The effect on the existing classification structure of dividing a single classification among two or more units.
B. Provided, however, no unit shall be established solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized. (Prior code § 3.16.100)

2.76.110 Recognition of employee organizations as majority exclusive representative—Formal recognition.
A. Duties. The city’s designated authority shall:
    1. Determine the majority representative of city employees in an appropriate unit by arranging for a secret ballot election or by any other reasonable method which is based upon written proof, and is designed to ascertain the free choice of a majority of such employees; the employee organization found to represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit shall be granted formal recognition and is the only employee organization entitled to meet and confer in good faith in an effort to reach agreement on matters within the scope of representation for employees in such unit; this shall not preclude other recognized employee organizations, or individual employees, from consulting with management representatives on employer-employee relations’ matters of concern to them;
    2. Revoke the recognition rights of a majority representative, which has been found by secret ballot election no longer to be the majority representative subject to the limitations set forth in subsection B of this section.
B. Recognition Rights. The recognition rights of the majority representative designated in accordance with this section shall not be subject to challenge for a period of not less than twelve months following the date of such recognition.

For the purposes of Section 3508 of the Government Code, police officers of the city may form, join, participate in, and be represented by employee organizations of their own choosing for the purposes of representation on all matters of employer-employee relations as provided by this chapter, provided, such employee organizations:
    1. Are composed solely of such police officers;

    3. Are not subordinate to any other organization. (Prior code § 3.16.110)

    2. A determination by the city council after a hearing on the merits of the dispute;
    3. Any other dispute resolving procedures to which the parties mutually agree or which the city council may order.
B. Any party may initiate the impasse procedure by filing with the other party (or parties) affected a written request for an impasse meeting together with a statement of its position on all disputed issues.

    1. To permit a review of the position of all parties in a final effort to reach agreement on the disputed issues; and
    2. If agreement is not concluded, to mutually select the specific impasse procedure to which the dispute may be submitted; in the absence of agreement between the parties on this point, the matter may be referred to the city council.
C. The fees and expenses, if any, of mediators or of any other impasse procedure, shall be payable one-half by the city and one-half by the employee organization or employee organizations. (Ord. 4535 § 1, 2008; prior code § 3.16.130)

2.84.020 Salary plan.
The general basis for allocating a salary range of pay to a class or position is to provide “equal pay” for “equal work.” This applies to the relationship between jobs of comparable cities and those in the community, as well as to the internal relationships among city positions.
A. Administration. The city manager shall administer the step salary plan and from time to time make recommendations to the council of the city on the allocation of salary range to classes or positions. The city council shall set the salary range for each class or position within the city service.
B. Step Salary Plan. The step salary plan shall consist of a salary range for each class or position title as listed in the Schedule of Salaries and Related Benefits adopted by resolution of the city council. Each class or position salary shall include a salary range with five steps of rates of pay. The five steps within a class or position salary range shall be administered in the following way:
    1. Step One—First Step. The first step of each range is the beginning salary level and is the standard hiring rate for a class or position.
    2. Step Two—Second Step. Employees shall be advanced to step two after six months of satisfactory service in step one and after advancement is recommended by the department head and approved by the city manager.
    3. Step Three—Third Step. Employees may be advanced to step three of the salary range allocated to their class or position after a minimum time of one year of satisfactory work has been spent in step two, and after a recommendation has been made by the department head and approved by the city manager.
    4. Step Four—Merit. This step is reserved for employees who are considered to be fully qualified in their class and who maintain a consistent satisfactory standard of work performance. An employee may be advanced to step four after a minimum of one year’s service in step three, upon the recommendation of the department head with the approval of the city manager. An employee advanced to step four of the pay range shall retain such status so long as job performance remains at the level required to attain this step.
    5. Step Five—Merit. This step is to be considered a further and final step for employees who attain and maintain a thoroughly satisfactory standard of work performance. An employee may be advanced to step five after a minimum of one year’s service in step four, upon recommendation of the department head with the approval of the city manager. An employee advanced to step five of the pay range shall retain such status as long as job performance remains at the level required to attain this step.
    6. Y-rating—Positions Abolished. Employees who have had their position abolished and who are reallocated in city service in a different classification are considered to be Y-rated. Employees in step Y shall continue receiving the same rate of compensation until the rate of compensation of their new positions equals or exceeds their Y-rated salary or until the employee is appointed to a higher paying position, whichever shall occur first. The Y-rate shall not be applicable to layoffs.
C. Step Increases. No step increase shall be considered automatic or subject to increase by reason of time-in-service. All increases shall be based upon increased service value of the employee performance records, and must be recommended by the department head and approved by the city manager. Withholding recommendation for advancement to merit steps four and five shall not be considered a disciplinary action. All recommendations for salary step increases shall be submitted to the city manager for approval thirty calendar days before the effective date. Upon submission of satisfactory evidence and recommendation of the department head and the qualifications of the employee warrant, the city manager may authorize employment to any step. In computing length of service for step advancement purposes, service begins accruing from date of appointment to the position.
D. Merit Step Deferral. When an employee no longer meets the standards set for a merit step, the department head may recommend deferring a merit step increase. Such recommendation shall be made upon an Employee Performance Evaluation Form with a copy furnished to the employee of proposed deferral. If and when the employee’s performance has improved to the point that a merit step increase is justified, the department head shall initiate and forward Personnel Action Form to the human resources manager for approval.
E. Merit Step Reduction. When an employee no longer meets the standards set for a merit step, the department head may recommend withdrawal of the merit step increase. Such recommendation shall be made upon the Employee Performance Evaluation Form with a copy furnished to the employee sixty calendar days prior to the effective date of proposed reduction. Reevaluation of the withdrawal recommendation on an Employee Evaluation Form with a copy furnished to the employee shall be made by the department head thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of action. If the withdrawal recommendation is maintained and approved by the city manager, the employee shall be reduced by one merit step. Employees no longer meeting standards established may be reduced for all merit steps following the above procedure. Any employee reduced from a merit step shall again be eligible for advancement six months after effective date of reduction. (Ord. 4986 § 1, 2019; Ord. 4897 § 1, 2017; prior code § 3.18.020)

A. Upon the death of a member before retirement, the retirement system shall be liable for a death benefit which, if an amount is due under either subdivisions 3 or 4 of this subsection, and if there is a surviving wife or surviving children, shall be paid in monthly installments to the surviving wife and children as prescribed in this chapter, otherwise, the amounts due under subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection shall be paid as prescribed therein, and such death benefit shall consist of:
    1. His accumulated contributions, to be paid in a lump sum, to his widow, or, in the event there is no widow, to his child or children or, in the event there is no widow or child or children, to the beneficiary whom he nominates by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board, and in addition thereto;
    2. An amount equal to his compensation earnable during the six months immediately preceding his death to be paid in a lump sum to his widow or, in the event there is no widow to his child or children or, in the event there is no widow or child or children to his parent or parents whom the retirement board determines, to have been dependent, in whole or in part, upon such member; and, if the retirement board determines such death to be the result of injury or illness incurred while in the performance of duty, in addition thereto;
    3. An amount sufficient, when added to the amount provided in subdivision 1 of this subsection to provide an allowance equal to one-half of the member’s final compensation, payable as provided in Section 2.92.050. If payment of the allowance is terminated because of the marriage of the widow or attainment of the age of eighteen years by a child, before the total of the monthly payments made equals the sum of the amounts provided in subdivisions 1 and 2 of the subsection, then an amount equal to the difference between the total and the sum shall be paid in one amount to the married widow, or if there is no such widow, to the child or children of the deceased member. If the retirement board determines that death is not the result of injury or illness incurred in the performance of duty, and if the member is qualified for retirement from service under Section 2.92.240, then, in addition to the amounts provided in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection;
    4. An amount sufficient when added to the amount provided in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection, when applied according to rates and tables actuarially recommended and approved by the retirement board, to provide an allowance to be paid to the widow to whom the member was married at least one year prior to his death to be equal in amount to the allowance calculated as in Section 2.92.240, which would have been payable to her if the member had retired for disability at the time of his death and had died instantly thereafter, and to continue throughout her life or until her remarriage. If there is no such widow or if she dies before all surviving children of such deceased member have attained the age of eighteen years, then to his child or children until such child or children has attained the age of eighteen years. If payment of the allowance is terminated because of marriage of the widow or attainment of the age of eighteen years by such child or children before the total of the monthly payments made equals the sum or the amounts provided in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection, than an amount equal to the difference between the total and the sum shall be paid in one amount to the married widow, or if there is no such widow, to the child or children of the deceased member;
    5. A member or a beneficiary after the death of a member may, by written election duly executed and filed with the retirement board, have the death benefit, provided to be paid in a lump sum in this section, paid in monthly or annual installments subject to such rules and regulations as the board may adopt.
B. Should the service of a member be discontinued except by death or retirement, he shall be paid such part of his accumulated contributions as he demands; provided, if in the opinion of the retirement board, the member is permanently separated from the service, by reason of such discontinuance, he shall be paid forthwith all his accumulated contributions.
C. Any such member who again becomes a member of the system, shall redeposit in the retirement fund within a period of six months an amount equal to that which he withdrew. His rate of contribution for future years shall be the same as his rate prior to the termination of membership. (Prior code § 5.38.160)

2.92.270 Deferred retirement.
A. Should any member be separated from service of the fire department through any cause other than death or retirement, then all of the member’s contributions, with interest, shall be refunded to the member; provided, that if such member is entitled to be credited with at least ten years of service, the member shall have the right to elect within ninety days after the termination of service, whether to allow the member’s accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund. Such election shall become void upon such person’s employment in a position requisite for membership in this system, and may be revoked by such person at any time prior thereto. Upon such revocation, the member’s accumulated contributions shall be refunded to the member. Failure to make an election during the ninety-day period shall be deemed an irrevocable election to withdraw the member’s accumulated contributions.
B. A member whose membership continues under this section is subject to the same age requirement as applied to other members for service retirement but is not subject to a minimum service requirement. After the qualification of such member for retirement by reason of age for service retirement and only then, the member shall be entitled to receive a retirement allowance based upon the amount of the member’s accumulated contributions and service standing to the member’s credit at the time of retirement and on the employer contributions held for the member and calculated in the same manner as for other members. (Prior code § 5.38.162)

2.92.280 Reentry—Adjustment of contribution rate.

A. Bidding Required. Except as provided below or in Section 3.20.040, all contracts for the erection, improvement or repair of any public buildings or works, or in furnishing any supplies, equipment and materials for the same, or for any other use by the city, shall be by bid procedures pursuant to Sections 3.20.090 and 3.20.100.
B. Rejection of Bids. The city council may, in its discretion, reject any and all bids and may readvertise for bids.
C. Award of Bids. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all bids shall be awarded by the city council to the lowest responsible bidder submitting a responsive bid resulting in the lowest possible net cost to the city.
D. Bidding Exceptions. Bidding may be dispensed with pursuant to the procedures prescribed in this section and Section 136 of the City Charter.
    1. Projects for the erection and/or construction of all public buildings and works, and for furnishing any supplies and materials for the same, or for any other use by the city, and projects for the improvement, repair or maintenance of all public buildings and works, and for furnishing any supplies and materials for the same, the cost of which is forty thousand dollars or less, and contracts for the purchase of concrete, fuel and asphalt, the cost of which is seventy-five thousand dollars or less, may be performed by a city department or may be obtained in the open market pursuant to Section 3.20.100 of this title as determined by the city manager to best serve the needs of the city.
    2. When the city council, by resolution, determines that work, supplies, equipment or materials can only be reasonably obtained from one vendor because of restricted availability of such work, supplies, equipment or materials, or because of the necessity to successfully integrate such work, supplies, equipment or materials into an existing city project or system.
    3. When the city council, after rejecting bids, or if no bids are received, by a resolution adopted by at least four affirmative votes declares that, in its opinion, based on estimates supplied by the city manager, the work in question may be performed better or more economically by city employees or the supplies, equipment or materials may be purchased more economically on the open market.
    4. When the city council, by a resolution adopted by at least five affirmative votes containing a declaration of facts, deems work, supplies, equipment or materials to be of urgent necessity for the preservation of life, health or property.
    5. When the city council, by resolution establishes findings justifying an exception to the bidding process, and determining that work, supplies, equipment and materials can be best obtained through the design/build construction procurement process, then upon adoption of such resolution by the city council, the following design/build procurement process shall be used:
        a. When the city council authorizes the use of the design/build procurement process for a specific project, the director of public works may proceed pursuant to this section.
        b. For the purposes of this section design/build means a procurement process in which both the design and construction of a project are procured from a single entity.
        c. For the purposes of this section, design/build entity means a partnership, corporation, joint venture, or other legal entity that is able to provide appropriately licensed contracting, architectural and engineering services as needed.
        d. The selection criteria for the design/build competition shall be based upon performance, price and other criteria set forth by the public works department in the solicitation proposals. The department shall establish technical criteria and methodology, including price, to evaluate proposals, and shall describe the criteria and methodology in the request for design/build proposals. Criteria used in this evaluation of proposals may include, but need not be limited to, items such as proposed design approach, life cycle cost, project features and functions. The award shall be made to the design/build entity whose proposal is judged as meeting the best interest of the city and meeting the objectives of the project.
        e. Prior to contracting for the procurement under design/build, the public works director shall:
            i. Prepare a program setting forth the scope of the project that may include, but is not limited to, the size, type, and desired design character of the buildings and site, performance specifications covering the quality of the materials equipment and workmanship, or any other information deemed necessary to describe adequately the city’s needs. The performance specifications shall be prepared by a design professional duly licensed and registered in the state of California.
            ii. 
                (A) Establish a competitive selection process for design/build entities, including any subcontractors listed at the time of the submission, that clearly specifies the selection criteria, as well as recommends the manner in which the winning entity will be selected.
                (B) The public works director shall consider at least the following criteria in selecting a design/build entity:
                    (1) Possession of all required licenses, registration, and credentials in good standing that are required to design and construct the project;
                    (2) Submission of evidence that establishes the design/build entity members have completed, or demonstrated the capability to complete, projects of similar size, scope or complexity, and that proposed key personnel have sufficient experience and training to competently manage and complete the design and construction of the project;
                    (3) Submission of a proposed project management plan that establishes the design/build entity has the experience, competence and capacity needed to effectively complete the project;
                    (4) Submission of evidence that establishes the design/build entity has the capacity to obtain all required payment and performance bonding, liability insurance, and errors and omissions insurance, as well as a financial statement that assures the city the design/build entity has the capacity to complete the project;
                    (5) Provision for a declaration certifying that applying members of the design/build entity have not had a surety company finish work on any project within the last five years;
                    (6) Provision for information and a declaration providing details concerning at least the following:
                        (a) Any construction or design claim or litigation totaling more than five hundred thousand dollars or five percent of the annual value of work performed, which ever is less, settled or filed against any member of the design/build entity over the past five years,
                        (b) Serious violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as provided in Part 1 (commencing with Section 6300) Division 5 of the Labor Code, settled or filed against any member of the design/build entity,
                        (c) Violations of federal or state law, including, but not limited to, those laws governing the payment of wages, benefits, or personal income tax withholding, or Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) withholding requirements, State Disability Insurance withholding, or unemployment insurance payment requirements, settled or filed against any member of the design/build entity over the past five years,
                        (d) Information required by Section 10162 of the Public Contracts Code,
                        (e) Violation of the Contractor State License Law (Chapter 9) commencing with Section 7000 (a Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code), excluding alleged violations or complaints,
                        (f) Any criminal conviction or finding of liability or settlement in a civil action involving any member of the design/build entity of submitting a false or fraudulent claim to a public agency over the past five years,
                        (g) Provision for a declaration that the design/build entity will comply with all other provisions of law applicable to the project.
        f. The city council recognizes design/build entity is charged with performing both design and construction. Because a design/build contract may be awarded prior to the completion of a design, it is often impracticable for the design/build entity to list all subcontractors at the time of the award. As a result, a subcontractor listing requirement can create a conflict with the implementation of the design/build process by requiring all subcontractors to be listed at time when a sufficient set of plans may not be available. It is the intent of the city council to establish a clear process for the selection and award of subcontracts entered into pursuant to this section in a manner that maintains protection for subcontractors while enabling design/build projects to be administered in an efficient fashion. Therefore, the following requirements shall apply, at a minimum, to subcontractors, licensed pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 7000) of Division 3 of the Business and Professions Code, that are employed in design/build projects undertaken pursuant to this section:
            i. The public works department, and each design/build request for proposal, may identify types of subcontractors, by subcontractor license classification that will be listed by the design/build entity at the time of the submission of proposal. In selecting the subcontractors that will be licensed by the design/build entity, the public works department shall limit the identification to only those licensed classifications deemed essential for proper completion of the project. All subcontracts that were not listed by the design/build entity at the time of the submission of proposal shall be awarded in accordance with subsection (D)(5)(f)(ii) of this section.
            ii. All subcontracts that were not to be performed by the design/build entity in accordance with subsection (D)(5)(f)(i) of this section shall be competitively bid and awarded by the design/build entity in accordance with the design/build process set forth by the department in the design/build package.
        g. Any design/build entity that is selected to design and build a project pursuant to this section shall possess or obtain sufficient bonding as required by law. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a general or engineering contractor from being designated the lead entity on a design/build entity for the purposes of purchasing necessary bonding to cover the activities of the design/build entity.
    6. When the city council determines by resolution that work, supplies, equipment or materials are not available from local vendors and that it is in the best interests of the city, and to the city’s economic advantage that such work, supplies, equipment or materials be obtained at the lowest possible cost for the quality needed by entering into a city, county, state or federal government cooperative procurement contract that was competitively awarded by another governmental agency within the last thirty-six months.
    7. When a local vendor or company has successfully obtained a contract that was competitively awarded by another governmental agency within the last thirty-six months as a participant in a cooperative procurement contract, the city council may determine by resolution to dispense with bidding requirements for work, supplies, equipment or materials by participating in the cooperative procurement contract that was competitively awarded to the local vendor or company within the last thirty-six months. (Ord. 4860 § 1, 2016; Ord. 4285 § 1, 2005; Ord. 3914 § 1, 1999; Ord. 3863 § 1, 1998; Ord. 3749 § 1, 1997; Ord. 3616 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3214 § 1, 1989; prior code § 5.20.060)

No member shall have any direct involvement with the dispute between the bidder or contractor. Each member of the committee shall be appointed for one hearing only.
B. The dispute resolution committee shall hear issues referred by the city council. If the issue involves whether or not a contractor is a responsible bidder the committee may consider that a responsible bidder may include those contractors who have demonstrated the quality, fitness and capacity to perform under the terms and conditions of the contract including, but not limited to: a consistent record of timely performance on similar work in the past, proven financial resources, proven technical proficiency, and the committee may consider reviewing any past violations of law and regulations and past practices that resulted in additional costs to city. The dispute resolution committee shall take evidence only on the issue of the contractor’s quality of work and fitness and capacity to perform the contract as a responsible bidder. The city must show, by preponderance of the evidence, that the contractor is nonresponsible. When the issue involves a bid dispute, the committee shall receive evidence on the substance of the dispute in accordance with the rules set forth below and California law concerning the rights and responsibilities of bidders.
C. The hearing before the dispute resolution committee shall consist of a one-hour presentation by each side followed by a fifteen-minute closing presentation.

No other written material may be presented without the express authorization of the committee.
E. The dispute resolution committee shall issue a written advisory decision to the city council setting forth their decision and its basis. Such decision shall be transmitted to the city council for consideration at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting following the issuance of the written decision, subject to agenda deadlines. The advisory decision shall be reviewed by the city council who will then make the final decision. (Ord. 3860 § 1, 1998; Ord. 3759 § 1, 1997)

3.20.066 Pre-qualification of bidders.
A. The city manager, or designee, may at the city managers or designees discretion, authorize a pre-qualification screening for potential bidders on projects with an estimated value of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or more, or on any project where the city manager, or designee, determines special expertise, equipment or materials are required to properly complete the project.
B. All prospective bidders shall receive written notification within a reasonable period of time of the acceptance of their pre-qualification submittal or the disqualification of such submittal. Should a prospective bidder be disqualified in the pre-qualification process, that prospective bidder may appeal the decision to the city manager, or designee, upon written request setting forth the specific reasons for the appeal with the city clerk filed within seven working days of the mailing or delivery of the notice of disqualification. The city manager, or designee, shall hold a hearing within three working days of the filing of the notice of appeal and allow the appealing prospective bidder an opportunity to be heard on the disqualification. The appellant and city may present evidence, testimony and information relevant to the disqualification. The city manager or designee shall issue a written decision after the conclusion of the hearing and mail or cause to be delivered said decision to the appellant.
C. Should the prospective bidder be dissatisfied with the city managers or designees written decision the aggrieved bidder may appeal the same to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal setting forth the specific reasons for the appeal with the city clerk within five days of the mailing or delivery of the decision by the city manager, or designee. The city council shall hold a hearing on the disqualification within three weeks, or as soon thereafter as possible, of receipt of the notice of appeal. Pending the hearing before the city council, the decision of the city manager, or designee, shall remain in full force and effect. Should the decision of the city manager, or designee, be reversed or revised by the city council, the decision shall take effect as of the date of the city councils decision and shall not be retroactive.
D. The decision of the city council shall be final. Such decision shall be mailed or delivered to all parties.
E. To the extent allowed by law, the information submitted by prospective bidders shall remain confidential except on appeals to the city council where information used to decide the appeal will become public. (Ord. 4027 § 1, 2001)

3.20.068 Bid protests.
Bid protests shall be processed as follows:
A. Any protest concerning bids for a city project, or city purchase of supplies or materials, or the process followed by city for the award of such a contract must be made in writing on or before 4:00 p.m. on the day such matter comes before the city council for the contract to be awarded.
B. Upon receipt of such a protest, the finance director shall advise the city council of the facts and circumstances as are known to city surrounding the bidding process for that project.
C. The city council shall hear and determine the bid protest at the time the contract comes before the council for award of the project and before awarding the project; provided, however, the city council may by majority vote continue the matter to obtain additional information as the council deems necessary or may refer the protest to the dispute resolution committee for an advisory decision. The advisory decision of the dispute resolution committee shall be reviewed by the city council who will then make the final decision. (Ord. 3860 § 3, 1998; Ord. 2760 § 1, 1997)

3.20.070 Purchase orders.

(Prior code § 5.20.080)

3.20.090 Formal contract procedures.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the erection of any public building or works or in furnishing any supplies, equipment and materials for same or for any other use by the city with an estimated value greater than forty thousand dollars and contracts for the purchase of concrete, fuel and asphalt with an estimated value greater than seventy-five thousand dollars shall be by written contract or order with the lowest responsible bidder pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this section.
B. Notice inviting Bids. Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased and shall state where bid forms and specifications may be secured and the time and place for opening bids.
    1. Published Notice. Notices inviting bids shall be published at least five days before the date of the opening of the bids. Notices shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation published in the city.
    2. Bidders List. The finance department shall also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers whose names are on the bidders list or from responsible prospective suppliers who have made a written request that their names be added thereto.
    3. Bulletin Board. The finance department shall also advertise pending purchases by a notice posted on a public bulletin board in City Hall.
C. Bidders Security. Except when inviting bids for the sale of supplies, equipment, or materials, a bid bond in an amount equal to ten percent of the bid shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. When purchasing supplies, equipment, or materials, the finance director or designee at his or her discretion may prescribe in the public notices inviting bids an appropriate security deposit or other applicable bond in an amount not to exceed one hundred percent of the total bid price. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; provided, however, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his or her bid security upon his or her refusal or failure to execute the contract within ten days after the notice of award of contract has been mailed, unless in the latter event the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the contract. The city council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidders security shall be applied by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. If the city council rejects all other bids and readvertises, the amount of the lowest bidders security may be used to offset the cost of receiving new bids and any difference between that bidders bid and the price of the contract which is executed, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder.
D. Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the finance department and shall be identified as bids on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty calendar days after the bid opening.
E. Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may in its discretion accept the one it chooses.
F. Bonds. Except for work to be performed by city’s own work forces, the following bonds shall be procured. In every contract for the erection of any public building or works, or in furnishing any supplies, equipment and materials for same, the city shall require a faithful performance bond in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the contract price issued by an insurer admitted to transact the class of surety insurance in the state of California and rated B+7 or better by A.M. Best Rating Service or an equivalent nationally recognized rating service. In addition to the above performance bond, in every contract for the erection of any public building or works, or in furnishing any supplies, equipment and materials for same, unless otherwise required by law, the city shall require a faithful labor and materials bond (payment bond) in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the contract price issued by an insurer admitted to transact the class of surety insurance in the state of California and rated B+7 or better by A.M. Best Rating Service or an equivalent nationally recognized rating service.
G. Retention Percentage. In contracts for the erection, improvement or repair of any public building or work, the city shall retain a percentage of each progress payment as permitted by law; provided, however, on contracts of five hundred thousand dollars or more, once the work under the contract has been at least fifty percent completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer, the finance director may direct that the city withhold no additional retention or reduce the percentage retained from future progress payments.

B. Minimum Number of Quotes. Open market purchases shall, wherever possible, be based on at least three quotes.

B. The finance director shall have authority to require chemical and physical tests of samples submitted with bids and samples of deliveries which are necessary to determine their quality and conformance with specifications. (Prior code § 5.20.110)

3.20.120 Surplus supplies and equipment.
All department heads of the city shall submit to the finance director, at such times and in such form as he or she shall prescribe, reports showing stock, materials and equipment on hand not then in use in the department. When a surplus of stock, materials or equipment exists in any department, the finance director may transfer the same to any other department or departments having a need for such stock or any portion thereof on approval of the city manager. When it is found by the finance director that a surplus of stock, materials and/or equipment exists which is not needed for use by any city department, the city manager may authorize the sale thereof by the finance director, and the proceeds from any such sale or sales shall be deposited in the city treasury. Such sale or sales shall be conducted in any manner approved by city council or in the following manner:
A. Upon authorization of the city manager, the finance director shall obtain competitive and formal quotations for the sale of surplus stock, materials or equipment, when any one item or group of items offered for sale amounts to more than one thousand dollars in appraised resale value.
B. When items offered for sale amount to more than one thousand dollars in appraised resale value, the finance director shall cause notice of sale to be published at least five days before the sale, in the official newspaper, giving a general description of the items to be sold, where bids are to be received, and the time and place of sale. The finance director shall, in addition, solicit sealed quotations from prospective buyers, by telephone or by sending them copies of newspaper notices, or other methods designed to reach the greatest number of prospective buyers.
C. When any separate item or items of such surplus stock, material or equipment to be offered for sale amounts to one thousand dollars or less, the finance director may accept informal written bids or quotations for the sale of such item or items, without causing a notice of sale to be published in a newspaper.
D. At the time and place of sale of such surplus stock, material or equipment, oral bids may be considered by the finance director, after giving proper notice of such fact, provided such oral bids shall be at least ten percent higher than the highest written bid received at the time of opening of bids.
E. The finance director may, at his or her discretion, require cash or a cashiers check in an amount equal to ten percent of the price bid to be deposited by the bidder at the time of making or submitting his or her bid. The person to whom any bid is awarded shall consummate the purchase within five days from then, excluding the day of the award of such bid.
F. Whenever another governmental entity or a nonprofit organization having tax exempt status as determined under Section 501(c) Internal Revenue Code has requested the opportunity to purchase surplus stock, materials or equipment, the finance director may, without complying with other provisions of this section, negotiate with such governmental entity or nonprofit organization for the price to be charged for such surplus stock, materials or equipment. Any sale to a governmental entity or nonprofit organization shall be subject to confirmation and approval by the city council which, in its discretion, may authorize or reject such sale. If the sale is rejected, the property will be disposed of as surplus stock, materials or equipment as provided by the provisions of this chapter.
G. When surplus stock, material or equipment is unique (e.g., refuse truck, fire truck, street sweeper) and does not lend itself to disposal by the aforementioned procedures, the finance director may retain the services of an equipment broker to dispose of said surplus items if the use of said broker would, in the opinion of the finance director, allow the city to receive the maximum market value for the equipment. (Ord. 3590 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3373 § 1, 1991; Ord. 3114 § 1, 1987; Ord. 3055 § 1, 1986; Ord. 3006 § 6, 1985; prior code § 5.20.120)

3.20.125 Sale of surplus real property.
When it is found by the city manager that the city owns real property which is no longer needed by the city (except for property held in public trust), he shall report the property description and any other pertinent information to the city council which may authorize the sale thereof by the finance director and the proceeds from any such sale shall be deposited in the city treasury. Such sale shall be conducted either by competitive bids or by negotiated sale in the following manner:
A. Competitive Bids. The finance director shall obtain an appraisal on the real property to be sold, when such property exceeds four thousand dollars in value, and shall advertise for competitive and formal bids with a minimum bid of no less than ten percent below the appraised value. If the property is valued at less than four thousand dollars, then the finance director may accept informal bids. The highest bid shall be accepted for sale. At the time and place of such sale, oral bids may be considered by the finance director after giving proper notice of such fact, provided such oral bids shall be at least five percent higher than the highest written bid received at the time of opening of bids. The finance director may, at his discretion, require cash or cashiers check in an amount equal to ten percent of the bid price to be deposited by the bidder at the time of making or submitting his bid. The person to whom any bid is awarded shall consummate the sale and purchase within fifteen days from then, excluding the day of the award of such bid, unless otherwise provided by the finance director.
B. Negotiated Sale. The city council may authorize a negotiated sale of real property at or below the real property’s appraised value. (Ord. 3799 § 1, 1997; Ord. 3006 § 7, 1985; Ord. 2835 § 1, 1983)

The term of such leases shall not exceed two years.

C. The city manager or designee is authorized on behalf of the city to approve and execute agreements which have been approved as to form by the city attorney for the rooftop area of the city-owned parking structure located at the northwest corner of 18th and Eye Streets. The city manager or designee shall establish the terms and conditions of such agreements, except that fire marshal or designee shall set a maximum number of people which will be permitted to occupy the rooftop area, and such number shall be reflected on any application for rental, and the rental fee shall be set by a resolution of the City Council. (Ord. 3771 § 1, 1997; Ord. 3523 § 1, 1993; Ord. 3145 § 1, 1988; Ord. 3132 § 1, 1988)

All property in this city not exempt from taxation under the laws of the United States or the Constitution of the state, as the same now are or may hereafter be amended, is subject to taxation as provided in this section through Section 3.28.645; but nothing in this section through Section 3.28.645 shall be construed to require or permit double taxation. (Prior code § 6.04.010)

3.28.010 Corporate property—Shares of stock not taxable.
A. Shares of stock in corporation possess no intrinsic value over and above the actual value of the property of the corporation which they stand for and represent, and the assessment and taxation of such shares, and also of the corporate property, would be double taxation.
B. Therefore, all property belonging to corporations, excepting those exempt from municipal taxation as provided by the laws of the United States or the Constitution of the state, shall be assessed and taxed, but no assessment shall be made of shares of stock of any such corporation, nor shall any holder of any such stock be taxed therefor. (Prior code § 6.04.020)

3.28.015 Claims for exemptions—Affidavits.
A. Any person claiming property to be exempt from taxation shall make return thereof to the city assessor annually, the same as other property listed for taxation, and shall accompany the same by an affidavit, on forms to be furnished by or subject to the approval of the assessor, stating the facts under which said property is claimed to be exempt.
B. The assessor may, in his discretion, require other or additional proof of the facts stated by such affidavit, before allowing the exemption claimed.
C. Affidavits required for exemptions under the Constitution and Laws of the state as set forth in Division 1, Part 2, Chapter 1, Article 1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the state, shall be filed with the city assessor at the time and in the manner prescribed in Division 1, Part 2, Chapter 1, Article 2 of said Code.
D. Failure upon the part of the person claiming any such exemption to make affidavit or furnish evidence required in this chapter at the times specified in subsection C of this section, shall be deemed and treated as a waiver of such exemption by such person. (Prior code § 6.04.030)

C. Possessory interest means possession of, claim to, right to the possession of land or improvements, except when coupled with ownership of the land or improvements in the same person and taxable improvements on tax exempt land.
D. Real estate includes:
    1. The possession of, claim to, ownership of or right to the possession of land;
    2. Improvements.
E. Roll means the entire assessment roll, and includes all the pages and/or sheets of the assessment ledger prepared by the assessor describing all taxable property in the city. The secured roll is that part of the roll containing state-assessed property and property the taxes on which are a lien on real property, sufficient, in the opinion of the assessor, to secure the payment of taxes. The unsecured roll is that part of the roll containing property the taxes on which are not a lien on real property sufficient, in the opinion of the assessor, to secure the payment of taxes. The delinquent roll is that part of the roll containing property upon which taxes are delinquent.
F. Taxes include all taxes and annual installments of public improvement assessments charged on the respective tax rolls affected.
G. Unsecured personal property is property, the taxes on which are not a lien on real property, or when the real property is insufficient, in the opinion of the assessor, to secure the payment of taxes.
H. Value and full cash value mean the amount at which the property would be taken in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor. (Prior code § 6.04.040)

B. “Permanent resident” means any person who, as of a given date, has occupied or has had the right to occupy a room or rooms in a particular hotel, as defined in subsection A of this section, for the thirty consecutive days next preceding such date.
C. “Room rental” means the total charge made by any such hotel for lodging and/or lodging space furnished any such transient. If the charge made by such hotel to such transient includes any charge for services or accommodations in addition to that of lodging, and/or the use of lodging space, then such portion of the total charge as represents only room and/or lodging space rental shall be distinctly set out and billed on the transient by such hotel as a separate item.
D. “Tax collector” means the tax collector of the city of Bakersfield.
E. “Transient” means any person who, for any period of not more than thirty consecutive days, either at his or her own expense or at the expense of another, obtains lodging or the use of any lodging space in any hotel as defined in subsection A of this section, for which lodging or use of lodging space a charge is made. For purposes of this section only, “person” does not mean partnership, corporation or association of any nature whatsoever. (Ord. 4571 § 1, 2009; prior code § 6.12.010)

3.40.020 Tax imposed—Rate—Revenue measure.
A. There is imposed and levied on each and every transient a tax equivalent to twelve percent of the total amount paid for room rental by and for any such transient to any hotel; which tax shall be collected from the transient at the time and in the manner provided in Section 3.40.030.
B. The tax is levied for revenue purposes and is necessary for the usual financial operation of the city. (Ord. 4573 § 1, 2009; Ord. 3544 § 1, 1993; Ord. 3861 § 1, 1983; prior code § 6.12.020)

3.40.030 Collection of tax.
A. On and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, as amended, every person receiving any payment for room rental with respect to which a tax is levied under this chapter shall collect the amount of tax imposed from the transient on whom the same is levied or from the person paying for the room rental, at the time payment for the room rental is made.
B. Where the tax has been collected for room rental for thirty days or less and the occupant subsequently completes thirty-one consecutive days of occupancy, the person whose duty it is to collect the tax may return the tax to the occupant or person obligated to pay the tax.
C. If the person whose duty it is to collect the tax has paid the tax over to the city, he or she may, within one year from the date of the payment to the tax collector, and provided he or she has returned the tax to the occupant or person obligated to pay the tax, either take credit for the tax so paid on any subsequent return filed by him or her or file a claim for refund of the tax.

The relief granted pursuant to this section shall be limited to a declaration that the taxes assessed or collected or to be assessed or collected are unconstitutional or otherwise legally invalid.
This section shall not be interpreted to allow a taxpayer to postpone payment of transient lodging taxes pending the decision of the court. All assessment and collection provisions of Chapter 3.40 shall continue to apply to businesses affected by this section.
This section shall be applicable only in instances where the alleged illegal or unconstitutional assessment or collection occurs as the direct result of a change in administrative regulations or statutory or constitutional law that became effective not more than twelve months prior to the date the action is initiated by the taxpayer.

3.40.033 Refunds.
No refund of taxes paid pursuant to this chapter shall be required in whole or in part unless a written claim for refund is filed within one year of the date the tax was paid. (Ord. 3701 § 1, 1996)

3.40.080 Security requirements.
A. The tax collector, whenever he or she deems it necessary to insure compliance with this chapter, may require any person subject thereto, to place with him or her such security as the tax collector may determine.

The limitations provided in this chapter apply regardless of the type of security placed with the tax collector. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the tax collector subject to the limitations provided in this chapter.

A. Pay the principal of and interest on outstanding bonds issued to finance such project, as the same shall become due and payable;
B. Create and maintain reserves required or provided for in any resolution authorizing such bonds.

Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made.

I. General Provisions and Definitions

3.50.010 Title.
This chapter may be cited as the city of Bakersfield economic development revenue bond law. (Ord. 2737 § 1, 1982)

3.50.020 Purpose.
The council finds and declares that it is necessary and essential to the wellbeing of the city that it provide financial assistance to promote the economic development of the city. Such economic development will serve the following public purposes and municipal affairs of the city:
A. The full and gainful employment of residents of the city;
B. The full and efficient utilization and modernization of existing industrial, commercial, and business facilities;
C. The development of new industrial, commercial and business facilities;
D. The growth of the city’s tax base through increased property values and consumer purchasing;
E. The reduction of the need for and costs of welfare and other remedial programs;
F. The reduction of urban ills, such as crime, attributable in part to inadequate economic opportunities;
G. The stability and diversification of the city’s economy;
H. The lowering of the cost to city consumers of necessary goods and services;
I. The environmentally optimum disposition of waste materials of the city; and
J. The enhancement of the general economic prosperity, health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city.
The availability of the financial assistance authorized by this chapter will serve those purposes and the general plan of the city by providing private enterprises with new methods of financing capital outlays in the city and by ensuring that economic development within the city will reflect the local community’s needs and objectives and will be environmentally optimum with respect to both the physical and social environment of the city. The city shall promote such public interests pursuant to this chapter without adversely affecting areas outside the city and without conflicting with efforts by the state to solve problems of statewide concern.

3.60.020 Purpose.
The council finds and declares that it is necessary, essential, a public purpose and a municipal affair for the city to be authorized to provide financing to health institutions that provide essential services to residents of the city in order to aid such health institutions in containing costs and thereby to enable such health institutions to establish lower rates and charges than would otherwise prevail and to provide better service at such rates and charges. Unless the city intervenes to provide such financing, such rates and charges may increase at an ever accelerated pace because such health institutions cannot obtain financing at equivalent cost from private sources. (Ord. 2871 § 1(102), 1983)

Cost shall include such costs which under generally accepted principles are properly chargeable to a capital account (whether or not actually so charged), structures, real or personal property, franchises, rights and interests acquired or used in connection with a health facility, the cost of demolishing or removing any structures (including the cost of acquiring any lands to which such structures may be moved), the cost of engineering, architectural, financial and legal services, plans, specifications, studies, surveys, estimates, administration expenses or other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility of or to acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating, improving or financing a health facility, including all costs of issuance of bonds for such purposes, reserves for debt service and for repairs, replacements, additions and improvements, and capitalized bond interest for such period as the city may determine.
D. Council means the city council of the city of Bakersfield.
E. Health facility means any facility, place or building which is maintained and operated for the diagnosis, care, prevention and treatment of human illness, physical or mental, including convalescence, rehabilitation and care during and after pregnancy, or for any one or more of these services, and which provides and will continue providing to residents of the city essential health care services designated as such in an agreement between the city and the participating health institution providing or operating such facility, place or building.
Health facility includes a portion of one of the above types of facilities and includes the following facilities if operated in conjunction with one of the above types of facilities: a laboratory, a laundry, a nurses’ or interns’ residence, a housing facility for patients, staff or employees and the families of any of them, an administration building, a research, maintenance, storage, utility or parking facility and all real and personal property, land, buildings, structures, facilities, equipment, fixtures and furnishings (including, without limitation, medical office buildings, skilled nursing facilities, adult day care centers and bloodbanks) related to any of the foregoing or required or useful for the operation of a health facility.
Health facility shall not include any facility, place or building used or to be used primarily for sectarian instruction or study or as a place for devotional activities or religious worship.
F. Participating health institution means a private corporation or association authorized by the laws of the state:
    1. To acquire a membership in a nonprofit corporation which owns or operated a health facility as defined in this chapter directly from that nonprofit corporation or to provide or operate a health facility as defined in this chapter; and
    2. Which, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, undertakes the financing of the acquisition of such membership, or the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation or improvement of a health facility or undertakes the refunding or refinancing of obligations incurred to finance the acquisition of such membership, or of a health facility.
G. Revenues means amounts received by the city as repayment of principal, interest, and all other charges with respect to a loan, lease, sublease or sale agreement under this chapter, any proceeds received by the city from mortgage, hazard or other insurance on or with respect to rents, charges, fees, income and receipts derived by the city from the financing of a health facility under this chapter, any amounts received by the city as investment earnings on moneys deposited in any fund or account securing bonds, and such other moneys as the council may, in its discretion, lawfully designate as revenues.

B. The city may sell or lease, upon such terms and conditions as the city shall deem proper, to a participating health institution any health facility owned by the city under this chapter, including a health facility conveyed to the city in connection with a financing under this chapter but not being financed or refinanced under this chapter.

Based on the biennial review or audit, a revised Master Fee Schedule shall be submitted to the city council for consideration in order to allow the city to recover the cost reasonably incurred to provide each regulation, product, or service identified in the Master Fee Schedule.
B. Nothing stated in subsection A herein shall prevent city staff from recommending or the city council from adopting a revised Master Fee Schedule more often then biennially if it is determined, in the judgment of the city manager, that a gross inequity would result by not revising the Master Fee Schedule prior to the biennial review or audit thereof.

3.70.040 Procedure for setting fees.

C. The collector shall not issue to any such person another business tax certificate for the same or any other business, until such person has furnished and paid the business tax as required in this chapter. (Ord. 3371 § 1, 1991)

8.30.010     Findings—Deemed nuisance when.

8.30.030     Distribution not prohibited.

8.30.010 Findings—Deemed nuisance when.
A. The city council finds and determines that the distribution of unsolicited printed matter upon residential property can be a nuisance and that the distribution of such unsolicited printed matter may, if not handled reasonably, constitute an annoyance and an invasion of privacy.
B. The city council further finds and determines that printed matter that is indiscriminately distributed upon residential property when it is not requested by the owner, can be a source of litter and debris in the community.
C. The city council further finds and determines that the distribution of printed matter upon residential property, except in compliance with the requirements of Section 8.30.030, constitutes a public nuisance. (Ord. 3070 § 3, 1986)

8.30.020 Unsolicited littering prohibited.
No person shall throw, distribute, deposit, place or attach or in any other way leave any handbill, circular, newspaper, paper, booklet, poster or any other printed matter on residential property, solicit or hire any person to do so, except in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.30.030. (Ord. 3070 § 3, 1986)

8.30.030 Distribution not prohibited.
Distribution of unsolicited printed matter upon residential property is not prohibited by Section 8.30.020 if the printed matter is placed within the outer (screen or storm) door of any residence, enclosed in a transparent plastic sleeve and attached to the handle of such door, or printed matter fastened over the doorknob of such outer door, without knocking or ringing the door bell or if the printed matter is handed to a resident of the property.

Chapter 8.31 PLACEMENT OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS ON PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLES

Sections:
8.31.010     Findings.
8.31.020     Placement of printed matter in or upon motor vehicles prohibited.
8.31.030     Distribution of printed matter by personal delivery.
8.31.040     Solicitation of petition signatures excepted.

8.31.010 Findings.
The city council finds:
A. The unsolicited placement of advertising material, political advertising, religious material and any other printed matter in or upon motor vehicles without the knowledge and consent of the owner, constitutes a nuisance and is a source of substantial litter and debris within the community.
B. A substantial amount of such printed matter is not wanted by the owner of the motor vehicle and, when the owner returns to his motor vehicle, the printed material is removed from the motor vehicle and cast aside upon either public or private property. The additional debris on public or private property is a source of public and private annoyance, cost, additional funds to supervise and police, and is a source of refuse for rodents, insects and other vermin, and is not aesthetically pleasing or compatible with surrounding property, especially in instances where the adjacent property owner is attempting to police his or her property.
C. The city is attempting to control costs of public street-sweeping and other costs incidental to the control of waste and debris, and is also attempting to educate and encourage private citizens to participate in waste management.
D. The city has no intention or desire to interfere with rights of a citizen to petition the government, or to freely advocate ideas and proposals under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The city council finds that First Amendment rights can be exercised in a manner consistent with this chapter, in that no restriction is placed on the distribution of printed material that is personally handed or personally delivered to the public so that the recipient of the material personally accepts it from the distributor. Under such circumstances, the city council finds that less litter and debris will result in the city, since some members of the public, not interested in the material, will refuse it and other members of the public who accept the material personally, presumably will do so because they desire to read it and will later dispose of it in a proper receptacle. (Ord. 3070 § 4, 1986)

8.31.020 Placement of printed matter in or upon motor vehicles prohibited.
The placement of printed matter upon motor vehicles located in public streets, public parks, public or private parking lots, private shopping centers and other public or private sites and the soliciting or hiring of any person to do so is prohibited. (Ord. 3070 § 4, 1986)

8.31.030 Distribution of printed matter by personal delivery.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the distribution of printed matter by personal delivery or by handing the material directly to the recipient thereof. (Ord. 3070 § 4, 1986)

8.31.040 Solicitation of petition signatures excepted.
Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the personal solicitation of signatures to a petition to redress grievances addressed to any governmental agency nor the distribution of any printed material which accompanies the solicitation provided the solicitations are made in person and the printed material that is given is personally handed to the person whose signature or whose support is being solicited. (Ord. 3070 § 4, 1986)

This ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as “tobacco use prevention”. (Ord. 4017 § 1, 2001)

8.58.020 Findings and purpose.
The city council finds that the smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a positive danger to health and a material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort and a health hazard to those who are present in confined spaces, and that smoking rates are on the increase among the youth population of Kern County. In addition, the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have concluded that second-hand smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease in healthy non-smokers. In order to promote public health, safety and welfare, the declared purposes of this chapter are to prohibit the smoking of tobacco, or any weed or plant, in public places and places of employment, to protect the public health by restricting public exposure to second-hand smoke, and to restrict youth access to tobacco products, as stated and required in this chapter. (Ord. 4017 § 1, 2001)

8.58.030 Definitions.
As used in this chapter only, the following words and phrases are defined as such:
A. “Cigar lounge” means a private smokers’ lounge of an enclosed area in or attached to a retail or wholesale tobacco shop that is dedicated to the use of tobacco products, including but not limited to cigars and pipes.
B. “Tobacco product” means any manufactured substance made from the tobacco plant, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco and smokeless tobacco, or products prepared from tobacco and designed for smoking or ingestion.
C. “Tobacco shop” means a business establishment whose main purpose is the sale of tobacco products, including but not limited to cigars, pipe tobacco and smoking accessories.
D. “Vendor-assisted sale” means a purchase requiring a direct, face-to-face exchange between the retailer and the customer, in which the vendor has access to the tobacco product, and assists the customer by supplying the product. The customer does not take possession of the product until it is purchased. (Ord. 4017 § 1, 2001)

8.58.040 Requirement of vendor-assisted sales.
It shall be unlawful for any person or business to sell, permit to be sold, or offer for sale any tobacco product by means of a self-service display, cigarette vending machine, or by any means other than vendor-assisted sales. This prohibition shall not apply to tobacco shops and cigar lounges. A “self-service display” is the open display of tobacco products which the public has access to without the intervention of a store employee, including but not limited to a rack, shelf or counter-top display. (Ord. 4017 § 1, 2001)

8.58.050 Purchaser identification.
The seller of any tobacco products shall require photographic identification if a purchaser reasonably appears to be under twenty-seven years of age. In compliance with state law, tobacco products shall not be sold to, possessed, used, or purchased by anyone under twenty-one years of age. (Ord. 4937 § 1, 2018; Ord. 4017 § 1, 2001)

B. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to place, erect or maintain any such encroachment as defined in Section 12.20.010 shall make application for a permit at the office of the city engineer. Such application shall contain the name and address of the applicant, a description of the proposed encroachment and the proposed location thereof, the period of time for which such encroachment is proposed to be maintained, and such other information as may be required by the city engineer. Such application shall further contain an agreement on the part of the applicant that if such application is granted, the applicant will indemnify and save and hold harmless the city, its agents, officers and employees against and from all damages, judgments, claims, demands, expenses, costs and expenditures, and against all loss or liability which the city or such officers, agents or employees may suffer, or which may be recovered from or obtainable against the city or such officers, agents or employees, legally caused by, growing out of, or in any way connected with, the placing, erection or maintenance of such encroachment, and upon the expiration of such permit or the revocation thereof, the applicant will, at his or her own cost and expense, remove the same from the public property or right-of-way where the same is located and restore such public property or right-of-way to the condition as nearly as that in which it was before the placing, erection, maintenance or existence of such encroachment.

Also, if determined by the advisory agency that improvement by an applicant would benefit the development expediently and effectively, the advisory agency shall have the authority to require improvement, payment of fee in-lieu, or combination thereof with approval of the said development permit, for the purpose of improving public trails pursuant to this chapter and the adopted Specific Trails Plan. If the advisory agency does not make such determination at the time of approval of the development, then the development shall be subject to pay the fee in-lieu of improvement pursuant to this chapter, at the time no later than issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.040 Requirements.
At the time of approval of a development, the advisory agency shall determine, pursuant to this chapter, the land required for dedication, reservation, improvement, in-lieu fee payment and/or combination thereof. As a condition of approval of a development, the applicant shall dedicate, reserve land, improve, pay a fee in-lieu, or a combination thereof, at the option of the advisory agency, for trail purposes, and reserve land for support facilities, if appropriate, according to the formulas contained in this chapter and standards of the Specific Trails Plan. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.050 Standard.
A. It is hereby found and determined the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety for the benefit of persons residing in the city as a result of proposed development require land devoted to trails and support facilities, as adopted by a Specific Trails Plan.
B. All new residential dwelling developments within the city shall be subject to this chapter, except as indicated in Section 12.64.180.
C. The amount of dedication, improvement, or fees paid is based upon the formulas set forth in this chapter, which shall be determined on the basis of the standard for each phase of the Specific Trails Plan. A resolution shall be adopted for each phase which establishes the amount of fee for each phase.
D. Commercial, industrial and non-residential developments shall be required to reserve trails and support facilities that are located on said property. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.060 Requirements for dedication.
A. Lands to be dedicated or reserved for trail or reserved for support facility purposes shall be suitable, in the opinion of the advisory agency in location, topography, environmental characteristics, development potential, and consistent with the Specific Trails Plan as it refers to the intended use. The primary intent of this section shall be construed to provide the land for functional trails and support facilities for community service.
B. At the time of approval of a development as defined in this chapter, the advisory agency shall determine the amount of land required for dedication. If the advisory agency requires in-lieu payment by the applicant, the advisory agency will set the rate or amount of land upon which the in-lieu fee will be based.
C. Prior to, or concurrently with, final approval of a development project, the applicant shall dedicate the land free of encumbrances to the city, and/or pay in-lieu fees, as required by the advisory agency. Where advisory agency has determined that fees shall be paid in-lieu of, or in addition to the dedication of land, the in-lieu fees shall be set based on the land dedication requirements pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.070 Formula for dedication of land.
A. The applicant shall dedicate land so that a trail and its development shall be sufficient in size, topography and design that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the developments and be consistent with the policies of the Specific Trails Plan.
B. The proportional amount of land for trails to be required for each residential development shall be calculated pursuant to the following Formula A:
+--------------------------+---+---------------------------+---+-----------------------+
| Number of Dwelling Units | X | Phase Standard for Trails | = | Amount Square Feet of |
|                          |   | by Type of Dwelling       |   | Trail Dedication      |
|                          |   | Unit                      |   |                       |
+--------------------------+---+---------------------------+---+-----------------------+
C. For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling units for property designated for residential development on the Metropolitan Bakersfield 2010 General Plan shall be based on densities as described for each phase of the Specific Trails Plan. All subdivisions adding residential units and subsequent development of additional units shall require payment of in-lieu fees and/or dedication of land pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.080 Formula for fee in-lieu of dedication.
A. When a fee is to be paid in-lieu of land dedication, the applicant shall, in-lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section 12.64.070. The fee for land shall be paid prior to or contemporaneously with recordation of a final map, issuance of a permit or approval of any application as defined as a “development” project. The total amount may be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The amount of in-lieu fee shall be determined in accordance with the following Formula B:
+--------------------+---+------------------+---+------------------+---+-----------+
| Number of Dwelling | X | Phase Standard   | X | Fair Market      | = | Amount    |
| Units              |   | for Trail by     |   | Value of         |   | of        |
|                    |   | Type of Dwelling |   | Land (per Square |   | In-Lieu   |
|                    |   | Unit             |   | Foot)            |   | Fee       |
|                    |   |                  |   |                  |   | Required  |
|                    |   |                  |   |                  |   | for Trail |
+--------------------+---+------------------+---+------------------+---+-----------+
B. Said in-lieu fee collected and accrued interest shall be used primarily to acquire necessary trails. The second priority of said monies shall be to improve and enhance trail facilities for said phase as shown in the Specific Trails Plan. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.090 Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee.
A. When a portion of a trail is located within land to be developed, and such portion is less than the amount of dedication required pursuant to Section 12.64.070, applicant shall dedicate said portion of trail, and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.64.080 shall be paid for the value of any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 12.64.070. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.100 Determination of fair market value.
A. The fair market value of land to be dedicated or of the property on which in-lieu fees are to be paid shall be determined by a written appraisal report in accordance with Section 15.80.100 of the Bakersfield Municipal Code; except as follows;
B. In the case where a trail serving a phase, has been acquired by the city prior to said development, the planning director has determined that said acquisition has not or does not satisfy another development’s requirements pursuant to this chapter, then, the determination of the “fair market value” used in the formula herein is defined as the purchase or acquisition price paid by the city for said real property on which the trail is located. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.110 Formula for fee in-lieu of trail improvement.
A. When a fee is to be paid in-lieu of improvement, the applicant shall, in-lieu of improving trail, pay a fee equal to the value of improving the amount of land as calculated pursuant to Section 12.64.070. The fee for improvement shall be paid prior to or contemporaneously with issuance of a building permit for a residential dwelling unit. The total amount may be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The amount of in-lieu fee shall be determined in accordance with the following Formula C:
+--------------------------+---+------------------------+---+-------------------------+
| Phase Standard for Trail | X | Trail Improvement Cost | = | Amount of Improvement   |
| per Type of Dwelling     |   | per Square Foot        |   | Fee Required for Trails |
| Unit                     |   |                        |   | per Dwelling Unit       |
+--------------------------+---+------------------------+---+-------------------------+
B. The city engineer shall establish, and from time to time, may review and revise the construction and improvement costs of trails used in Formula C in order to make cost adjustments due to inflation, updated labor and material costs, revision of design standard, or other related factors. The city engineer shall keep this cost information on file in his office available for public inspection
C. The in-lieu fee collected and any accrued interest shall be used primarily for the purpose of constructing and improving trails. Construction and improvement of trails may be combined with the construction of parks serving the planning area to provide for an integrated recreational facility. Secondarily, the in-lieu fee may be used to acquire trail facilities. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.120 Credit.
An applicant may make written request to the city for credit of trails and/or support facilities and/or improvements to be applied to future development projects within the phase planning area by providing all or a portion of trails, support facilities and/or improvements. Said request shall be in accordance with the guidelines and policies stated in the Specific Trails Plan. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.130 Disposition of fees.
A. Fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the city treasurer and shall be deposited in a special fund. Money in said fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for the purposes enumerated in this chapter.
B. Disposition of collected fees shall be subject to the provisions of Section 66001, or its successor section, of the Government Code.
C. The finance director, or designee, shall render reports to the city council annually by including in the fiscal year budget or other annual report the amount of fees received, the commitment of fees and fund balance. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.140 Sale of dedicated land.
If, during the ensuing time between dedication or acquisition of land for Specific Trails Plan purposes and commencement of first stage or development, circumstances arise which indicate another site would be more suitable for trail purposes serving the phase planning area, the land may be sold or traded for other land upon the approval of the city council, after recommendation from the planning commission. The resultant funds from a sale shall be used for purchase and development of a more suitable trail facility. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.150 Exemptions.
The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:
A. Reconstruction, rehabilitation, remodel or replacement of a residential dwelling unit, provided that replacement structure is the same type of unit, does not create additional residential units, and is substantially the same size as the structure it replaces.
B. A development for which requirements for trail and support facilities pursuant to this chapter have been previously met, and evidence acceptable to the advisory agency is provided by the applicant. However, subsequent development of land may require additional dedication, improvement and/or in-lieu fees as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

12.64.160 Appeals.
The determination of the advisory agency pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to appeal procedures to the city council set forth in Chapter 16.52. (Ord. 3713 § 1, 1996)

If this bill is not paid within fifteen (15) days after presentation, service may be liable to discontinuance. A cash deposit and a reconnection fee may be required to reestablish service.
Should the amount of this bill be questioned, an explanation should be requested from the city. If an explanation satisfactory to the customer is not made by the city and the bill is still questioned, the customer may deposit with the City of Bakersfield, City Treasurer, 1600 Truxtun Avenue, Bakersfield, California 93301, the amount of the bill to avoid discontinuance of service. Make remittance payable to City of Bakersfield and attach the bill and a statement setting forth the basis for the dispute of the amount of the bill.

    1. Upon discontinuance of service, the city will refund the customer’s deposit or the balance thereof in excess of unpaid bills for that service.
    2. After the customer has, during the period of time the deposit is held or for twelve consecutive months, paid all bills for service, within fifteen days after presentation, the city will refund the deposit.

A. Notices to Customers. Notices from the city to a customer normally will be given in writing, either delivered to him or her, mailed to his last-known address, or by leaving such notice in a conspicuous place at the customer’s premises. Where conditions warrant and in emergencies, the city may resort to verbal notices given by telephone or in person.
B. Notices from Customers. Notices from a customer to the city may be given by him or her or his or her authorized representative verbally or in writing at the city’s operating office or to an employee of the city or its agent duly authorized to receive notices or complaints, or may be sent by mail to the city’s operating office. (Prior code § 1.46.080)

14.04.090 Rendering and payment of bills.
A. Rendering of Bills. 
    1. Billing Period. Bills for water service will be rendered monthly unless otherwise provided in the rate schedules.
    2. Metered Service. Meters will be read at regular intervals for the preparation of regular bills and as required for the preparation of opening bills, closing bills, and special bills. Each meter on a customer’s premises will be considered separately, and the readings of two or more meters will not be combined except where combination of meter reading is specifically provided for in a rate schedule, or where the city’s operating convenience or necessity may require the use of more than one meter, or a battery of meters. In this case, the monthly minimum charge will be computed upon the resultant diameter of the total combined discharge areas of such meters.

C. Failure to Make Deposit. Failure of the customer to deposit the amount of any bill in question within fifteen days after the date upon which the notice mentioned in subsection B of this section is given by the city will warrant discontinuance of service without further notice. (Ord. 4564 § 2, 2009; prior code § 1.46.100)

14.04.110 Conditions for discontinuance—Restoration of service—Fees.
A. Nonpayment of Bills. 
    1. A customer’s water service may be discontinued for nonpayment of a bill for water service furnished if the bill is not paid within fifteen days after presentation. A customer’s service, however, will not be discontinued until the amount of the deposit made to establish credit for that service has been fully absorbed.
    2. A customer’s water service may be discontinued for nonpayment of bill for water service furnished at a previous or different location served by the city if the bill is not paid within thirty days after presentation at the new location. Residential service will not, however, be discontinued for nonpayment of bills for separate nonresidential service.
    3. No service will be discontinued under this section until after at least five days’ written notice to the customer of the city’s intention.
B. Unsafe Apparatus. The city may discontinue service, without notice, to any premises where apparatus, appliances or equipment using water is, in the opinion of the city or Department of Public Health, found to be dangerous or unsafe. The city shall notify the customer promptly of the reasons for the discontinuance and the corrective action to be taken by the customer before service can be restored.
C. Service Detrimental to Other Customers. The city may discontinue service without notice to any premises where the use of water thereon by apparatus, appliances, equipment or otherwise is found by the city to be detrimental or injurious to the water service furnished to other customers. Notification to the customer shall be made as provided in subsection B of this section.
D. Fraud and Abuse. The city may discontinue water service without notice to any customer when it is discovered the customer has obtained water service by fraudulent means, or has diverted the water service for unauthorized use. The city shall not restore service until the customer has complied with all filed rules and requirements of the city and the city has been reimbursed for the full amount of the service rendered and the actual cost to the city incurred by reason of such fraudulent use.
E. Noncompliance. The city may, unless otherwise provided, discontinue water service to a customer for noncompliance with any of the sections of this chapter if the customer fails to comply therewith, within five days after receiving written notice of intention to discontinue service.
F. Customer’s Request for Service Discontinuance. A customer may have his or her water service discontinued by giving notice to the city or one of its authorized agents of his or her desire, not less than two days before its effective date. He or she will be required to pay all water charges until the effective date stated in such notice. Where such notice is not given, the customer will be required to pay for water service until two days after the city has knowledge that the customer has vacated the premises or otherwise has discontinued water service.
G. Restoration-Reconnection Charge. When water service has been discontinued for noncompliance with a section of this code, a restoration-reconnection fee will be assessed as set by the city council. (Ord. 3939 § 5, 1999; Ord. 3783 § 4, 1997; Ord. 3604 § 1, 1994; prior code § 1.46.110)

14.04.120 Rates and fees.
A. Monthly Rates and Fees. The city water board, with concurrence of the city council, shall establish monthly rates and fees for water usage. The monthly fee consists of two components: the “readiness to serve fee” which is a flat rate for all customers based on the size of connection and a “quantity unit rates” based on the quantity of water used. A complete schedule of all rates and fees authorized to be charged for water service shall be kept in the city’s local offices where they will be available for public inspection.
B. Availability Fees. The city water board, with concurrence of the city council, shall establish availability fees for water service facilities required to enable development of all areas served by the city water system except those described in Exhibit C-1 of the City Agreement No. 76-36. Such fees are declared to be necessary to compensate the city for the expense incurred in furnishing source, storage, and water distribution facilities, and related capital project expenses, including, but not limited to, costs of acquisition and financing and necessary costs of operation, maintenance, replacement, improvement and extension of the water system.
Each fiscal year, the water department shall submit to the water board a proposed availability fee schedule. The availability fee shall be adjusted annually by the Construction Cost Index defined in Bakersfield Municipal Code Section 15.84.030. Also, the fee schedule shall be further adjusted to reflect all city expenses incurred as set forth in the previous paragraph. The fee shall be adopted by resolution of the city council following a noticed public hearing.
C. All applicants for service where availability fees are to be paid shall sign a domestic water service contract. The required fee must be paid at the first occurrence of either the issuance of a building permit or the recordation of a final map. No final map allowing construction shall be recorded nor any building permit issued prior to payment of proper fees for water service. (Ord. 4732 § 1, 2013; Ord. 4344 § 1, 2006; Ord. 3504 § 3, 1992; Ord. 2660 § 3, 1981; prior code § 1.46.120)

14.04.130 Temporary service.
“Temporary service” is defined to refer to service for use considered by the city to be nonpermanent or of limited duration, or to be a use by a venture or enterprise of speculative character or of questionable permanency.
A. Establishment of Temporary Service. The city will, if in its opinion no undue hardship to its existing customers will result therefrom, furnish temporary service under the following conditions:
    1. The applicant will be required to pay to the city, in advance, the estimated net cost of installing and removing the facilities necessary to furnish the service.
    2. Where the duration of service is to be less than one month, the applicant may also be required to deposit a sum of money equal to the estimated bill, subject to adjustment and refund or repayment in accordance with the actual bill due upon discontinuance of service.
    3. Where the duration of service is to exceed one month, the applicant may also be required to establish his or her credit in the manner prescribed for permanent service.
B. Change to Permanent Status. In the event a temporary service becomes permanent, the city will refund to the temporary customer the amount paid for service installation. If the customer continues for thirty-six months, where a main extension is involved, and his or her operations at the end of that time appear permanent, the payment made under subdivision 1 of subsection A of this section will be adjusted to the terms of the extension rule applicable to permanent service. (Prior code § 1.46.130)

14.04.140 Main extensions—General provisions—Applicability.
A. All extensions of distribution mains, from the city’s basic production and transmission system or existing distribution system, to serve new customers, except for those specifically excluded in subsections B or C of this section, shall be made under the provisions of this section through Section 14.04.230 unless specific authority is first obtained from the city to deviate therefrom. A main extension contract shall be executed by the city and the applicant or applicants for the main extension before the city commences construction work on the extensions or, if constructed by the applicant or applicants, before the facilities comprising the main extension are transferred to the city.
B. Extension solely for fire hydrant, private fire protection, resale, temporary, standby, or supplemental service shall not be made under this section through Section 14.04.230.
C. The city may, but will not be required to, make extensions under this section through Section 14.04.230, in easements or rights-of-way where final grades have not been established, or where street grades have not been brought to those established by public authority. If extensions are made when grades have not been established and there is a reasonable probability that the existing grade will be changed, the city shall require that the applicant or applicants for the main extension deposit, at the time of execution of the main extension agreement, the estimated net cost of relocating, raising or lowering facilities upon establishment of final grades. Adjustment of any difference between the amount so deposited and the actual cost of relocating, raising or lowering facilities shall be made within ten days after the city has ascertained such actual cost. The net deposit representing actual cost is not subject to refund. The entire deposit related to the proposed relocation, raising or lowering shall be refunded when such displacements are determined by proper authority not to be required. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(1))

14.04.150 Main extensions—General provisions—Definitions.
For the purposes of Sections 14.04.140 through 14.04.230, the following words shall have the meanings as set forth in this section:
A. “Bona fide customer” is a customer (excluding any customer formerly served at the same location) who has given satisfactory evidence that service will be reasonably permanent to the property which has been improved with a building of a permanent nature, and to which service has commenced. The provision of service to a real estate developer or builder, during the construction or development period, shall not establish him as a bona fide customer.
B. “Real estate developer” or “builder” includes any individual, association of individuals, partnership, or corporation that divides a parcel of land into two or more portions.
C. “Adjusted construction cost” is reasonable and does not exceed the costs recorded in conformity with generally accepted water utility accounting practices, and as specifically defined in the Uniform System of Accounts for Water Utilities prescribed by the public utilities commission, of installing facilities of adequate capacity for the service requested. If the city, at its option, should install facilities with a larger capacity or resulting in a greater footage of extension than required for the service requested, the “adjusted construction cost” shall be determined by the application of an adjustment factor to actual construction cost of facilities installed. This factor shall be the ratio of estimated cost of required facilities to estimated cost of actual facilities installed. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(2))

14.04.160 Main extensions—General provisions—Ownership, design and construction of facilities.
A. Any facilities installed under this section shall be the sole property of the city.
B. The size, type, quality of materials, and their location shall be specified by the city, and the actual construction shall be done by the city or by a constructing agency acceptable to it.
C. Where the property of an applicant is located adjacent to a right-of-way, exceeding seventy feet in width, for a street, highway, or other public purpose, regardless of the width of the traveled way or pavement, or a freeway, waterway, or railroad right-of-way, the city may elect to install a main extension on the same side thereof as the property of the applicant, and the estimated and adjusted construction costs in such case shall be based upon such an extension.
D. When an extension must comply with an ordinance, regulation, or specification of a public authority, the estimated and adjusted construction costs of the extension shall be based upon the facilities required to comply therewith. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(3))

14.04.170 Main extensions—General provisions—Estimates, plans, and specifications.
A. Upon request by a potential applicant for a main extension, the city shall prepare a preliminary sketch and rough estimates of the cost of installation to be advanced by the applicant.
B. Any applicant for a main extension requesting the city to prepare detailed plans, specifications and cost estimates shall be required to deposit with the city an amount equal to the estimated cost of preparation of such material. The city shall, upon request, make available within forty-five days after receipt of the deposit referred to above in this subsection, such plans, specifications and cost estimates of the proposed main extension. If the extension is to include oversizing of facilities to be done at the city’s expense, appropriate details shall be set forth in the plans, specifications and cost estimates.
C. In the event a main extension contract with the city is executed within one hundred eighty days after the city furnished the detailed plans and specifications, the deposit shall become a part of the advance, and shall be refunded in accordance with the terms of the main extension contract. If such contract is not so executed, the deposit to cover the cost of preparing plans, specifications and cost estimates shall be forfeited by the applicant for the main extension and the amount of the forfeited deposit shall be credited to the account or accounts to which the expense of preparing the material was charged.
D. When detailed plans, specifications and cost estimates are requested, the applicant for a main extension shall furnish a map to a suitable scale showing the street and lot layouts and, when requested by the city, contours or other indication of the relative elevation of the various parts of the area to be developed. If changes are made subsequent to the presentation of this map by the applicant, and these changes require additional expense in revising plans, specifications and cost estimates, this additional expense shall be borne by the applicant, not subject to refund, and the additional expense thus recovered shall be credited to the account or accounts to which the additional expense was charged. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(4))

14.04.180 Main extensions—General provisions—Timing and adjustment of advances.
A. Unless the applicant for the main extension elects to arrange for the installation of the extension himself, the full amount of the required advance or an acceptable surety bond must be provided to the city at the time of execution of the main extension agreement.
B. If the applicant for a main extension posts a surety bond in lieu of cash, such surety bond must be replaced with cash not less than ten calendar days before construction is to commence; provided, however, that if special facilities are required primarily for the service requested, the applicant for the extension may be required to deposit sufficient cash to cover the cost of such special facilities before they are ordered by the city.
C. An applicant for a main extension who advances funds shall be provided with a statement of actual construction cost and adjusted construction cost showing in reasonable detail the costs incurred for material, labor, any other direct and indirect costs, overheads, and total costs; or unit costs; or contract costs, whichever are appropriate.
D. Such statement shall be submitted within sixty days after the actual construction costs of the installation have been ascertained by the city. In the event that the actual construction costs for the entire installation have not been determined within one hundred twenty days after completion of construction work, a preliminary determination of actual and adjusted construction costs shall be submitted, based upon the best available information at that time.
E. Any differences between the adjusted construction costs and the amount advanced shall be shown as a revision of the amount of advance and shall be payable within thirty days of the date of submission of the statement. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(5))

14.04.190 Main extensions—General provisions—Assignment of main extension contracts.
A. Any contract entered into under Sections 14.04.200 through 14.04.220, or under similar provisions of former rules, may be assigned, after settlement of adjusted construction costs, after written notice to the city by the holder of the contract as shown by the city’s records.
B. Such assignment shall apply only to those refunds which become due more than thirty days after the date of receipt by the city of the notice of assignment.
C. The city shall not be required to make any one refund payment under such contract to more than a single assignee. (Prior code § 1.46.140(a)(6))

14.04.200 Main extensions—Serving subdivisions, tracts, housing projects, industrial developments or organized commercial districts—Advances.
A. Unless the procedure outlined in subsection C of this section is followed, an applicant for a main extension to serve a new subdivision, tract, housing project, industrial development or organized commercial district shall be required to advance to the city, before construction is commenced, the estimated reasonable cost of the extension to be actually installed, from the nearest city facility at least equal in size or capacity to the main required to serve both the new customers and a reasonable estimate of the potential customers who might be served directly from the main extension without additional extension. The costs of the extension shall include necessary service stubs or service pipes, fittings, gates and housing therefor, and meter boxes, but shall not include meters. To this shall be added the cost of fire hydrants when requested by the applicant for the main extension or required by public authority, whenever such hydrants are to become the property of the city.
B. If special facilities consisting of items not covered by subsection A of this section are required for the service requested and, when such facilities to be installed will supply both the main extension and other parts of the city’s system, at least fifty percent of the design capacity (in gallons, gpm, or other appropriate units) is required to supply the main extension, the cost of such special facilities may be included in the advance, subject to refund, as provided in Section 14.04.210, along with refunds of the advance of the cost of the extension facilities described in subsection A of this section.
C. In lieu of providing the advances in accordance with subsections A and B of this section, the applicant for a main extension shall be permitted, if qualified in the judgment of the city, to construct and install the facilities himself, or arrange for their installation pursuant to competitive bidding procedures initiated by him and limited to qualified bidders. The cost, including the cost of inspection and supervision by the city, shall be paid directly by the applicant. The applicant shall provide the city with a statement of actual construction cost in reasonable detail. The amount to be treated as an advance subject to refund shall be the lesser of (1) the actual cost or (2) the price quoted in the city’s detailed cost estimate. The installation shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted by the city pursuant to subsection B of Section 14.04.180. (Prior code § 1.46.140(b)(1))

14.04.210 Main extensions—Serving subdivisions, tracts, housing projects, industrial developments or organized commercial districts—Refunds.
A. The amount advanced under subsections A, B and C of Section 14.04.200 shall be subject to refund by the city, in cash, without interest, to the party or parties entitled thereto as set forth in subsections B and C of this section. The total amount so refunded shall not exceed the total of the amount advanced. Except as provided in this section, the refunds shall be made in annual, semiannual or quarterly payments, at the election of the city, and for a period not to exceed twenty years after the date of the contract.
B. Whenever costs of main extensions have been advanced pursuant to subsections A or C of Section 14.04.200, the city shall determine the revenue received from customers, including fire protection agencies, supplied by service pipes connected directly to the extension for which the cost was advanced. The refund shall be twenty-two percent of the revenue so received.
C. Whenever costs of special facilities have been advanced pursuant to subsection B or C of Section 14.04.200, the amount so advanced shall be divided by the number of lots to be served by the special facilities. This advance per lot shall be refunded for each lot on which one or more bona fide customers are served by those facilities.
D. With respect to a contract entered into on and after the effective date of this section, if, at any time during the twenty-year refund period specified in subsection A of this section, eighty percent of the bona fide customers for which the extension or special facilities were designed are being served therefrom, the city shall immediately notify the contract holder of that fact, and at that time shall become obligated to pay, in cash, any balance which may remain unrefunded at the end of the twenty-year period. Such balance shall be refunded in five equal annual installments, payable beginning twenty-one years after the date of the contract.
E. Where a contract has been entered into under a former main extension rule, and where eighty percent of the bona fide customers for which the extension or special facilities were designed are being served therefrom, the city may negotiate and enter into a new and substitute contract, identical in all respects with the original contract, including the original termination date, except that the substitute contract shall include the following provision:
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, any unrefunded balance remaining at the termination date of this contract shall be paid in five equal annual installments beginning one year after said termination date. (Prior code § 1.46.140(b)(2))

14.04.220 Main extensions—Serving subdivisions, tracts, housing projects, industrial developments or organized commercial districts—Termination of contracts.
A. Any contract with refunds based upon percentage of revenues and entered into under Sections 14.04.200 through this section, or under similar provisions of former rules, may be purchased by the city and terminated, provided the payment is not in excess of the estimated revenue refund multiplied by the termination factor in the following table, the terms are otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties or their assignees and subsections B and C of Section 14.04.210 are complied with.
B. The estimated revenue refund is the amount that would otherwise be refunded, at the current level of refunds, over the remainder of the twenty-year contract period, or shorter period that would be required to extinguish the total refund obligation.
C. It shall be determined by multiplying twenty-two percent of the average annual revenue per service for the immediately preceding calendar year by the number of bona fide customers at the proposed termination date, times the number of years or fractions thereof to the end of the twenty-year contract period or shorter period that would be required to refund the remaining contract balance.

    Notwithstanding the limitations that are specified above in this section:
        a. The city may impose more restrictive standards or requirements on discharge if it is deemed necessary to comply with the objectives of this chapter, specific prohibitions or the terms of the city’s waste discharge order,
        b. The city may authorize discharges containing higher concentrations on a site-specific basis, provided that the concentrations of such discharges shall not cause pass through or interference. Upon approval by the city, site-specific limitations shall be established through the terms specified in the discharger’s industrial wastewater discharge permit. The city may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, concentration based limitations. However, no special agreement shall be allowed to contravene federal, state or local pretreatment standards,
        c. The city may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the requirements of this section;
    23. Any blowdown or bleed water from cooling towers or other evaporative coolers exceeding one-third of the makeup water;
    24. Any single pass cooling water;
    25. Any excessive quantities of radioactive material wastes;
    26. Recognizable portions of the human anatomy.
C. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any public sewer which directly or indirectly connects to the city’s sewerage system any wastes, which will cause interference or pass through, or if in the opinion of the city engineer such wastes may have an adverse or harmful effect on sewers, maintenance personnel, wastewater treatment plant personnel or equipment, treatment plant effluent quality, public or private property, or may otherwise endanger the public, the local environment or create a public nuisance. The city engineer, in determining the acceptability of specific wastes, shall consider the nature of the waste and the adequacy and nature of the collection, treatment and disposal system available to accept the waste.
D. The city engineer shall from time to time prepare a list of the maximum permissible quantities or concentrations of certain constituents in industrial wastewater flows and otherwise issue detailed directions for meeting the requirements of this section. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 4540 § 3, 2008; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.230 Hospital wastes.
A. Hospitals, clinics, offices of medical doctors and convalescent homes:
    1. May discharge, through a city-approved grinder installation with inlet size and design features suitable for its intended use and so constructed that all particles pass through a maximum three-eighth inch opening, wastes of the following categories:
        a. Wet organic kitchen wastes from food preparation and disposal but excluding all paper and plastic items;
        b. Disposable hypodermic needles, syringes and associated articles following their use;
        c. Infectious wastes, defined as:

        a. Solid wastes generated in the rooms of patients who are not isolated because of a suspected or diagnosed communicable disease;
        b. Recognizable portions of the human anatomy;
        c. Wastes excluded by other provisions of this chapter except as specifically permitted in subsection (A)(1) of this section;
        d. All solid wastes not included in subsection (A)(1) of this section.
B. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the health officer of the county to define wastes as being infectious and, with the concurrence of the city engineer, to require that they be discharged to the sewer. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

V. Industrial Wastewaters

14.12.240 Discharge permit—Requirements generally.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to sewerage facilities owned by the city without first obtaining a city permit for industrial wastewater discharge.
B. The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may require pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, restriction of peak flow discharges, discharge of certain wastewaters only to specified sewers of the city, relocation of point of discharge, prohibition of discharge of certain wastewater components, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased costs of the city created by the wastewater discharge and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. Specific discharge limits, as specified in the national categorical standards, shall be included in each permit: provided, however, that if no such limit has been established, the city engineer shall ascertain the limit to be applied to the discharger and such limit shall be incorporated in the permit. Those limits set by the city engineer pursuant to subsection B of Section 14.12.220 of this chapter shall be no less stringent than applicable state and national categorical standards. Effluent discharge limits may include best management practices based on applicable pretreatment standards.
C. No person shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by the permit for industrial wastewater discharge. Any person desiring to discharge wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with the industrial wastewater permit or desiring to change its discharge parameters, shall apply to the city for an amended permit. An amended permit shall be secured before discharging at limits in excess of the current permit condition. New or increased contributions of pollutants to the city sewerage system by industrial users, where such contribution do not meet applicable national pretreatment standards and the requirements set forth in this chapter or where such contributions would cause the city to violate its waste discharge requirements, are prohibited, and no amended permit shall be issued for such contributions.
D. A schedule for complying with any industrial effluent limitations, self-monitoring requirements or other requirements deemed necessary by the city engineer to insure compliance with city, county, state or federal rules and regulations shall be submitted to the city for approval. The city engineer may require compliance schedule progress reports, a report on final compliance with effluent limitations and standards, and periodic reports on continued compliance.
E. Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the city to be necessary. The city engineer shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The city engineer may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the city engineer may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
    1. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
    2. Description of stored chemicals;
    3. Procedures for immediately notifying the city engineer of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 14.12.325(H); and
    4. Procedures to Prevent Adverse Impact from any Accidental or Slug Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.250 Discharge permit—Application procedure—Conditions for approval.
A. Applicants for a permit for industrial wastewater discharge shall complete a city application form available at the office of the city engineer. The city may require additional information on the characteristics of the wastewater discharge beyond that required on the application form.
B. Any person signing the application statement submitted pursuant to this section shall make the following certification:“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
C. Upon approval of the application, an industrial waste discharge permit will be issued and the application, plans, specifications and data (the compliance schedule in the case of an interim permit) submitted in support will be considered as part of the discharge permit.
D. The application shall be approved if the applicant has complied with all applicable requirements of this chapter and furnished to the city all requested information and if the city engineer determines that there is adequate capacity in the city’s facilities to convey, treat and dispose of the wastewaters. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.260 Discharge permit—Change of restrictions.
A. The city may change the restrictions or conditions of a permit for industrial wastewater discharge from time to time as circumstances may require.
B. The city shall allow an industrial discharger a reasonable period of time to comply with any changes in the industrial wastewater permit required by the city. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.270 Discharge permit—Suspension—Conditions for reinstatement.
A. The city engineer may suspend a permit for industrial wastewater discharge when such suspension is necessary in order to stop a discharge which presents an actual or threatened hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, to the local environment or to the city’s sewerage system.
B. Any discharger notified of a suspension of his or her industrial wastewater permit shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all industrial wastewater to the sewerage system. In the event of a failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city engineer or wastewater manager shall take such steps as set forth in this chapter to ensure compliance.
C. The city engineer shall reinstate the industrial wastewater permit upon proof of satisfactory compliance with all discharge requirements of the city. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 4198 § 1, 2004; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.280 Discharge permit—Revocation.
The city engineer may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
A. Failure to notify the city engineer of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
B. Failure to provide prior notification to the city engineer of changed conditions pursuant to Section 14.12.240(C) of this chapter;
C. Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application;
D. Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
E. Tampering with monitoring equipment;
F. Refusing to allow the city engineer timely access to the facility premises and records;
G. Failure to meet effluent limitations;
H. Failure to pay fines;
I. Failure to pay sewer charges;
J. Failure to meet compliance schedules;
K. Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application;
L. Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; or
M. Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that user. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.290 Restrictions or refusal of service pursuant to availability of city’s facilities.
A. If sewerage capacity is not available, the city may require the industrial wastewater discharger to restrict his or her discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available.
B. When requested, the city will advise persons desiring to locate new facilities as to the areas where industrial wastewater of their proposed quantity and quality can be received by available sewerage facilities.
C. The city may refuse service to persons locating facilities in areas where their proposed quantity or quality of industrial wastewater is unacceptable in the available treatment facility. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.300 Pretreatment—Devices required.
A. An industrial wastewater pretreatment system or device may be required by the city engineer to treat industrial flows prior to discharge to the sewer when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge to the sewer of certain waste constituents, to distribute more equally over a longer time period any peak discharges of industrial wastewaters or to accomplish any pretreatment result required by the city engineer. All pretreatment systems or devices shall be approved by the city engineer but such approval shall not absolve the industrial discharger of the responsibility for meeting any industrial effluent limitation required by the city including all applicable federal, state and local limitations and requirements. In special cases, the city engineer may require construction of sewer lines by the discharger to convey certain industrial wastes to a specific city trunk sewer. All pretreatment systems judged by the city engineer to require engineering design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed in the state. In no case shall an industrial waste discharger be absolved of the responsibility of complying with applicable industrial waste discharge standards or requirements established by the state or local government or established by the federal government pursuant to Section 307 of the Clean Water Act, as amended or the federal pretreatment regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 307. This includes both existing standards or requirements and any standards or requirements which may be enacted or promulgated by the federal, state, or local government.
B. Normally a gravity separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber, control manhole or other monitoring facility, and a spill containment system, will be required respectively to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and/or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flows, to facilitate inspection, flow measurement and sampling, and to prevent discharge to the sewer of quantities of toxic materials due to rupture of a tank or pipeline or other such accidental occurrences. Spill containment systems shall conform to requirements established by the city engineer and shall in no event be dependent upon electrical or other energy. No industrial waste discharger shall operate a spill containment system that allows incompatible liquids to mix thereby creating hazardous or toxic substances in the event of the failure of more than one container. Floor drains from commercial or manufacturing buildings, warehouses or multi-use structures shall not discharge directly to the sewer, but shall first discharge to a gravity separation interceptor. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.310 Separation of domestic and industrial wastewaters.
All domestic wastewaters from rest rooms, showers, drinking fountains, etc., shall be kept separate from all industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment system or device and the industrial wastewater monitoring facility or stations. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.320 Sampling, analysis and flow measurements.
A. Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, BOD and suspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial wastewater treatment surcharge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary by the city engineer shall be made by all industrial wastewater dischargers, unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the city engineer. All sampling, analyses and flow measurements of industrial wastewaters shall be performed by a state-certified independent laboratory, by a laboratory of an industrial discharger approved by the city engineer or by personnel of the city. Prior to submittal to the city of data developed in the laboratory of an industrial discharger, the results shall be verified by a responsible administrative official of the industrial discharger under the penalty of perjury.
B. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Regional EPA Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the city or other parties, approved by the Regional EPA Administrator. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing tests shall furnish any required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used, if requested to do so by the city engineer.
C. All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at the control manhole or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter or similar device approved by the city engineer and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the city engineer in lieu of wastewater flow measurement, the city engineer may accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by suitable factors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial wastewater discharge.
D. The sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures, equipment and results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the city. Sampling and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to authorized personnel.
E. Those industrial wastewater dischargers required by the city engineer to make periodic measurements of industrial wastewater flows and constituents shall annually make the minimum number of such measurements required. The minimum requirement for such periodic measurements shall be at least two twenty-four-hour measurements per year. Representative samples of the industrial wastewater shall be obtained at least once per hour over the twenty-four-hour period, properly refrigerated, composited according to measured flow rates during the twenty-four hours and analyzed for the specified wastewater constituents.
Dischargers required to sample on only a few days per year shall sample during the periods of highest wastewater flow and wastewater constituent discharges. Industrial plants with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for every working day. When required by the city engineer, dischargers shall install and maintain in proper order automatic flow proportional sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and recording equipment.
F. Measurements to verify the quantities of waste flows and waste constituents reported by industrial dischargers will be conducted on a random basis by personnel of the city.
G. Each industrial discharger, including those subject to self-monitoring and reporting requirements, shall retain for a minimum of three years records of monitoring activities and results required by this chapter, including documentation associated with best management practices established under Section 14.12.220(B)(22), and shall make such records available upon request for inspection and copying by inspectors and other authorized personnel of the city acting pursuant to Section 14.12.100 or otherwise pursuant to this chapter. Such records shall be retained during the pendency of any litigation regarding industrial discharge or for such additional periods as may be requested by county, state or federal entities.
H. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
    1. Except as indicated in subsections 2 and 3 below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
    2. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
    3. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in Section 14.12.325(A) and (C) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 14.12.325(D) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.325 Reporting requirements for industrial users.
A. Baseline Monitoring Reports. Within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsections (A)(1) through (A)(7) of this section. At least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsections (A)(1) through (A)(5) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (A)(4) and (A)(5) of this section.
    1. Identifying Information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
    2. Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;
    3. Description of Operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes;
    4. Flow Measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
        a. Regulated process streams, and
        b. Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). (See subsection (A)(5)(d) of this section.) The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations;
    5. Measurement of Pollutants. 
        a. The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process,
        b. In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard,
        c. The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection,
        d. Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the city,
        e. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques specified in Section 14.12.320,
        f. The city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures,
        g. The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW;
    6. Certification. The users shall submit a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in Section 14.12.250(B) and certified to by a qualified professional) indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and
    7. Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user shall submit the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.
        a. Where the industrial user’s categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by subsection A of this section, the information required by subsections (A)(6) and (A)(7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
        b. If the categorical pretreatment standards are modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection A of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (A)(6) and (A)(7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the city within sixty days after the modified limit is approved.
B. Compliance Schedule for Meeting Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection (A)(7) of this section:
    1. The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
    2. No increment referred to in subsection (B)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months.
    3. Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city.
C. Report on Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline. Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsections (A)(4) through (A)(6) of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
D. Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance. 
    1. All significant industrial users are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they have been designated a nonsignificant categorical industrial user under the provisions of Section 14.12.030 of this chapter. All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the city, submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the city or the approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in subsection (A)(4) of this section except that the city may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
    2. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 14.12.250(B).
    3. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
    4. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the city, using procedures prescribed in Section 14.12.320 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
    5. Where the city has imposed mass limitations on industrial users as provided for by 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by subsection (D)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
    6. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by subsection (D)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by subsection (D)(1) shall include the user’s actual average production rate for the reporting period.
E. Reporting Requirements for Industrial Users not Subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The city shall require appropriate reporting from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the city at least once every six months (on dates specified by the city) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the city. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. In cases where a local limit or discharge permit requires compliance with a best management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user must submit documentation required by the city to determine the compliance status of the user.
F. Annual Certification for Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users. A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the city pursuant to Section 14.12.030 must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in Section 14.12.250(B). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the city.Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR __, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from _________, _________ to __________,
[months, days, year]:
(a) The facility described as _____________ [facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as defined in Section 14.12.030;
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
This compliance certification is based on the following information:
________________________________________________________________
G. Notice of Violation/Resampling Requirement. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if:
    1. The city performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
    2. The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling; or
    3. The city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
H. Notice of Slug Discharge. In the event a slug discharge occurs, the discharger shall notify the city immediately by phone, followed with a written notification. Said written notification discussing circumstances and remedies shall be submitted to the city within five days of the occurrence.
I. Notice of Discharge of Hazardous Wastes. 
    1. The industrial user shall notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. All notifications must take place within one hundred eighty days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subdivision need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e), or Section 14.12.325 of this chapter.
    2. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (I)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
    3. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety days of the effective date of such regulations.
    4. In the case of any notification made under subsection I of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has been determined to be economically practical.
J. Reports of Potential Problems. 
    1. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
    2. Significant industrial users are required to notify the city immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.330 Discrepancies between actual and reported discharge quantities.
A. Should measurements or other investigations reveal that the industrial discharger is discharging a flow rate, or a quantity of flow, biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids significantly in excess of that stated on the industrial wastewater permit or in excess of the quantities reported to the city by the discharger and upon which the industrial wastewater treatment surcharge is based, the discharger shall apply for an amended industrial wastewater permit and shall be assessed for all delinquent charges together with the penalty and interest provided for in Section 14.12.390. Before these charges shall be assessed at least two additional twenty-four-hour samples and flow measurements shall be obtained by the city with all costs of sampling and analyses to be paid by the discharger.
B. For the purpose of establishing the correct treatment surcharge, the data obtained in these samplings along with any other relevant information obtained by the city or presented by the discharger, shall be used by the city engineer in determining the quantity parameters for use in the surcharge formula. An industrial discharger found in violation shall, in the absence of other evidence, be presumed to have been discharging at the determined parameter values over the preceding three years or subsequent to the previous city verification of quantity parameters, whichever period is shorter. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.340 Industry discharge classifications—Parameter establishing surcharge.
The city engineer may classify dischargers by industrial categories and establish an industrial wastewater treatment surcharge based upon average flow quality and flow quantity for the industrial category adjusted by some commonly recognized parameter selected by the city engineer that establishes the relative size of the industrial discharger being charged. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.350 Damage caused by prohibited discharge, slug discharges, or by other causes.
Any industrial wastewater discharger who discharges or causes the discharge of prohibited wastewaters or slug discharges which cause damage to city’s facilities, detrimental effects on treatment processes, or any other damages resulting in costs to the city shall be liable to the city for all damages occasioned thereby. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

14.12.360 Existing dischargers.
A. All persons discharging industrial wastewater directly or indirectly to the city’s sewerage systems prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and who have obtained a permit or approval of industrial wastewater discharge from the local sewering agency or from the city are granted a temporary permit to discharge industrial wastewaters.
B. This temporary permit shall expire six months after notification by the city engineer that a new permit is to be obtained, or after two years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whichever should first occur.
C. Prior to the expiration of the temporary permit, the industrial wastewater discharger shall apply for and obtain a permit for industrial wastewater discharge. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

VI. Trucker’s Discharge Permits

14.12.370 Requirements.
A. All persons owning vacuum or “cesspool” pump trucks or other liquid waste transport trucks and desiring to discharge septic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents, industrial liquid wastes or other liquid wastes to sewerage facilities of the city or to facilities that discharge directly or indirectly to such sewerage facilities shall first have a valid city’s trucker’s discharge permit. All applicants for a trucker’s discharge permit shall complete the application form, pay the appropriate fee, receive a copy of the city’s regulations governing discharge to sewers of liquid wastes from trucks and shall agree, in writing, to abide by these regulations.
B. Discharge of septic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents or other wastes containing no industrial wastes may be made by trucks holding a city’s permit at the city’s designated public dumping location. Truck transported industrial wastes shall be discharged only at the locations specified by the city engineer for the specific waste. The city may require payment for treatment and disposal costs or may refuse permission to discharge certain prohibited wastes.
C. The trucker’s discharge permit shall be valid for one year from date of issuance.
D. Any person negligently or willfully violating the city’s requirements for liquid waste discharges from trucks shall be in violation of this chapter and may have his or her permit revoked by the city engineer. (Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3667 § 1, 1995)

VII. User Charges and Fees

The notice of appeal shall set forth in detail all relevant facts supporting the appeal of the decision of the city engineer. The filing of the notice of appeal shall stay further action required under any notice of violation or cease and desist orders and accumulation of interest upon penalties thereon, pending final decision by the city manager, or designee, on the appeal; provided, however, that nothing stated in this section shall limit the authority of the city engineer to take such action or to make such directives as the city engineer deems necessary to stop or prevent an ongoing or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, including actions or directives to prevent or stop:
    1. Threatened damage to the POTW, the sewer or the wastewater treatment plant;
    2. A pass through; or
    3. Threatened harm to the health or safety of the public.
Such action shall include, without limitation, continuing to physically block the discharger’s or industrial user’s access to the sewer or POTW until the appeal is heard and decided by the city manager, or designee.
B. Upon an appeal brought to the city manager, or designee, by the written notice of appeal, the city manager, or designee, shall set the matter for hearing and after said hearing may affirm, overrule or modify the decision, action or determination of the city engineer which is the subject of the appeal. The city manager, or designee, shall have the further authority to condition any penalties imposed or the corrective action required or to reduce or increase the penalties imposed by the city engineer. Failure of the discharger or industrial user to comply with the city manager’s, or designee’s, decision or to make arrangements for compliance satisfactory to the city engineer within ten days of the date of the city manager’s, or designee’s, decision shall result in the termination of the discharger’s or industrial user’s right to discharge into the sewer. If the industrial user is discharging pursuant to an industrial wastewater discharge permit, such inaction shall result in the termination of the industrial user’s permit. The city engineer shall thereupon order physical termination of the service forthwith, which service shall not be resumed until the industrial user fully complies with the city manager’s, or designee’s, decision.
C. Appeal decisions made by the city manager, or designee, shall be final for all administrative purposes and, except as to civil penalty imposed according to the procedure provided by this chapter, shall be subject to review under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 (with respect to decisions not requiring an evidentiary hearing) or Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 through 1094.6 (with respect to decisions made after an evidentiary hearing). All judicial review shall be based on abuse of legal discretion/substantial evidence standard. (Ord. 4988 § 1, 2019; Ord. 4740 § 1, 2013; Ord. 4198 § 3, 2004)

G. The decision of the advisory agency shall be subject to appeal as provided in this title. (Ord. 4966 § 1, 2019; Ord. 4939 § 7, 2018; Ord. 4714 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4633 § 2, 2010; Ord. 4598 § 1, 2009; Ord. 4392 § 1, 2006; Ord. 4059 § 3, 2002; Ord. 3748 § 5, 1997; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.16.070 Findings by advisory agency.
A. Delegation. The responsibility for determining satisfaction of the following requirements is assigned to the advisory agency pursuant to Section 66474.7 of the Map Act:
    1. No map shall be approved unless the advisory agency finds that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvements, is consistent with the general plan as required by Article 5 (commencing with Section 65300) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of the Government Code, or any specific plan adopted pursuant to Article 8 (commencing with Section 65450) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of the Government Code, and makes the findings required by Sections 66412.3 and 66473.1 of the Map Act.
    2. The advisory agency shall deny approval of a final or tentative subdivision map if it makes any of the following findings:
        a. That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;
        b. That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans;
        c. That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development;
        d. That the site is not physically suitable for proposed density of development;
        e. Except as provided in Section 66474.01 of the Map Act, that the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;
        f. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems;
        g. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the advisory agency may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to those previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is granted to the advisory agency to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.
    3. The advisory agency shall determine whether the discharge of waste from the proposed subdivision into an existing community sewer system would result in violation of existing requirements prescribed by a California Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the Water Code. In the event that the advisory agency finds that the proposed waste discharge would result in or add to violation of requirements of such board, it may disapprove the tentative map or maps of the subdivision.
B. Compliance with Tentative Map. The city council shall not deny approval of a final map pursuant to Section 66474 of the Map Act if the advisory agency (or city council on appeal) has previously approved a tentative map for the proposed subdivision, if the city council finds that the final map is in substantial compliance with the previously approved tentative map.
C. Appeal. Any interested person may appeal any decision of the advisory agency relative to the matters set forth in subsection A of this section to the city council, following the procedure set forth in Chapter 16.52. Such appellant shall be entitled to the same notice and rights regarding testimony as are accorded a subdivider under Section 66452.5. (Ord. 3748 § 5, 1997; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.16.080 Expiration of map approval—Extension.
A. An approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall expire thirty-six months after its approval or conditional approval; provided, however, that any tentative map approved or conditionally approved by Kern County for an area which is subsequently annexed into the city prior to recordation of a final map shall expire in accordance with the ordinance requirements of Kern County and the Subdivision Map Act.
B. An extension or extensions of tentative map approval or conditional approval shall not exceed an aggregate of six years. However, if an extension of time application is appealed in accordance with Chapter 16.52, an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall not expire prior to a decision by the city council in accordance with Chapter 16.52.
C. The subdivider may request an extension of the tentative map approval or conditional approval by written application to the advisory agency. Such application shall be filed before the approval or conditional approval is due to expire, but shall not be filed any sooner than sixty days prior to expiration date of the tentative map. The application shall state the reasons for requesting the extension. Consent of the subdivider to new or revised conditions required by the advisory agency shall be a prerequisite to approval of any extension.
D. Failure to file a final tract map or a final parcel map with the city engineer within thirty-six months from the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map or within the specified time period on any extension thereof, shall terminate all proceedings. Before such final tract or final parcel map may thereafter be filed with the county recorder a new tentative map shall be submitted.
E. If the subdivider whose tract has been approved by the advisory agency for multiple, or phased, final maps is subject to a requirement of two hundred thirty-six thousand seven hundred ninety dollars or more, as adjusted pursuant to Section 66452.6(a)(2) of the Map Act, to construct or improve or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the boundaries of the tentative map, each filing of a final map authorized by Section 66456.1 of the Map Act shall extend the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map by thirty-six months from the date of its expiration as provided in this section, or the date of the previously approved final map, whichever is later. The extensions shall not extend the tentative map more than ten years from its approval or conditional approval.
Prior to the filing of the first final map, the subdivider shall make written notification to the city engineer of eligibility for such extension of time. Such notification shall include documentation as determined by the city engineer by which eligibility can be verified. Public improvements, as used in this subsection, include fees, traffic controls, streets, roads, highways, freeways, bridges, overcrossings, street interchanges, flood control or storm drain facilities, sewer facilities, water facilities, and lighting facilities.
F. A tentative map on property subject to a development agreement may be extended for the period of time provided for in the agreement, but not beyond the duration of the agreement.
G. After approval of the tentative map, if changes deemed substantial by the city engineer are proposed, a filing of a revised tentative map will be required.
    1. The previously assigned tract number will be used with the word “Revised” added to the number. The procedure for filing a revised tentative map is the same as for the tentative map. A revised tentative map cannot be filed if the approval on the original map has expired. An approved revised tentative map supersedes the tentative map for which it was filed.
    2. A revised tentative map will be required to include all the land subdivided under the originally assigned tract number, as approved by the advisory agency, except a phase or phases of the original tentative map which have recorded in accordance with this chapter shall be excluded from the revised tentative map.
    3. A revised map cannot materially increase the area being subdivided under the original map.
    4. With the approval of the city engineer and planning director, two adjacent tentative maps may be remapped through application for a revised map as one revised tentative map. The map number utilized on the revised map shall be subject to approval by the city.
    5. The revised map process may be utilized to remap an area of a recorded parcel, which was originally established for recordation of the future phases of the underlying tentative map. (Ord. 4707 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4599 § 1, 2009; Ord. 4147 § 1, 2003; Ord. 4004 § 7, 2001; Ord. 3748 § 5, 1997; Ord. 3612 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.16.090 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documentation for map approval.
A. No tentative map shall be approved until the appropriate CEQA documentation is prepared, processed and considered in accordance with the provisions of the city’s CEQA resolution.
B. The subdivider shall provide such additional data and information, which may be required to appropriately evaluate environmental impacts, and deposit and pay such fees as may be required for the preparation and processing of any required documents. (Ord. 3748 § 5, 1997; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.16.100 Map approval conditioned on compliance with grading and erosion control.
Every tentative map approved pursuant to this title shall be conditioned to comply with the requirements for grading and erosion control, including the prevention of sedimentation or damage to off-site property, set forth in Chapter 70 of the Building Code adopted by the city. (Ord. 4715 § 1, 2012; Ord. 3748 § 5, 1997; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

A statement, signed and acknowledged by all parties having any record title interest in the real property subdivided, consenting to the preparation and recordation of the final tract map is required, except as omitted pursuant to this section.
A. The signatures of each party owning a recorded interest in, or right to, minerals, including, but not limited to, oil, gas, or other hydrocarbon substances, not including lessees of such rights, shall be required unless his or her name and the nature of his or her respective interest are stated on the final map and the advisory agency determines, or on appeal the city council finds, at least one of the following applies:
    1. The party’s right of surface entry has been expressly waived by recorded document, including, but not limited to, quitclaim deed and/or reservation.
    2. The party’s interest is less than twenty percent of the mineral interest estate and the signature or express waiver of right of surface entry by recorded document including, but not limited to, quitclaim deeds and/or reservations of one or more parties having a combined interest of more than fifty percent of the mineral interest estate has been obtained. The subdivider shall comply with the notice requirements listed below:
        a. At least thirty days prior to the date of hearing on the tentative map, the subdivider has given written notice, by registered mail or, if impracticable as determined by the planning director, by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation;
        b. Notice shall be given to each mineral owner and lessee and operator of record who has not waived his or her right of surface entry underlying the subdivision as set forth in the preliminary title report, or other similar document acceptable by the planning director, as required by Section 16.16.010(D) and as shown in D.O.G.G.R. records as operator of record as of thirty days of the date of application of the tentative map;
        c. Such notice shall include the nature and location of the project, including a tract or parcel map number and a clearly drawn location map of the project area, and the tentative date, time and place of the hearing;
        d. A copy of the notice and proof of mailing shall be provided to the planning director within ten days of the mailing/publication date.
    3. The subdivider intends to reserve a drill site or sites as defined in Section 15.66.080(C) on or within a practicable distance of the subdivision as determined by the advisory agency, and as to which the owner of the mineral interest has a right of access and use that is or has been reserved and is delineated and labeled as such on the approved tentative map for the subdivision or, if outside the boundaries of the subdivision, is specifically described on the approved tentative map; and is subject to the following notice requirements:
        a. At least thirty days prior to the date of hearing on the tentative map, the subdivider has given written notice, by registered mail or, if impracticable as determined by the planning director, by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation.
        b. Notice shall be given to each mineral owner and lessee of record who has not waived his or her right of surface entry underlying the subdivision as set forth in the preliminary title report, or other similar document acceptable by the planning director, as required by Section 16.16.010(D) and as shown in D.O.G.G.R. records as operator of record as of thirty days of the date of application of the tentative map.
        c. Such notice shall include a statement of intent to reserve a drill site or sites as defined in Section 15.66.080(C) on or within a practicable distance of the subdivision map as determined by the advisory agency, and as to which the owner of the mineral interest has a right of access and use, is or has been reserved and is delineated and labeled as such on the approved tentative map for the subdivision or, if outside the boundaries of the subdivision, is specifically described on the approved tentative map. Said notice shall also include the nature and location of the project, including a tract or parcel map number and a clearly drawn location map of the project area, and the tentative hearing date, and time and place of the hearing.
        d. A copy of the notice and proof of mailing shall be provided to the planning director within ten days of the mailing/publication date. The advisory agency may require the subdivider to install a wall or fence and landscaping around any or all reserved drill sites and that adequate provisions be made for maintenance thereof. Drilling within the reserved drill site shall be subject to compliance with all conditions and mitigation required under applicable regulations and processes.
        e. Such drill site reservation(s) shall remain in effect for a period not less than ten years from approval of the tentative map. The commencement of drilling and/or extraction of minerals upon that site shall automatically extend the ten-year time period until operations on the drill site are properly abandoned to the satisfaction of the D.O.G.G.R. If no drilling and/or extraction of minerals occurs on the drill site within ten years and the surface fee owner has provided notice and documentation as required in subsection (A)(4) of this section, or upon the planning director receiving proof of well abandonment to the satisfaction of the D.O.G.G.R., the surface fee owner may apply for tentative map approval on a drill site(s) or, by written correspondence to the planning director, may request that the planning commission conduct a public hearing to consider the filing of an amending map to remove the drill site(s) reservation designation from the final map. Said request shall be processed as an amending map in accordance with Section 66472.1 of the Map Act. Such request shall include a preliminary title report, or other similar document acceptable by the planning director, covering all easements, ownerships and titles with respect to the drill site parcel(s), including mineral owners and lessees of record as set forth in the preliminary title report, or other similar document acceptable by the planning director, required by Section 16.16.010(D), and two sets of postage prepaid, unsealed envelopes addressed to all mineral owners and lessees of record appearing on the title report. Notice of public hearing shall be in accordance with Section 16.16.060.
    4. The subdivider submits with the subdivision application competent, technical evidence that production of minerals from beneath the subdivision is improbable. The subdivider shall comply with the notice requirements listed below. If the advisory agency determines to its satisfaction that production of minerals from beneath the subdivision is improbable, the advisory agency shall make such finding.
        a. At least thirty days prior to the date of hearing on the tentative map, the subdivider has given written notice, by registered mail or, if impracticable as determined by the planning director, by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation.
        b. Notice shall be given to each mineral owner and lessee and operator of record who has not waived his or her right of surface entry underlying the subdivision as set forth in the preliminary title report, or other similar document acceptable by the planning director, required by Section 16.16.010(D) and as shown in D.O.G.G.R. records as operator of record as of thirty days of the date of application of the tentative map.
        c. Such notice shall include a statement of intent to present at the hearing competent, technical evidence establishing to the satisfaction of the advisory agency that production of minerals from beneath the subdivision is improbable. The notice shall also include the nature and location of the project, including a tract or parcel map number and a clearly drawn location map of the project area, and the tentative date, time and place of the hearing.
        d. A copy of the notice and proof of mailing shall be provided to the planning director within ten days of the mailing/publication date.
B. The provisions of subsection A of this section shall be applicable to any final subdivision map unless each lot or parcel created has a gross area of twenty acres or more. In addition, the provisions of subsection A of this section shall not apply where the initial gross area of the final subdivision map is less than five acres in a residential zone or less than two acres in any zone other than a residential zone. In addition, the provisions of subsection A of this section shall not apply to parcel maps creating four or fewer parcels.
C. The provisions of subsection A of this section shall not be applicable to any tract map or final parcel map which is fully developed or further subdivides property which has been previously subdivided and to which the requirements of subsection A of this section were applied at the time of the previous subdivision, unless the tract or parcel map proposes subdivision of a drilling site.
D. For purposes of subsection A of this section, a party’s ownership of a fractional portion of an undivided interest in minerals shall be considered a separate interest in the minerals estate. For example, ownership of one one-hundredth of a one-half undivided interest in the mineral estate shall be considered ownership of one-half percent of the mineral estate. (Ord. 4966 § 1, 2019; Ord. 4708 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4598 § 2, 2009; Ord. 4299 § 1, 2006; Ord. 4232 § 3, 2005; Ord. 4059 § 4, 2002; Ord. 3576 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

The subdivider may request that the local agency make such a determination and reconvey the land to the subdivider as provided above, but the local agency may assess a fee for making the determination. The fee may not exceed the cost of making the determination. The local agency shall give the subdivider sixty days notice prior to vacating, leasing, selling or otherwise disposing of the dedicated property, unless the dedicated property will be used for the same public purpose for which it was dedicated. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.080 Clerk’s statement.
The final map shall contain a certificate for execution by the clerk of the city council stating that the city council approved the map and accepted, accepted subject to improvements, or rejected, on behalf of the public, any real property offered for dedication for public use in conformity with the terms of the offer of dedication.

C. All provisions of the Map Act and this title applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map have been complied with;
D. He or she is satisfied that the map is technically correct. All such statements shall be dated. (Ord. 3597 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.110 Statement of planning director.
A statement by the planning director is required on the final tract map. He or she shall state that:
A. The planning commission, or city council upon appeal, approved or conditionally approved the tentative map and any applicable extensions thereof and the date such action was taken.
B. The subdivision, as shown on the final map, is substantially the same as it appeared on the tentative map and in accordance with any conditions approved by the commission, or city council upon appeal. (Ord. 4004 § 8, 2001; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.120 Filing certificates, security and making payments prior to filing map.
Prior to the filing of the final map with the city council, the owner or subdivider shall file such certificate and such security and make such payments as are required by Sections 66492, 66493 and 66494 of the Map Act, and shall comply fully with such provisions of law. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.130 Approval procedure—Subdivision guarantee.
A. The city council shall, at the meeting at which it receives the map or at its next regular meeting after the meeting at which it receives the map, approve the map unless it fails to conform to or satisfy requirements or conditions which were applicable to the subdivision at the time of approval of the tentative map. Disapproval shall be accompanied by findings identifying requirements or conditions which have not been met. The city council may waive compliance with the conditions and requirements if it finds such noncompliance to have been the result of technical and inadvertent error not materially affecting the validity of the map.
B. If the city council does not approve or disapprove the map within the prescribed time, or any authorized extension thereof, and the map conforms to all said requirements and rulings, it shall be deemed approved, and the clerk of the city council shall certify its approval thereon.
C. Before recording of any final tract map, the subdivider shall obtain a subdivision guarantee in a form and amount acceptable to the city attorney, providing assurance to the county and city that the parties consenting to the filing of the final map are all of the parties having a record title interest in the real property being subdivided whose signatures are required in Section 16.20.060, as shown by the records in the office of the recorder. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.140 Transmittal of maps.
After approval by the city council of a final tract map, the city clerk shall transmit the map in accordance with the provisions of Section 66464 of the Map Act. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.20.150 Correction and amendment of final maps.
A. A recorded final tract map may be amended as set forth in Section 66470 of the Map Act for any of the reasons set forth in Section 66469 of the Map Act.
B. A recorded final tract map may be modified by a certificate of correction or an amending map for reasons other than those set forth in Section 66469 of the Map Act, if after a noticed public hearing, the Planning Commission finds as follows:
    1. There are changes in circumstances which make any or all of the conditions of the map no longer appropriate or necessary; and
    2. The modifications do not impose any additional burden on the present fee owner of the property; and

The subdivider may request that the local agency make such a determination and reconvey the land to the subdivider as provided above, but the agency may assess a fee for making the determination. The fee may not exceed the cost of making the determination. The local agency must give the subdivider sixty days’ notice prior to vacating, leasing, selling or otherwise disposing of the dedicated property unless the dedicated property will be used for the same public purpose for which it was dedicated. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.22.040 Improvements completed or completion agreement.

B. A recorded parcel map may be modified by a certificate of correction or an amending map for reasons other than those set forth in Section 66469 of the Map Act, if after a noticed public hearing, the Planning Commission finds as follows:
    1. There are changes in circumstances which make any or all of the conditions of the map no longer appropriate or necessary; and
    2. The modifications do not impose any additional burden on the present fee owner of the property; and
    3. The modifications do not alter any right, title, or interest in the real property reflected on the recorded map; and
    4. The map, as modified, conforms to the provisions of Section 66474 of the Map Act.

16.24.020 Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the vesting tentative map statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this title. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this title shall apply to maps considered under this chapter.
To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.030 Consistency.
No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by Title 17 or other applicable provisions of this code. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.050 Application.
Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by this title, requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.060 Filing and processing.
A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this title for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:
A. At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words Vesting Tentative Map.
B. At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, a subdivider may also be required to supply the following information:
    1. In the case of optional design subdivisions, a site development plan showing, in general, height, size, and location of buildings, number of dwelling units, number and location of parking spaces, landscape areas, and park sites, if any;
    2. Sewer, water, drainage system details (including size and location of all mains) and size, location, and landscaping (and walls) of all streets;
    3. Flood control information (as required by the city engineer);
    4. Preliminary soils report;
    5. Other information which is deemed to be necessary for determining consistency with CEQA, and/or which is necessary to comply with federal or state requirements. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.070 Fees.
Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required by city council resolution. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.080 Expiration.
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by this title for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.090 Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map.
A. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2.
However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.
B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:
    1. A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; or
    2. The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law.
C. The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.24.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:
    1. An initial time period of twelve months. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.
    2. The initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed.
    3. The initial time period set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section shall be automatically extended by one year as permitted by Government Code Section 66498.5 without the need for a separate application.
    4. If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (C)(1) through (3) of this section, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit. The time limits set forth herein shall specifically apply only to those building permit applications submitted during the periods of time specified in subsections (C)(1) through (3) of this section. The expiration and extension of such building permits shall be governed by the specific provisions of Chapter 15.05 of this code (Building Code) pertaining to permit issuance. (Ord. 4985 § 1, 2019; Ord. 4715 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4232 § 5, 2005; Ord. 4004 § 10, 2001; Ord. 3748 § 9, 1997; Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.100 Development inconsistent with zoning—Conditional approval.
Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city shall deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.24.090(A), confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved.
The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.24.090(C). (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.24.110 Applications inconsistent with current policies.
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Sections 16.24.090(A) and 16.24.100, and the city may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

(Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.28.070 Private streets—Approval—Map—Posting.
A. 
    1. With approval of the advisory agency, any street, highway or way which is intended to be kept closed to public travel and posted as a private street shall be shown as a private street on the tentative and final map. Such private street shall be permitted only on conditions which guarantee reasonable maintenance thereof in accordance with Section 16.36.020.
    2. A plan and profile of any such street as required by Section 16.32.060 must accompany said final tract or final parcel map. Private streets shall be shown on the maps as separate lots or parcels.
B. Where the subdivider files a final tract map or final parcel map, private streets may, with the approval of the city engineer, and advisory agency, deviate from the requirements prescribed by this title for public streets provided that:
    1. With the submittal of the tentative map, the subdivider makes a specific request for each deviation, with a citation to the pertinent ordinance or standard requirement from which a deviation is requested.
    2. Cross sections and other appropriate details are shown on the tentative map for all the requested deviations.

16.28.120 Street and alley arrangement.
The street and alley arrangement shall be such as the advisory agency, in the exercise of its sound discretion, may determine will cause no undue hardship to owners of adjoining property when they subdivide their land, and adequate and convenient access to adjoining property shall be required. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.28.130 Street names.
Each street or way which is to be dedicated, which is a continuation of, or approximately the continuation of, any existing dedicated street or way shall be shown on the tentative map and shall be given the same name as such existing street or way. The proposed name of each other street or way shall be shown on the tentative map and submitted to the planning director for approval, and if such name is not a duplication of, or so nearly the same as to cause confusion with, the name of any existing street or way located in the city, or in close proximity thereto, and if such name is appropriate for a street name, such name shall be approved. When any such street or way forms a portion of any proposed street or way ordered by the city council to be surveyed, opened, widened or improved, and in such order a name therefor is assigned or designated, the name of such street or way shown on the map shall be the same as the name contained in said order.

The widths of all easements and sufficient ties thereto definitely to locate the same with respect to the subdivision must be shown. All easements must be clearly labeled and identified; if an easement shown on the map is already of record, its recorded reference must be given. If an easement is being dedicated by the map, it shall be set out in the owner’s certificate of dedication. All notes and figures pertaining to easements shall be considerably smaller and lighter than those relating to the subdivision itself.
C. The city may require the subdivider to remove any trees, brush, or other obstructions lying within an easement or right-of-way. The subdivider shall be required to remove or trim trees or brush lying within the easements or rights-of-way over which utilities are to be constructed, when such trees or brush interfere with the construction of such utility lines. Such work shall be completed in a manner satisfactory to the utilities concerned. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.28.150 Removal of obstructions—Drainage.

Obstructions shall be relocated and/or removed as provided below. This shall include, but is not limited to, the quitclaim or subordination of rights to the city by all interest and easement holders having the right to place facilities or otherwise obstruct the free use of the road right-of-way or alternative arrangement acceptable to the city engineer.
    1. All obstructions shall be removed from the streets, roadways or rights-of-way dedicated in the final map of a subdivision or which are deeded to the city in connection therewith which in the determination of the city engineer interfere with the use thereof or constitute a dangerous or hazardous condition to the traveling public.
    2. All obstructions shall be removed which are located within existing county, state, or city streets or roadways lying immediately adjacent to streets, roadways or rights-of-way which are dedicated in the final subdivision map or which are deeded by the subdivider to the city in connection therewith and which obstructions, in the determination of the city engineer, interfere with the use of said existing county, state or city streets or roadways, or constitute a dangerous or hazardous condition to the traveling public.

Where it is found to be necessary for orderly development, residential lots having side yards adjacent to collector or arterial streets shall be required to install a six­foot-high masonry wall (the height shall be measured from whichever side of the wall the adjacent finished grade is higher) with landscaping (on the exterior side) installed by the subdivider adjacent to the side property line or, where the wall and landscaping are to be maintained by a homeowners association or maintenance district, installed within the street right-of-way and additional landscape easement or adjacent common lot. Alternate wall and landscape concepts may be approved in areas where, in the opinion of the advisory agency, topographic or other physical conditions make strict adherence to this criteria undesirable. Conceptual wall and landscape plans shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with adopted resolutions prior to filing of any final tract or final parcel map.
J. Landscape Walls Exceeding Four Feet Within Front Yard Setback. The planning director, in accordance with adopted resolutions, or the advisory agency may permit walls exceeding four feet in height within the front yard setback area of a residential lot when approved as part of a conceptual wall and landscape plan approved in conjunction with a subdivision.
K. Lots Abutting Commercial Uses. Where it is found to be necessary for orderly development, residential lots which share a common property line with office, commercial or industrial zoning or land use designations shall be separated by a masonry block wall along said property line a minimum of six feet but not exceeding eight feet in height as measured from highest adjacent finished grade. Timing of said wall installation to be determined by the advisory agency.
L. Lots Abutting Park Sites, Drilling Islands, Oil Well Sites, and Canals. Where it is found to be necessary for orderly development, any lot which shares a common property line with a lot designed to serve as a park site, drilling island, oil well site or canal shall be separated by a masonry block wall, along said property line a minimum of six feet but not exceeding eight feet in height as measured from highest adjacent finished grade. Timing of said wall installation to be determined by the advisory agency.
M. Lot Numbers. Lot numbers shall begin with the numeral 1 and shall continue consecutively through the tract, with no omissions or duplications, and no block number shall be used. Letters shall be used to designate non-buildable lots.
N. Lot Dimensions. Dimensions of all lot lines shall be shown. No ditto marks shall be used on any final tract or final parcel map. All maps shall show the area of each irregular (nonrectangular) lot.
O. Reduction of Minimum Standards. The advisory agency may permit a reduction in minimum standards including lot area, width, frontage and/or depth pursuant to the provisions in either Chapter 16.36 or 17.52 or density bonus provisions of the municipal code. Reduction of minimum standards may also be allowed as follows:
    1. The advisory agency may permit a five percent reduction of lot area, width, frontage and/or depth for not more than five percent of the lots in a subdivision if it makes the following findings:
        a. The proposed subdivision is within the density range depicted for the property in the general plan.
        b. The proposed subdivision is consistent with the purposes and intent of the subdivision ordinance and zoning ordinance.
        c. The applicant has provided justification for the proposed reduction based on sound engineering practices or subdivision design features.
    2. A reduction in lot width, depth and frontage in a subdivision may be permitted by the advisory agency if it makes the following findings:
        a. The minimum lot area complies with zoning.
        b. The applicant has demonstrated that the development will not require a modification for the reduction of the required front, rear, or side yard setbacks on any lot within the subdivision.
        c. The applicant has demonstrated that the reduction is required due to physical constraints, the application of city engineering standards, and a lack of design alternatives.
    3. If the project site is zoned for multiple-family dwellings, the advisory agency may permit a reduction of lot area for one-family dwellings (as provided for in Section 17.14.070(B)) in a subdivision if it makes the following findings:
        a. The proposed subdivision is within the density range depicted for the property in the general plan.
        b. The subdivision is planned to provide a balanced housing stock within a defined area.
        c. The subdivision does not result in an unjustified concentration of substandard lots within a defined area.
        d. The applicant has demonstrated that the development will not require a modification for the reduction of the required front, rear, or side-yard setbacks on any lot within the subdivision.
        e. The proposed development offers elements unique to the project that justify the reduction in lot area standards such as, but not limited to, one or more of the following:
            i. Two percent of the gross acreage of subdivision is designed as active recreational area.
            Active recreational area as selected by the applicant shall include, but is not limited to: court sports, field sports, pool areas, indoor recreational facilities, tot lots, playground apparatus areas, and par course facilities. Also included are trails with a paved surface separate from otherwise required improvements (i.e., roads, sidewalks, trails) which are interior or exterior to the subdivision and which connect to public parks, multi-use trails or the Kern River adjacent to or within a reasonable distance from the subdivision.
            The active recreational area claimed as a unique element shall include no more than twenty percent of its total area dedicated to passive uses (excluding industry recommended clear space setbacks for separation of apparatus, sport fields and courts).
            ii. Two and one-half percent of the gross acreage of subdivision is designed as combination recreational area.
            Combination recreational area includes active recreational area and passive recreational area as selected by the applicant when more than twenty percent of the area claimed for unique element credit is dedicated to passive recreational area (excluding industry recommended clear space setbacks for separation of apparatus, sport fields and courts).
            Passive recreational area is open space such as open turf and tree areas, park-like landscaped areas, informal open play areas and picnic/BBQ area.
            Unique element credit for active or combination recreational areas shall not be allotted for any individually owned open space, landscape areas otherwise required by city ordinances or the State Map Act (river access), or natural and landscaped areas required for mitigation of environmental impacts.
            iii. Subdivision design features such as pedestrian oriented parkways providing one twenty-four-inch box size tree per lot (species subject to city parks department approval) installed within a landscaped parkway between the street and sidewalk for all streets within the interior of the subdivision and maintained by the individual lot owners.
            iv. Subdivisions less than ten gross acres in size may pay park land in-lieu fees at three acres per one thousand population.

C. Supplemental Improvements—Reimbursement Agreements. 
    1. The subdivider of a subdivision for which a final tract map or final parcel map is required may be required to install improvements for the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity or number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition precedent to the approval of a tentative subdivision map and thereafter to dedicate such improvements to the public.
    2. In the event such supplemental improvements are required by the advisory agency as authorized in this subsection, the city shall enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider, upon collection of moneys from owners of other property benefited thereby and within a specified time period, for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements.
    3. In order to pay the costs as required by the reimbursement agreement, the city may:
        a. Collect from other persons, including public agencies, using such improvements for the benefit of real property not within the subdivision, a reasonable charge for such use;
        b. Contribute to the subdivider that part of the cost of the improvements that is attributable to the benefit of real property outside the subdivision and levy a charge upon the real property benefited to reimburse the city for such cost together with interest thereon, if any, paid to the subdivider;
        c. Establish and maintain local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefited.
D. Drainage Facilities—Payment of Fees Required.

Such postponement may occur until further subdivision of the property.
E. Sewer Facilities—Payment of Fees Required. Prior to approval of any development entitlement including, but not limited to, any general plan land use designation amendment, rezoning, the filing of any final map or parcel map, the granting of a conditional use permit, or after the cancellation of a Williamson Act contract within an assessment district, the subdivider/property owner shall pay or cause to be paid any fees for defraying the actual or estimated costs of constructing planned sanitary sewer facilities for local sanitary sewer areas pursuant to sanitary sewer plans adopted by the council, or connection to sanitary sewer facilities therefor in accordance with Article 5 of Chapter 4 of Division 2 of Title 7 of the California Government Code Section 66483 et seq.

The primary purpose of the major thoroughfares is to carry through traffic and provide a network connecting to the state highway system.
        b. A public hearing pursuant to Government Code Section 66484(a)(2) and (3) shall be held by the council for each area benefited, and the boundaries of each such area, costs, and method of fee apportionment shall be set forth in a resolution to be adopted by the council.
        c. Payment of fees shall not be required unless the major thoroughfares are in addition to, or a reconstruction of, any existing major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit.
        d. Payment of fees shall not be required unless the planned bridge facility is an original bridge serving the area or an addition to any existing bridge facility serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit. The fees shall not be expanded to reimburse the cost of existing bridge facility construction.
        e. The city clerk shall receive written protests and endorse on each protest the date and time it was filed.
            i. No protest received after the time fixed for the public hearing shall be timely;
            ii. If a written protest is filed by owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented to less than one-half of that to be benefited, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the council shall not, for one year from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement or acquisition under the provisions of this section;
            iii. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner protesting, in writing, at any time prior to the conclusion of a public hearing held pursuant to subsection (F)(2)(b) of this section;
            iv. If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this section to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the council may commence new proceedings not including any part of the improvement or acquisition so protested against. Nothing in this section prohibits the council, within that one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the improvement so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited are in favor of going forward with that portion of the improvement or acquisition.
    3. Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund. A fund shall be established for each planned bridge facility project or each planned major thoroughfare project. If the benefit area is one in which more than one bridge is required to be constructed, a fund may be so established covering all of the bridge projects in the benefit area. Money in the fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the improvement serving the area to be benefited and from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the city for the cost of constructing the improvement.

All boundary monuments shall be in place prior to recordation of the map. The city engineer may, by a field survey, satisfy him or herself that all monuments actually exist and that their positions are correctly shown. Depth of boundary monuments shall be not less than six inches or more than thirty inches.
    3. Set two-inch by two-inch by twelve-inch redwood stakes with tag, iron rod with cap or iron pipe with cap and properly tagged at all angle points and beginning and ending of all curves on the boundary of each lot or parcel, which angle point is not covered in subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section. For front lot or parcel corners, reference points, consisting of “penny” tags epoxied in place together with chisel marks on the top of curbs, may be substituted for the required redwood stake, iron rod or iron pipe. For rear lot corners of double-frontage lots, reference points, consisting of concrete nails and tags mounted on the rear masonry wall, on the lot side, at a visible elevation, may be substituted for the required redwood stake, iron rod or iron pipe.
    4. When any of the above-described boundary points fall in a concrete sidewalk, curb, wall, coping, etc., such points shall be marked with a concrete nail and tag.
    5. All monuments in subsections (B)(1) and (2) of this section shall be so set as to insure an unobstructed sight between adjacent monuments, whenever feasible, and in no case shall the distance between monuments exceed two thousand seven hundred feet, unless prior approval is obtained from the city engineer.
    6. All monuments shall be permanently marked with the certificate number of the engineer or surveyor setting it, preceded by the letters R.C.E. or L.S. respectively, as the case may be.
    7. The character, type and position of all monuments and encasements shall be noted on the final map. If a monument is replaced, indicate type and condition of monument found and the date of replacement.
    8. A traverse of the boundaries of the map and of all the lots, or parcels, and blocks must close within a limit of error not in excess of one foot in twenty thousand feet.
    9. All distances must be expressed on the map to the nearest one one-hundredth of one foot.

The city engineer may review the report and may require additional information or reject the report if it is found to be incomplete, inaccurate or unsatisfactory. Such soils report and grading plan shall be prepared by a civil engineer registered in this state, who shall recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where the soils problem exists.
B. If the soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soils investigation of each lot or parcel in the subdivision may be required by the city engineer. Such soils investigation shall recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where the soils problems exist.
C. If the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of rocks or liquids containing deleterious chemicals which, if not corrected, could cause construction materials such as concrete, steel and ductile or cast iron to corrode or deteriorate, a soils investigation of each potentially affected lot in the subdivision may be required.
D. The city may approve the subdivision or portion thereof where soils problems described in subsections B. and C. of this section exist if it is determined that the recommended action is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure to be constructed, and as a condition to the issuance of any building permit may require that the approved recommended action be incorporated in the construction of each structure. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.44.020 Waiver of preliminary soil report and/or grading plan.

B. If the city engineer or building director requires a preliminary soils report and/or grading plan for subdivisions for which a final parcel map is required, the soils report and/or grading plan may be deferred by the advisory agency as a requirement of the approval of the tentative parcel map and recordation of the final parcel map until such time as a building permit application is filed. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

16.44.030 Final soils report.
A. Grading shall be performed in accordance with the approved grading plan and the preliminary soils report and compaction tests shall be submitted to the city’s building director for each lot in a subdivision prior to recordation of the final map, except as the building director may determine that no public interest would be served thereby.
B. When any soils investigation has indicated any soil problems and a civil engineer has recommended the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where the soils problems exist, the final map or parcel map may be approved for recording subject to the following condition: The building director shall not approve any building permit on any lot within any new subdivision until a final soils report has been submitted to him showing that all corrective action set forth in the preliminary soils report and report of the soils investigation has been completed and until the civil engineer has certified that all corrective action likely to prevent any structural damage to any structure proposed to be constructed in the area where the soils problems exist, has been taken and completed to his satisfaction. (Ord. 3515 § 1, 1993)

    4. Landscape Plan. The applicant shall provide a landscape plan as set forth in Chapter 17.61 which demonstrates the project complies with the requirements of that chapter and/or landscaping requirements set out in the zoning ordinance or specific plans for that area;
    5. Environmental Information. The applicant shall provide such information as may be required by the planning director in satisfaction of the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA);
    6. Additional Information. The applicant shall provide any other information as required by the planning director that is necessary to ensure that the project can be adequately evaluated;
    7. Fees. The applicant shall pay a fee not to exceed the cost of processing and reviewing the plan as set forth in Chapter 3.70.
B. Procedure. 
    1. Acceptance. Applications shall be submitted to the planning director. Within thirty days, the planning director shall determine whether the application is complete and conforms to these requirements. No application shall be deemed complete unless the project is consistent with the general plan and zoning ordinance as implemented by adopted regulations of the city. If the application does not conform to the requirements of this chapter or is inconsistent with the general plan or zoning regulations, the planning director shall notify the applicant what additional requirements or applications may be necessary to comply with this section. If the application is complete, he/she shall accept it for processing.
    2. Referral and Review. After the application is deemed complete, the planning director shall transmit one copy of the application to the site plan review committee which is established and shall consist of the planning director, building director, fire chief and public works director, or their designated representatives. The site plan review committee shall review and provide comments on such application to the planning director.
    3. Environmental Review. The planning director shall conduct CEQA review pursuant to CEQA implementation guidelines and state law if the project is subject to CEQA.
    4. Approval. After considering the recommendations from the site plan review committee and the planning director, and after approving any necessary CEQA documents, the development services director may approve, conditionally approve or deny the site plan. The development services director may impose time limits within which specified improvements shall be installed. Failure to complete installation of such improvements within the specified time limit shall void both the site plan approval and any building permit issued. A site plan may only be denied if the proposed project does not comply with city codes, standards or policies, or CEQA. The action of the development services director approving or denying site plan, if not appealed as provided hereinafter, shall be final.
    5. Building Permit Review. Upon submittal by the applicant for a building permit for a project for which site plan approval has been given, the building director will transmit a copy of the construction plans to the site plan review committee who will review the plans for compliance with the conditions, requirements and mitigation measures imposed on the site plan. If the committee determines the applicant has not complied with one or more of the applicable codes, standards, mitigation measures or other conditions imposed by the development services director, the planning director shall notify the applicant in writing that the plans will be suspended from further processing until such compliance is satisfied. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the building director until all conditions, requirements and mitigation measures imposed on the site plan have been accomplished.
    6. Commencement of Construction. No development or construction, including grading, for which site plan approval is required, may begin until the process set forth in this chapter has been completed, the time period for appeal has expired, and all other permits and licenses required for the project to commence have been obtained.
C. Revisions to Applications. 
    1. Revisions Prior to Decision. The applicant may submit revisions to the site plan application at any time before the site plan is approved or denied. The planning director may determine that the revisions require study by the staff or comment by one or more city departments and/or other public agencies, or further CEQA review, and may therefore reprocess the application as necessary, including recirculating any environmental document for public comment.
    2. Revisions After Denial of the Site Plan. The applicant may resubmit the proposal with revisions together with any required processing fees. Such resubmittal shall be acted upon in the same manner as the original application.
    3. Revisions After Approval of the Site Plan. At any time after approval, but before the approved site plan expires, the applicant may submit revisions to the plan. Such revisions shall be acted upon in the same manner as the original application; provided, however, minor revisions resulting from physical obstacles, compliance with conditions or mitigation measures, or other comparable constraints may be approved by the planning director. Revisions as provided in this subsection shall not extend the time the site plan expires.
D. Expiration of Site Plan. Approved site plans shall expire unless building permits have been issued on the project, or on projects not requiring a building permit construction has commenced on-site, within two years of the date of approval and the entire project completed not more than five years from the date of approval of the site plan. Time requirements may be extended for a period of one year by the planning director through resubmittal of final plans for check against current code requirements and/or written justification for the requested extension. No fees will be levied for such a compliance check and extension. Changes to the plans originally approved for purposes other than code requirements shall require an application for revisions pursuant to this chapter. Upon expiration of the building permit, a new site plan approval must be obtained. In any event, such site plan shall expire upon the rezoning of the site following approval of the site plan unless the proposed use is a permitted use in the subsequent zone.
E. Appeal Procedure. 
    1. Any person not satisfied with the decision of the development services director may, within ten days of the date of that decision, appeal to the city planning commission by filing a written notice of appeal and payment of fees with the planning director setting forth the precise basis and issues on appeal and requesting a hearing thereon. The planning commission shall, as soon as possible, hold a noticed public hearing thereon. Only appeals of issues subject to review by the planning commission will be accepted for filing.
    2. Notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be mailed or delivered at least ten days prior to the hearing to the owner of the subject real property, the owner’s duly authorized agent, the project applicant, and the appellant. Notice shall also be mailed to every person filing with the planning director a written request for notice, and those within the noticed area if the site plan was initially subject to a public hearing.
    3. Review by the planning commission of an appealed site plan is limited to a determination of whether or not an adopted development standard, zoning regulation, or policy applied or not applied to the project was done consistent with authority granted by city ordinance. No authority is granted to add, delete, change or modify adopted standards, regulations or policies except as required to comply with conditions necessary to mitigate unavoidable environmental impacts. After hearing the appeal, the planning commission may deny, grant or partially grant the appeal by directing changes to the project or to the CEQA document adopted or to the mitigation measures as necessitated by their findings regarding the issues appealed. All findings, CEQA determinations and conditions made by the development services director not appealed to the planning commission shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be modified by the planning commission. The decision by the planning commission shall be final.
    4. Any person not satisfied with the decision of the planning commission may, within ten days of the date of that decision, appeal to the city council. All procedures for notice, review of the appeal, and the holding of the public hearing within subsection E shall also apply to the city council.
    5. Failure to file an appeal within the time period prescribed therefor shall be deemed a waiver of the right of appeal. (Ord. 4939 § 9, 2018; Ord. 4714 § 1, 2012; Ord. 3835 § 6, 1998)

17.08.090 Overlooks into residential rear yards.
A. The intent of this section is to provide a reasonable degree of privacy to and screening of residential rear yards adjacent to multistory office, commercial, industrial, apartment or condominium structures. Screening shall only apply to the rear yard of the impacted residential property, being defined as a three-dimensional area measured horizontally between the rear property line and the residential structure, and measured vertically between the grade of the residential structure’s foundation and a plane five feet above such grade. This section does not intend to provide a total screening of the affected yard area, or the affected residence’s building walls and windows.
B. Screening shall apply to overlooks from all windows, balconies, and decks from the second floor and above, in office, commercial, industrial, apartment or condominium structures containing three or more units that are within one hundred fifty feet of property zoned for R-1, R-S, R-S-1A, E, MH, PUD projects and condominium projects of a single-family character with private rear yards. This section shall not apply to overlooks from buildings to yards within the same planned unit development projects.
C. If a building subject to this section begins construction and the property within one hundred fifty feet of it in the above cited residential zones is vacant, then it shall not be required to screen that vacant property from its view.
D. Where a project has a severe overlook problem because of topography, height of structure or other unusual conditions, the building and planning directors may require a landscape plan to provide a long term screening solution (effective within five years) within three hundred feet of property zoned R-1, R-S, R-S-1A, E, MH, PUD projects and condominium projects of a single-family character with private rear yards.
E. Where a project falls under the provisions of this section, a conceptual screening plan shall be submitted with the site plan review application. Where possible, the screening plan shall incorporate the use of landscaping.
F. The decision as to what is a reasonable degree of privacy and a reasonable plan to accomplish such privacy shall be determined by the building and planning directors. In making such decision, the directors shall consider the following factors:
    1. Topography and zoning of neighboring properties;
    2. Design alternatives;
    3. Cost;
    4. Timing of development;
    5. Building code and fire safety regulations;
    6. Other factors determined to be significant by the directors.
G. Methods which may be used to accomplish screening include, but are not limited to:
    1. No windows, balconies or decks facing the affected residential property;
    2. Windows with sills a minimum of five feet above the floor;
    3. Translucent glass;
    4. Wing walls;
    5. Louvers appropriately directed;
    6. Landscaping;
    7. Awnings when used as an interim screening in connection with a permanent landscaping plan;
    8. Other design solutions which accomplish essentially the same results as determined by the directors;
    9. Separation of the multistory building from the closest portion of the yard being protected by a minimum distance of one hundred fifty feet measured horizontally. (Ord. 3835 § 6, 1998)

17.08.100 Dwellings to face access other than alley.
A. Except where otherwise provided for in this title, every dwelling shall face or have frontage upon a street or permanent means of access to a street by way of a public or private easement of passageway other than an alley.
B. Such easements shall be not less than ten feet in width. (Prior code § 17.52.100)

17.08.110 Height of buildings—Roof structures, chimneys and towers.
A. No penthouses or roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans or similar equipment; towers, steeples, roof signs or other structures shall exceed the height limit provided in this title.
B. Flagpoles, public utility poles and lines, chimneys and smokestacks may extend not more than thirty feet above the height limit provided in this title; provided, that the same may be safely erected and maintained at such height in view of the surrounding conditions and circumstances. Wireless telecommunication facilities, including antennas, satellite dish antennas, and towers shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.59. (Ord. 4231 § 7, 2005; prior code § 17.52.110)

17.08.120 Yard requirements when portion of other use is used as dwelling.
Where a portion of a building used for dwelling purposes is located above another portion of a building having another type of use in zones other than R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4 zones, the rear and side yards for the floors occupied for dwelling purposes shall comply with the provisions of the R-4 zone. (Prior code § 17.52.120)

17.08.125 Street setback exceptions—Front and side yard.
Where more than fifty percent of the lots along the same side of a street within the same block contains existing buildings having setbacks from the street less than the required minimum specified by the zone district in which the buildings are located, any new building may be set back a distance equal to the average setback of the existing buildings. However, in no instances, shall any building be required to be located more than the minimum setback specified by the zone district. (Ord. 4753 § 1, 2013; Ord. 3463 § 1, 1992; Ord. 2696 § 2, 1982)

17.08.130 Accessory buildings.
A. Accessory buildings or structures may be located within an interior side or rear yard area in any residential zone district or project of a residential nature provided they do not exceed a height of seven feet and/or an area of one hundred twenty square feet.

C. Accessory buildings and structures in commercial and industrial zone districts shall be subject to all development standards of that zone district.
D. No accessory buildings or structures shall be located within any required street side yard or front yard area. Fountains, ponds and other decorative water features, and garden/art decorations are exempt from this subsection provided that they do not exceed a height of six feet. Flag-poles are also exempt and are subject to the regulations in subsection B of Section 17.08.110. (Ord. 4680 § 1, 2012; Ord. 3964 § 5, 2000; Ord. 2696 § 3, 1982; prior code § 17.52.130)

17.08.140 Design standards for large retail developments.
A. Purpose. Bakersfield is concerned with the future design of its commercial areas, specifically with the growth of large retail developments that include big box stores. At the same time, it is important to encourage economic development. These standards help mitigate unwanted design, while encouraging developers to incorporate good community architecture that enhances the city’s character and quality of life. In addition to the requirements herein, all landscaping projects shall adhere to that certain Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance (MWELO) as adopted in California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 2.7 as adopted by the state.
B. Applicability. 
    1. These standards shall apply to large retail developments throughout the city within all commercial zone districts, and all nonresidential zones where the development contains retail commercial components, including but not limited to planned unit development zones, industrial zones, and recreation/open space zones. These standards also apply to all specific plan areas unless the plan has standards that are more restrictive. In Northeast Bakersfield, the building design standards in subsection C of this section shall apply to all commercial and industrial projects, regardless of size, which are subject to site plan review.
    2. These standards are in addition to any other development requirements as required by this title, including but not limited to zone district regulations, signs, parking, landscaping, and accessory uses.
    3. Expansion to Existing Large Retail Developments. 
        a. An addition to an existing large retail development that was initially subject to these standards shall be required to comply with the requirements of this section.
        b. An addition to an existing large retail development that was not previously subject to the requirements of this section is required to comply with this section if the gross floor area of such establishment as a single expansion or cumulatively since the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section is increased by fifty percent or more, or the addition is such that it creates a large retail development and that addition increases the gross floor area of such building by fifty percent or more as a single expansion or cumulatively since the adoption of the ordinance codified in this section.
    4. Reference may be made in this subsection to specific geographic areas, which are defined as follows:
        a. Northeast Bakersfield—includes all lands east of Fairfax Road (and any northern extension thereof) and north of the Union Pacific Railroad that parallels Edison Highway.
C. Building Design Standards. 
    1. Exterior building walls and facades over one hundred feet in length shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses with a depth of at least three percent of the length of the facade and extending along at least twenty percent of the length of the facade. No facade shall have an uninterrupted length of flat wall that exceeds one hundred horizontal feet. Facades that face public streets shall include arcades, display windows, entry areas, or other such permanent features along no less than sixty percent of their horizontal length.
    [IMAGE: <17.08.140_001.png>]
[IMAGE: <17.08.140_002.png>]
    2. All building facades must include no less than three of the following elements. At least one of the elements (subsection (C)(2)(a), (C)(2)(b) or (C)(2)(c) of this section), shall occur horizontally. All elements shall occur at intervals of no more than thirty feet, either horizontally or vertically.
        a. Color change;
        b. Texture change;
        c. Material change;
        d. An expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane no less than twelve inches in width, such as an offset, reveal or projecting rib, or other architecturally appropriate feature.
        [IMAGE: <17.08.140_003.png>]
    3. Where large retail developments contain smaller additional, separately owned stores that occupy less than twenty-five thousand square feet of gross floor area with separate, exterior customer entrances, the street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than sixty percent of the horizontal length of the building of such additional stores. Windows shall be recessed and include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing.
    4. In multiple building developments, each individual building shall include prominent architectural characteristics shared by all buildings in the center so that the development forms a cohesive sense of place.
    5. Rooflines shall be varied with a change in height every one hundred linear feet of the building length. Parapets, mansard roofs, gable roofs, hip roofs, or dormers shall be used to conceal flat roofs and roof top equipment from public view. Alternating lengths and designs of the roofline are acceptable. If parapets are used, they shall not at any point exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. All parapets shall feature three-dimensional cornice treatment.
    [IMAGE: <17.08.140_004.png>]
    6. Exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including, but not limited to, brick, sandstone, and other native stone, manufactured stone (realistic), wood, glass, decorative metal elements, and tinted/textured concrete masonry units, including stucco and synthetic stucco-type materials.
        a. For projects in Northeast Bakersfield, building materials consisting of river rock, native stone, cobblestone, ledge stone, rough-sawn timbers, and logs, either as a single element or combination thereof, shall be used as the predominate theme throughout the project area.
    7. Primary facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle colors over primary, bold or dramatic colors. The use of reflective metallic or fluorescent colors is discouraged. However, building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors. Paint applied over brick, stone and concrete is prohibited.
        a. For projects in Northeast Bakersfield, the predominate color palette shall consist of earth and natural toned colors that blend with the surrounding area. A variety of these colors is encouraged to allow individuality but maintain a cohesive sense of place for the entire center.
    8. Finished exterior building materials shall not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels or prefabricated steel panels.
    9. Entryways. 
        a. At least two sides of a large retail development shall feature customer entrances. The two required sides shall be those planned to have the highest level of public pedestrian activity.

A. Additional floor area may be permitted by the planning director above the base floor area ratio when the project includes one or more of the following public benefit features:
    1. Open Space, Atrium, Plaza, or Garden Available to the Public. 
        a. Intent. These areas are intended to provide public open space which provides quiet retreats from surrounding activity in the intensely developed areas of downtown or a center. While relatively small, they should be flexible in design to accommodate passive recreational activities, as well as allow events and public gatherings. They should also be strategically located to denote important places, create a focus for surrounding development, and increase light and air at the street level. Weather protected areas can serve to function as an interior park to give the public relief from extreme weather conditions.
        b. Bonus Area. In order to be eligible for a bonus, the open space area shall be a minimum of three thousand square feet in size, with a maximum bonus area of ten thousand square feet. The area shall be one continuous space, with elements such as but not limited to landscaping, fountains, seating, and public art.
        c. The open space area shall be directly accessible from a public sidewalk with accessibility to the handicapped meeting state handicapped requirements.
        d. Permanent art may be incorporated as part of the open areas as set forth in this subsection.
        e. Kiosks, displays, art exhibits, and retail vendors are permitted provided they are portable in nature and use of the open area by the public is not precluded. The total area occupied by such uses shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the total open area.
        f. Interior pedestrian lighting shall be provided.
        g. Directory or directional signs may be permitted pursuant to Chapter 17.60.
    2. Sculptured Building Tops. 
        a. Intent. Sculptured building tops are intended to provide visual interest and variety in the downtown or center skyline. They have the greatest impact in the downtown area where the tallest buildings are permitted. A sculptured building top which modifies the silhouette of a building by reducing the area of the top floors, reduces the overall bulk of the building to produce a more interesting building form. As the building increases in height, its upper portion should become more slender and ornamental. Mechanical equipment on the roof would be enclosed and integrated into the design of the building.
        b. Bonus Area. The bonus area shall be the sum of all reductions on qualifying floors plus an automatic ten thousand square foot reduction. The reduced floor area shall only occur within the upper thirty percent of the total occupied building height. The maximum reduced floor area eligible for a bonus shall be thirty thousand square feet.
    3. Public Art Work. 
        a. Intent. There is a broad view of what constitutes art, and it is desired to encourage a high-quality, imaginative interpretation of the various media. Works of art may be merely decorative, or both decorative and functional. Over time, new materials and art forms may be developed. Therefore, art work may include, but is not limited to two or three dimensional works in all media such as oil or acrylic on canvas, textiles, photography, ceramics, wood, paper, metal, stone, etc. Art work may also include fountains, mobiles, special wall or paving surface, mosaics, murals, landscaping elements, and other decorative features. Interdisciplinary projects and collaborations are encouraged, as are works involving sound, touch and other senses.
        b. Bonus Area. The maximum bonus area shall be five thousand square feet. The city council shall adopt parameters that define public art work and criteria that will determine the amount of bonus area that may be allowed by the planning director.
        c. Art work shall be an integral part of the design of the building or public open space, and shall be compatible in bulk, scale, design, texture, color, and shape with the space in which it is located. It shall be located so that it is clearly visible to people using the public space, and whenever possible, visible from the street.
        d. The setting for art work shall be designed in such a way as to provide comfort and amenity, and accommodate people viewing it by incorporating such features as steps, ledges, benches and other seating, or provide rails or other architectural features to lean against.
        e. The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all art features for the life of the building or open space.
    4. Voluntary Building Setback. 
        a. Intent. Voluntary building setbacks are intended to expand the landscaped area along streets to encourage additional open space along public streets that link large open space areas, parks and plazas.
        b. Bonus Area. The maximum bonus area shall be ten feet times the street frontage along the street the additional setback is provided.
        c. The additional setback area shall provide ample room for landscaping that will complement existing street landscaping and the building.
        d. The minimum additional setback shall be five feet in order to count as bonus area for a minimum continuous distance of sixty feet, or the entire frontage of the lot the building is located if the lot is less than sixty feet in width.
    5. Overhead Weather Protection. 
        a. Intent. Overhead weather protection is intended to improve pedestrian comfort along pedestrian routes.
        b. Bonus Area. All area protected.
        c. Overhead protections shall be permanent and nonretractable with a minimum protection width of six feet.
        d. At least one-half of the overhead protections shall be over the public sidewalk or walkway. An encroachment permit shall be obtained from the public works department for any overhead protection over public right-of-way.
        e. No covering shall extend more than ten feet or to a point within two feet from the curb flow line, whichever is less. The entire area under the weather protection shall be unobstructed by structural elements such as columns.
        f. The lower edge of the overhead protection shall be a minimum of eight feet and a maximum of twelve feet above the sidewalk.
        g. The minimum length of the overhead protection shall be sixty feet or if less, the entire length of the building in order to qualify for bonus area.
    6. Day Care Facilities (Children and Adult). 
        a. Intent. Day care facilities provide a safe and supportive environment for a wide range of educational, social and health related services for both children and adults. Encouraging the integration of these facilities into mixed use developments allow these services to be near both homes and workplaces helping caregivers better manage quality time at both work and home. The location of these facilities near employment centers and residential neighborhoods can also contribute to reducing automobile congestion, air pollution, and enhance the ability to blend civic, volunteer and work interests into sustainable communities.
        b. Bonus Area. The entire area devoted for such use to a maximum floor area of twenty thousand square feet.
        c. The planning director must approve CC&Rs (conditions, covenants and restrictions), contract, agreement or other such document for the establishment and continued operation for only those day care facilities requesting bonus area as a public benefit feature under the provisions of this chapter. This document shall be recorded to assure that obligations benefiting the building extend to its future owners.
B. General Conditions for Public Benefit Features. 
    1. Public benefit features shall be installed at the same time as the additional bonus area. The planning director may extend the time allowed when installation is not feasible due to construction scheduling or other good cause; however, final occupancy shall not be issued until all features have been provided.
    2. Public benefit features shall remain for the life of the building which includes the additional floor area. A feature may only be diminished or discontinued if the additional floor area allowed in return for the specific feature is permanently removed, or by replacing it with another public benefit feature of at least the equivalent value as approved by the planning director.
    3. Changes in the design, function or architectural features in a public benefit feature shall be approved by the planning director.
    4. Unless otherwise stated in the specific conditions for the public benefit feature the property owner shall be responsible for all elements of maintenance of an approved public benefit feature. (Ord. 4311 § 4, 2006; Ord. 3631 § 2, 1995)

17.25.100 Minimum lot area.
There shall be no lot minimum requirement in a C-B zone. (Ord. 3631 § 2, 1995)

    5. Top deck of a parking structure if it is not covered by a roof. (Ord. 4312 § 6, 2006; Ord. 3631 § 4, 1995)

17.26.090 Public benefit features.
A. Additional floor area may be permitted by the planning director above the base floor area ratio when the project includes one or more of the following public benefit features:
    1. Open Space, Atrium, Plaza, or Garden Available to the Public. 
        a. Intent. These areas are intended to provide public open space which provides quiet retreats from surrounding activity in the intensely developed areas of downtown or a center. While relatively small, they should be flexible in design to accommodate passive recreational activities, as well as allow events and public gatherings. They should also be strategically located to denote important places, create a focus for surrounding development, and increase light and air at the street level. Weather protected areas can serve to function as an interior park to give the public relief from extreme weather conditions.
        b. Bonus Area. In order to be eligible for a bonus, the open space area shall be a minimum of three thousand square feet in size, with a maximum bonus area of ten thousand square feet. The area shall be one continuous space, with elements such as but not limited to landscaping, fountains, seating, and public art.
        c. The open space area shall be directly accessible from a public sidewalk with accessibility to the handicapped meeting state handicapped requirements.
        d. Permanent art may be incorporated as part of the open areas as set forth in this subsection.
        e. Kiosks, displays, art exhibits, and retail vendors are permitted provided they are portable in nature and use of the open area by the public is not precluded. The total area occupied by such uses shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the total open area.
        f. Interior pedestrian lighting shall be provided.
        g. Directory or directional signs may be permitted pursuant to Chapter 17.60.
    2. Sculptured Building Tops. 
        a. Intent. Sculptured building tops are intended to provide visual interest and variety in the downtown or center skyline. They have the greatest impact in the downtown area where the tallest buildings are permitted. A sculptured building top which modifies the silhouette of a building by reducing the area of the top floors, reduces the overall bulk of the building to produce a more interesting building form. As the building increases in height, its upper portion should become more slender and ornamental. Mechanical equipment on the roof would be enclosed and integrated into the design of the building.
        b. Bonus Area. The bonus area shall be the sum of all reductions on qualifying floors plus an automatic ten thousand square foot reduction. The reduced floor area shall only occur within the upper thirty percent of the total occupied building height. The maximum reduced floor area eligible for a bonus shall be thirty thousand square feet.
    3. Public Art Work. 
        a. Intent. There is a broad view of what constitutes art, and it is desired to encourage a high-quality, imaginative interpretation of the various media. Works of art may be merely decorative, or both decorative and functional. Over time, new materials and art forms may be developed. Therefore, art work may include, but is not limited to, two- or three-dimensional works in all media such as oil or acrylic on canvas, textiles, photography, ceramics, wood, paper, metal, stone, etc. Art work may also include fountains, mobiles, special wall or paving surfaces, mosaics, murals, landscaping elements, and other decorative features. Interdisciplinary projects and collaborations are encouraged, as are works involving sound, touch and other senses.
        b. Bonus Area. The maximum bonus area shall be five thousand square feet. The city council shall adopt parameters that define public art work and criteria that will determine the amount of bonus area that may be allowed by the planning director.
        c. Art work shall be an integral part of the design of the building or public open space, and shall be compatible in bulk, scale, design, texture, color, and shape with the space in which it is located. It shall be located so that it is clearly visible to people using the public space, and whenever possible, visible from the street.
        d. The setting for art work shall be designed in such a way as to provide comfort and amenity, and accommodate people viewing it by incorporating such features as steps, ledges, benches and other seating, or provide rails or other architectural features to lean against.
        e. The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all art features for the life of the building or open space.
    4. Voluntary Building Setback. 
        a. Intent. Voluntary building setbacks are intended to expand the landscaped area along streets to encourage additional open space along public streets that link large open space areas, parks and plazas.
        b. Bonus Area. The maximum bonus area shall be ten feet times the street frontage along the street the additional setback is provided.
        c. The additional setback area shall provide ample room for landscaping that will complement existing street landscaping and the building.
        d. The minimum additional setback shall be five feet in order to count as bonus area for a minimum continuous distance of sixty feet, or the entire frontage of the lot the building is located if the lot is less than sixty feet in width.
    5. Overhead Weather Protection. 
        a. Intent. Overhead weather protection is intended to improve pedestrian comfort along pedestrian routes.
        b. Bonus Area. All area protected.
        c. Overhead protections shall be permanent and nonretractable with a minimum width of protection six feet.
        d. At least one-half of the overhead protection shall be over the sidewalk within the public right-of-way. An encroachment permit shall be obtained from the public works department.
        e. No covering shall extend more than ten feet or to a point within two feet from the curb flow line, whichever is less. The entire area under the weather protection shall be unobstructed by structural elements such as columns.
        f. The lower edge of the overhead protection shall be a minimum of eight feet and a maximum of twelve feet above the sidewalk.
        g. The minimum length of the overhead protection shall be sixty feet or if less, the entire length of the building in order to qualify for bonus area.
    6. Day Care Facilities (Children and Adult). 
        a. Intent. Day care facilities provide a safe and supportive environment for a wide range of educational, social and health related services for both children and adults. Encouraging the integration of these facilities into mixed use developments allow these services to be near both homes and workplaces helping caregivers better manage quality time at both work and home. The location of these facilities near employment centers and residential neighborhoods can also contribute to reducing automobile congestion, air pollution, and enhance the ability to blend civic, volunteer and work interests into sustainable communities.
        b. Bonus Area. The entire area devoted for such use to a maximum floor area of twenty thousand square feet.
        c. The planning director must approve CC&Rs (conditions, covenants and restrictions), contract, agreement or other such document for the establishment and continued operation for only those day care facilities requesting bonus area as a public benefit feature under the provisions of this chapter. This document shall be recorded to assure that obligations benefiting the building extend to its future owners.
B. General Conditions for Public Benefit Features. 
    1. Public benefit features shall be installed at the same time as the additional bonus area. The planning director may extend the time allowed when installation is not feasible due to construction scheduling or other good cause; however, final occupancy shall not be issued until all features have been provided.
    2. Public benefit features shall remain for the life of the building which includes the additional floor area. A feature may only be diminished or discontinued if the additional floor area allowed in return for the specific feature is permanently removed, or by replacing it with another public benefit feature of at least the equivalent value as approved by the planning director.
    3. Changes in the design, function or architectural features in a public benefit feature shall be approved by the planning director.
    4. Unless otherwise stated in the specific conditions for the public benefit feature, the property owner shall be responsible for all elements of maintenance of an approved public benefit feature. (Ord. 4312 § 7, 2006; Ord. 3631 § 4, 1995)

17.26.100 Minimum lot area.
There shall be no lot minimum requirement in a C-C zone; however, all buildings used exclusively for dwelling purposes shall comply with the provisions of the R-4 zone. (Ord. 3631 § 4, 1995)

17.26.110 Distance between buildings on the same lot.

17.52.010 Intent and purpose.
It is recognized that an integrated development provides an opportunity for creative design when flexible regulations are applied. The planned unit development zone is intended to allow for innovative design and diversification in the relationship of various uses, buildings, structures, lot sizes and open space while ensuring substantial compliance with the general plan and the intent of the municipal code. In addition, the development would provide adequate standards necessary to satisfy the requirements of the public health, safety and general welfare. This zone is not to be used to restrict residential development or to compromise other zoning districts that may be more appropriate for a site. Instead, it enables a developer to obtain approval of a specific, detailed plan for a residential neighborhood which ensures that the uniqueness of the project design is preserved. These standards shall be observed without unduly inhibiting the advantages of modern site planning techniques and innovative planning of residential neighborhoods. Land may be classified as being solely within a PUD zone (exclusive zone), or the PUD zone may be used as a combining zone in a R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4 zone to assign a base zone defining allowable uses and ensure future site development will be compatible with surrounding development and/or to recognize unique site characteristics. (Ord. 4009 § 1, 2001; Ord. 3656 § 1, 1995)

17.52.020 Uses permitted.
A. Uses permitted in a PUD zone used as a combining zone are those uses permitted by the base zone with which the PUD zone is combined.
B. Uses for land classified as being within a PUD zone are as follows:
    1. One-family dwellings;
    2. Multiple-family dwellings;
    3. Condominiums;
    4. Cluster developments;
    5. Parks and playgrounds, public and/or private;
    6. Commercial uses, when the planning commission finds that such uses are incidental to, and compatible with, the nature and type of development proposed;
    7. Real estate tract sales offices and model homes pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.10.020(H);
    8. Uses and structures which are incidental or accessory to any of the uses permitted in PUD zones;
    9. Churches;
    10. Schools, public and/or private;
    11. Golf courses, including associated clubhouse and driving range;
    12. Tennis courts, including associated clubhouse;
    13. Swimming pools;
    14. Equestrian facilities;
    15. Hiking, bicycle and equestrian trails;
    16. Open space areas including natural and wildlife areas;
    17. Home occupations, as defined in Section 17.04.330 and in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 17.63.
C. The permitted uses may be allowed in combinations in this zone, provided such use or uses are in harmony with each other and serve to fulfill the function of the planned unit development. (Ord. 4542 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4304 § 1, 2006; Ord. 4009 § 1, 2001; Ord. 3964 § 41, 2000; Ord. 3768 § 4, 1997; Ord. 3656 § 1, 1995)

*Prior code history: prior code §§ 17.47.010—17.47.130

17.54.010 Intent and purpose.
It is recognized that an integrated development provides an opportunity for cohesive design when flexible regulations are applied. The planned commercial development zone is intended to allow for innovative design and diversification in the relationship of various uses, buildings, structures, lot sizes and open spaces while ensuring compliance with the general plan and the intent of the municipal code. In addition, the development would provide adequate improvements and standards necessary to satisfy the requirements of the public health, safety and general welfare. This zone is not to be used to restrict commercial development or to compromise other zoning districts that may be more appropriate for a site. Instead, it enables a developer to obtain approval of a specific, detailed plan for a commercial development which ensures that the uniqueness of the project design being proposed is preserved. Standards shall be observed without unduly inhibiting the advantages of modern site planning techniques and innovative planning of commercial and professional office neighborhoods. Land may be classified as being solely within a PCD zone (exclusive zone), or the PCD zone may be used as a combining zone in a C-O, C-1, C-2, or CC zone to assign a base zone defining allowable uses and ensure future site development will be compatible with surrounding development and/or to recognize unique site characteristics. (Ord. 4305 § 1, 2006; Ord. 4009 § 2, 2001; Ord. 3656 § 2, 1995)

17.54.020 Uses permitted.
A. Uses permitted in a PCD zone used as a combining zone are those uses permitted by the base zone with which the PCD zone is combined.
B. Uses for land classified as being within a PCD zone are as follows:
    1. Any permitted use listed in Chapters 17.20 (C-O), 17.22 (C-1) and 17.24 (C-2). Any use that is conditional in these zones may be requested as part of the initial zone change and approved as conditional uses subject to the findings, conditions and revocation of rights as set forth in Chapter 17.64. Uses which are conditional that are proposed once the PCD zone is effective shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.64.
    2. Uses and structures which are incidental or accessory to any of the uses permitted in PCD zones.
C. The permitted uses may be allowed in combinations in this zone, provided such use or uses are in harmony with each other and serve to fulfill the intent and purposes of the planned commercial development. (Ord. 4542 § 2, 2008; Ord. 4305 § 2, 2006; Ord. 4009 § 2, 2001; Ord. 3752 § 1, 1997; Ord. 3656 § 2, 1995)

17.54.030 Application.
A. When the PCD zone is to be assigned as an exclusive zone classification, the zone change application shall include the following:
    1. A preliminary development plan, drawn to scale, which shall be at the minimum scale indicated and shall include all the information as required for site plan review pursuant to Section 17.08.080(A)(3). The number and type of plans shall be as follows:
        a. Eight copies at scale of all plans submitted;
        b. One copy of each plan reduced to a size of eight and one-half inches by eleven inches;
        c. One color rendition at scale of the site/landscape plan, and elevation plan;
    2. If the proposed project is to be developed in several stages, indicate the anticipated sequence of development;
    3. Show the proposed methods by which the applicant will govern the maintenance and continued protection of the development including any common areas;
    4. Indicate all proposed signs for the development;
    5. A completed zone change application on such forms as provided by the city, signed by the owner or owners in fee of the subject land and the owner of any option to purchase the property or any portion thereof, if any;
    6. Any additional information, plans, drawings, elevations, photos, diagrams and improvements as may be required by the planning director to adequately review the project.
B. When the PCD zone is used as a combining zone, the zone change application is not required to include development plans. Development plans as indicated in subsections (A)(1) through (A)(4) and (A)(6) shall be required prior to approval of a subdivision map pursuant to Section 16.28.170(O) or prior to issuance of a building permit as appropriate, and shall be considered at an advertised public hearing before the planning commission. A complete application and fee shall be required. The application and fee shall be the same as that for a site plan review hearing. The hearing shall constitute the review and approval of the preliminary development plans. Modifications to approved plans will be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 17.54.100.
C. When the PCD zone is used as a combining zone, approval of development plans by the planning commission is final. If appealed, development plans shall be presented to the city council for final action at a noticed public hearing in accordance with Section 17.64.050(B).

*Prior ordinance history: Ord. 3012.

17.57.010 Purpose.
Placement of metal storage containers on lots within the city for use as permanent storage facilities constitutes a use of such structures other than that for which they were designed and intended. Such placement, except for emergency purposes or in conjunction with construction projects, may negatively impact the aesthetics of neighborhoods in which they are placed, or discourage investment in permanent improvements in such neighborhoods. Metal storage containers may, however, reasonably be utilized to provide alternative permanent storage facilities if their potentially blighting influences and other potential adverse impacts are mitigated. The regulations set forth in this chapter are intended to accomplish such mitigation. (Ord. 3869 § 2, 1998)

17.57.020 Permitted.
A. Subject to approval of a plot plan and issuance of building permits, and subject to the regulations set forth in this chapter, metal storage containers, as accessory uses, are permitted in only the zones listed below as follows:
+------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------+
|       Zone       |    Parcel or Site Area    | Maximum Number of Containers |
+------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------+
| C-1, C-2, P.C.D. | less than 1/2 acre        | 1                            |
+------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------+
|                  | 1/2 acre or more          | 2                            |

+------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------+
|                  | 1/2 acre or more but less | 2                            |
|                  | than 1 acre               |                              |
+------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------+
|                  | 1 acre or more but less   | 3                            |
|                  | than 2 acres              |                              |

17.58.020 Facilities required.
A. For each new dwelling, new multiple-family dwelling, new business or new industrial establishment or other new or moved structures, or for any change of use of any existing structure, or for any addition to an existing use, there shall be provided and maintained off-street parking facilities to accommodate the motor vehicles required by the use of the property or structures as set forth in this chapter.
B. All parking for residential uses shall be on the same lot or parcel except where allowed pursuant to Section 17.58.070(B). Parking for all other uses shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the use served or be immediately adjacent to the subject property subject to the provisions of Section 17.58.070(A) and (C). (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.030 Minimum dimensions for required parking and freight loading spaces.
A. Parking Spaces. Each off-street parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet wide by eighteen feet deep and shall be designed according to standards established by the traffic engineer.
B. Freight Loading Spaces. Each off-street loading space shall have a minimum length of thirty-five feet, a minimum width of ten feet, and a minimum vertical clearance, including entry and exit, of fourteen feet, except the minimum length for the first such space required for any structure or use shall be twenty-five feet and the minimum vertical clearance, including entry and exit, shall be twelve feet. These dimensions shall be exclusive of platform, driveways, drive aisles, and maneuvering areas.

17.58.040 Rules for calculating required parking and freight loading areas.
A. In calculating off-street parking and freight loading spaces, the following rules shall apply:
    1. Parking computations will be based on the gross floor area of entire buildings and structures unless otherwise stated in this chapter. For buildings and structures being remodeled or to which additional floor area is being added, the parking computations shall also be based on the gross area of the entire building or structure.
    2. When after computing the number of parking spaces required for a structure there appears a fractional requirement of one-half or more of a parking space, one additional parking space shall be required. If after such computation the fractional requirement for a given number of spaces is below one-half space, no additional parking will be required for that fractional parking space.
    3. Parking for buildings containing three or more stories shall be based on the conditioned or net floor area.
B. The requirements for off-street parking and loading for any use not specifically mentioned shall be the same as for a use specified which is similar, as determined by the planning director.
C. Where a parcel or site contains a use with existing legal nonconforming parking, no additional parking shall be required unless there is a change of use, a new building or use is proposed, or an existing building or use is enlarged. Parking will then be assessed as follows:
    1. Building additions will only be required to provide new parking based on the added floor area.
    2. If a new use requires less parking than the previous use, no additional parking shall be required.
    3. Parking lots or garages with legal non-conforming design standards may remain subject to approval of the planning director and traffic engineer provided such does not compromise traffic circulation or public safety. (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.050 General standards as to location and arrangement of parking.
A. Every new off-street parking or loading space shall have adequate means of ingress from and egress to a street or alley that is designed and paved in accordance to adopted city standards.

B. The internal layout of off-street parking and loading spaces, driveways, aisles and maneuvering areas shall be clearly marked according to city standards.
C. Parking spaces for people with disabilities shall be provided and designed in accordance with Title 24 of the California Administrative Code and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. These parking stalls shall be allowed to be counted as part of the total number of parking spaces required for the use or building.
D. Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be arranged so as to prevent encroachments upon street rights-of-way, adjacent properties, and landscaping areas required pursuant to Chapter 17.61 of this code. In approving the design of said parking and loading facilities the approving authority shall consider the maneuvering, standing and storage of vehicles, and layout of the facilities, and may require the use of curbing, bumper or wheel guards, or other such devices as necessary to ensure compliance with this section.
E. Freight and merchandise loading docks or loading areas shall not be visible from any public street. Landscaped buffers and/or walls shall be used to screen these areas from public view.
F. For all multiple-family projects, driveways shall not exceed a width of thirty feet (top-to-top) or the minimum width necessary for two-way travel as determined by the traffic engineer.
G. Driveways crossing sidewalks shall be arranged, to the extent practical, to minimize the width and frequency of curb cuts, and conflicts with pedestrian and transit movements as determined by the traffic engineer.
H. Every off-street parking or loading facility and access thereto shall be suitably graded, paved, drained, and maintained according to standards adopted by the city engineer. Whenever corrosive materials are loaded or unloaded, docks, driveways, off-street loading and parking areas shall be concrete or equivalent as required by the city engineer.
I. New off-street parking facilities, or additions or alterations to existing off-street parking facilities shall be subject to approval pursuant to Chapter 17.08 of this code.
J. No area credited as all or part of a required off-street parking space shall also be credited as all or part of a required off-street loading space, or used for off-street loading. No area credited as all or part of a required loading space shall also be credited as all or part of a required off-street parking space, or used for off-street parking.
K. In no event shall any parking required and provided pursuant to Section 17.58.010 through 17.58.110 be situated in such way that vehicles entering the parking area be allowed to back onto any street or thoroughfare in order to leave said property, except as follows.
    1. This provision shall not apply to any single-family residence in an area zoned residential.
    2. On streets which have not been designated by the traffic authority as arterial or collector streets, the traffic authority is granted the power to permit backing onto such streets for multiple-family projects containing four units or less on a site that is not part of a multiple-family subdivision project where such backing will not adversely affect traffic, and the design, width and function of the driveway is similar to a single-family residential driveway use.
L. Neither the area of a required side yard abutting a street nor the required front yard shall be used for off-street parking or drive aisles required by this code except as allowed in Section 17.58.050(M). In the P zone, off-street parking shall be setback a minimum of ten feet along all street frontages.
M. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 17.58.110, the area of a required front yard or street side yard in an R-2, R-3 or R-4 zone may be encroached to the extent of four feet for off-street parking required by this chapter, subject to the following limitations and conditions:
    1. The encroaching parking space must be an extension of and parallel to a row of parking containing two or more spaces;
    2. The prohibition against backing onto streets contained in Section 17.58.050(K) shall apply;
    3. On corner lots or lots at intersecting streets, no such encroachment is permitted in a sixty-foot corner cutoff area as measured along the intersecting street curb-lines as extended;
    4. Any landscaping or walls required by subsection N of this section in the encroached area or the sixty-foot corner cutoff area must be approved by the city traffic engineer.
N. Where the parking area or lot, including driveways, drive aisles, delivery areas, and loading and unloading areas, is adjacent to property zoned residential, it shall be separated by a continuous solid wall of masonry construction a minimum height of six feet as measured from highest adjacent grade and by a continuous landscaped strip at least seven feet in width; however, this landscape strip shall not be required for projects containing four units or less in any R-2, R-3, or R-4 zone and not adjacent to any single-family residential zone except to satisfy minimum shading requirements in Section 17.61.030(H). Additionally, where common, shared, or joint use of parking or drive aisles exist or will occur between residentially and/or commercially zoned properties and such is recorded according to Section 17.58.080, the wall and landscape separation shall not be required. Any wall located within or along the front yard setback shall not exceed a height of four feet.
O. All delivery, loading and solid waste operations shall be subject to the provisions of Section 17.08.140(G).
P. Within the “central district” and properties zoned C-B and C-C, any off-street freight loading area located within fifty feet of any residential zoned or developed property shall be completely enclosed within a building if such freight loading is used between the hours of 10:00 pm and 7:00 am.

(Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.060 Parking lots.
A. All parking lots shall be paved, including driveways, drive aisles and loading areas, with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or any other paved street surfacing material approved by the city engineer. Unless otherwise approved by the city engineer, if asphaltic concrete is used, it shall be a minimum thickness of two inches over three inches of approved base material with adequate drainage provided; if concrete is used, it shall be a minimum thickness of four inches.
B. Lighting shall be installed in all parking lots and parking garages which accommodate passenger vehicles, with the exception of parking areas for residential projects with four units or less, in compliance with the following provisions:
    1. Illumination shall be generally distributed across the parking area and operational during business hours. Lighting shall be designed and arranged in such a manner so that light is directed downward and is reflected away from adjacent properties and streets. The building official may at any time require use of glare shields or baffles for glare reduction or control of backlight.
    2. Light poles, standards and fixtures, including bases or pedestals, shall not exceed a height of forty feet. Light sources less than fifty feet from the property line of any residentially zoned or designated lot or existing residential development shall not exceed a height of fifteen feet.
    3. Lighting sources, fixtures and related structures shall be maintained in sound operating condition at all times.

E. Any parking lot with more than ten spaces adjacent to a public street shall be screened via one of the following options: (1) landscaped berms, (2) retaining walls, (3) evergreen hedges or (4) a combination thereof, a minimum height of forty-eight inches at the time of installation, as measured from the adjacent parking lot top of pavement. Option 2 shall include the planting of shrubs between the wall and the sidewalk.
F. Shopping cart corrals, if provided, shall not be located within required parking stalls, drive aisles or loading areas. (Ord. 4943 § 1, 2018; Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.070 Required parking on the same lot as the structure or use served—Exceptions.
A. The nonresidential parking requirements of Sections 17.58.010 through 17.58.110 may be satisfied by owning adjacent parking facilities or leasing the required parking spaces from properties adjacent to the subject property. If parking is proposed on an adjacent parcel, said parking must be considered readily accessible to the subject property as determined by the planning director. If off-street parking is proposed on an adjacent parcel, said parking shall conform to the requirements in Section 17.58.070(C). of this code.
B. Off-site parking for uses within the “central district” and properties zoned C-B and C-C shall be subject to the following exceptions and requirements:
    1. Required off-street parking spaces for one-family or two-family dwellings in residential zones shall be located on the same lot as the dwellings served.
    2. Required off-street parking spaces for all other dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling served, as an accessory use, or within a walking distance of five hundred feet, as either a permitted or a conditional use, depending upon the use provisions applicable to the zone in which such parking is located, and such parking shall be easily recognized for that project, such as but not limited to, signs, dedicated and improved pedestrian ways, and other identification as approved by the planning director. Required off-street parking spaces for projects designed for senior citizens or the handicapped shall be on site.
    3. Required off-street parking spaces for all uses other than dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the use served, as an accessory use, or within a walking distance of one thousand feet, as either a permitted or a conditional use, depending upon the use provisions applicable to the zone in which such parking is located, and such parking shall be easily recognized for that project, such as but not limited to, signs, dedicated and improved pedestrian ways, and other identification as approved by the planning director.
    4. Walking distance for purposes of subsections (B)(2) and (B)(3) above shall mean the distance from the front or main customer door of the building to the nearest point of the off-street parking facility assigned to such structure or use or part thereof, along the shortest and most convenient improved pedestrian walkway open to the user or users of such off-street parking space.
    5. Whenever the planning director determines that sufficient spaces are available in a public parking facility within one thousand feet of a new business, he or she may accept a contract pursuant to Section 17.58.070(C) for such spaces in satisfaction of the off-street parking requirements of this chapter.
C. In order to be credited toward the parking requirements of any development, use, or structure, any off-street parking space located on a lot other than the lot on which the structure or use to be served is located must meet the following criterion:
    1. Assurances as to the availability of remote parking spaces must be provided. Such availability shall be assured either by ownership of both the lot containing the structure or use to be served and the lot containing the off-street parking space by at least one common owner, or by a lease or other instrument providing for the availability of the parking space for not less than the actual lifetime of the structure or until a change of use or modification to an existing use occurs. An attested copy of any such instrument shall be filed with the planning department prior to approval of any building permit application affected by this arrangement for provision of required off-street parking. In addition, in either case, a document in a form approved by the city attorney shall be executed by the parties concerned, and recorded in the office of the Kern county recorder, serving as a notice of the restrictions under this code applying both to the lot requiring and the lot containing the off-street parking space, by virtue of this arrangement for provision of required off-street parking. (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.080 Shared use of required parking.
A. Shared parking for projects of one acre or less that contains a mix of residential and retail/office commercial uses that maintain the existing scale, architectural charac-ter, and general neighborhood character of the area, will be assessed based on the highest single-use demand as determined by the planning director.
B. Shared use of the same off-street parking spaces to meet the requirements of two or more structures or uses may be permitted where the normal hours of operations of such structures or uses are such as to assure the feasibility of such shared use of parking, and where the total quantity of spaces provided is at least equal to the total of the projected parking demand for the structures or uses in operation at any given time. Use of a shared parking model from the Urban Land Institute, International Council of Shopping Centers, or other recognized shared parking model may be used to determine minimum parking requirements in lieu of the standard schedule of parking in Section 17.58.110 as approved by the planning director.
C. In order to be credited toward the parking requirements of this chapter, an off-street parking space made available for shared use and located on a lot other than the lot on which the structure or use to be served is located, must be available for the actual lifetime of the structure or use to be served. Such availability shall be assured in the manner provided for in Section 17.58.070 of this chapter. In addition, an attested copy of a contract among all the parties concerned setting forth their agreement to such shared use shall be filed with the planning department prior to approval by said department of any building permit application affected by the arrangement for joint use of parking. In any such case a notice of restrictions upon the affected properties shall be executed in a form approved by the city attorney and recorded in the office of the Kern county recorder, making specific reference to said contract and describing the arrangement for shared use of parking. (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.090 Reduction of parking where area requirements are satisfied.
In instances in which the city council has officially determined that the required off-street parking space requirements for uses in a defined area will be satisfied in whole or in part by public off-street parking facilities constructed or authorized to be constructed, off-street parking required for a use may be correspondingly reduced. (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.100 On-street parking credit.
Along local streets only and where on-street parking is permitted, on-street parking credit will be given along the street frontage of the project site as follows:
A. On-street parking credits will be allowed for all nonresidential uses.
B. For residential uses, only fifty percent of the guest parking that is required by this code will qualify for on-street parking credit.
C. On-street parking for disabled persons that is required by Section 15.58.050(C) shall not be credited unless the space is authorized by the building director in accordance with Title 24 of the aforementioned section, and is approved by the traffic engineer.
D. Parallel spaces will be credited at one space per twenty-two feet and angled spaces will be credited at one space per fourteen feet of uninterrupted curb along the parcel or site frontage minus driveways, fire hydrant breaks, and other space not permitted for parking by the traffic engineer.
E. On-street parking credits may be permitted along collector streets at the discretion of the traffic engineer. However, his or her approval will consider such issues that include, but are not limited to, traffic safety, circulation patterns, speed limits, traffic volume, future improvements, and other traffic planning considerations where on-street parking may need to be limited or prohibited.
F. If on-street parking along a street is restricted or prohibited in the future by the city, the use or building will not be required to make up the lost spaces on site and will be deemed legal nonconforming subject to the provisions of Section 17.58.040(C). (Ord. 4521 § 10, 2008)

17.58.110 Parking space requirements by land use.
A. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained for the following specified uses or facilities identified in the table in subsection E of this section. The number of off-street parking spaces shall not exceed one hundred fifty percent of the minimum requirement (limit does not apply to residential uses).
B. Tandem parking will not be counted toward the requirement for legal off-street parking, except one tandem parking space will be permitted for a single-family dwelling, and for each unit of a multiple-family dwelling that contains four units or less on a site that is not part of a multiple-family subdivision project.
C. Motorcycle parking that is provided and clearly identified for such use, may be counted as part of the total number of parking spaces required for a nonresidential use or building. However, this credit shall not exceed twenty-five spaces or five percent of the total parking required, whichever is less.
D. For uses not listed in the parking space requirements table, parking will be determined by the planning director based on the listed use(s) that most closely resembles the proposed use.

Chapter 17.59 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES NOT IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY

Sections:
17.59.010    Purpose.

17.59.030    Development and design standards.
17.59.040    Abandonment and removal.

17.59.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless telecommunication facilities not in the public right-of-way, including towers and antennas, in accordance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended. The goals of this chapter are to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas, encourage their location in industrial and commercial areas, encourage the joint use of new and existing facilities, encourage users to configure such facilities in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impacts, and consider the public health and safety in the siting and use of the facilities. In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to the general plan, zoning of existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of wireless telecommunication facilities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter as provided herein, Chapter 12.30 of this code shall apply to the placement, construction, or modification of wireless telecommunication facilities within the public right-of-way, as provided therein.

17.60.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the growth of the city in an orderly and attractive manner and to provide standards to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the type, number, area, height, quality of materials, construction, illumination, location and maintenance of all signs and sign structures. The use of signs is regulated by zone. Their placement and physical dimensions are regulated primarily by type and length of street frontage. This chapter is not intended to, nor shall any of its provisions be construed to modify or repeal the Uniform Sign Code, Chapter 15.36, except as specified.
The sign regulations of this chapter are intended to accomplish the following results:
A. Protect and enhance the character of residential neighborhoods and property values by prohibiting obtrusive and incompatible signs.
B. Promote and maintain healthy commercial centers and property values for effective identification and communication of the nature of goods and services and avoidance of wasteful and unsightly competition in signs.
C. Attract and direct persons to various activities and enterprises, in order to provide for public convenience.
D. Provide a reasonable system of sign control throughout the city.
E. Encourage signs which are well designed and pleasing in appearance and to provide incentive and latitude for variety, good design relationship and spacing.
F. Encourage a desirable urban character.
G. Enhance the economic value of the community and each area thereof through the reasonable regulation of such things as type, number, area, height, location and illumination of signs.
H. Encourage signs which are harmonious with adjacent land uses and to encourage architectural compatibility.
I. Reduce possible traffic and safety hazards through good signing.
J. Provide a reasonable amortization period for the removal of nonconforming signs.
K. Implement the objectives, policies and programs of the general plan. (Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.020 Permits.
A. Permit Required. No sign shall be painted, placed, pasted, posted, printed, tacked, fastened, constructed, erected, re-erected, installed, altered or otherwise permitted or maintained without first obtaining a permit from the building director in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and Chapter 15.36 of this code.
B. Permit Not Required. Regardless of subsection A of this section, permits from the building director are not required for the following signs:
    1. Real estate sales, rent, lease or open house; construction/home improvement, future facility use or tenant signs, and agricultural signs not exceeding sixteen square feet in area and six feet in height, placed on the property subject to such sign;
    2. Changing of the advertising copy or message on a theater marquee, readerboard, menuboard, or similar such sign;
    3. Repainting or cleaning of an outdoor advertising structure or changing the advertising copy or message thereon shall not be considered an erection or alteration which requires a sign permit unless a structural change is made;

C. Other Actions. Uses permitted under conditional use permits, wall and landscape plans, zone changes, specific plans, and other such projects may include signage as part of and in accordance with the permit or project. The board of zoning adjustment, planning commission, or city council may approve, deny, limit or grant modifications to such signage consistent with the provisions of this chapter. If a comprehensive sign plan is required as a condition of approval for such project, a separate application for said plan shall be required pursuant to Section 17.60.030.
D. Exceptions. The building director may, in writing, grant exceptions to the following sign regulations provided it has been determined that strict application of the provisions of this chapter places an unnecessary hardship in satisfying the purposes of this chapter:
    1. Reduction of the minimum sign setbacks or minimum distance between signs of not more than ten feet;
    2. Signage on properties having no street frontage; provided, that any such sign permitted shall not exceed the regulations as delineated by the zone district in which they are located;
    3. Additional on-site residential project identification signs, not to exceed two additional per project, or an increase in sign area of one residential identification project sign to sixty-four square feet;
    4. An increase of a monument sign located within a commercial or industrial zone district to sixty square feet in area and twelve feet in height, provided the total number of monument signs per street frontage shall not exceed two signs and no pylon sign exists along that street frontage or will be permitted.
E. Modification of Regulations Not Permitted. Signs shall only be permitted provided they meet the regulations of the zone district in which they are located for that type of sign. With the exception of subsection D of this section or Section 17.60.030 regarding comprehensive sign plans, no waivers of, exceptions to, or modification of any regulation of this chapter shall be permitted.
F. Fees. The city may impose fees to offset the costs associated with permit administration and monitoring pursuant to Chapter 3.70. (Ord. 4953 § 2, 2018; Ord. 4712 § 1, 2012; Ord. 3870 §§ 1, 2, 1998; Ord. 3755 § 4, 1997; Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.030 Comprehensive sign plans.
The comprehensive sign plan is a program that may allow developers or business owners of a shopping/business center or other such project, to request special consideration of signs that are specifically integrated into the overall architectural style or theme for that project. Because signage can play an important role in the overall site design in order to set it apart from other similar projects, a comprehensive sign plan can create an effect both desired and unique that will enhance the overall environment of the development. However, it is not the intent of this section to be used to request relief of the sign regulations in order to circumvent any requirements or purpose of this chapter.
A. General Requirements. Any person may file with the city a comprehensive sign plan application for only the following projects:
    1. Shopping/business center developments as defined in this title, including office and industrial complexes. The application for the plan shall be signed by more than fifty percent of the property owners, not including royalty interests, of the real property constituting the center.
    2. PCD (planned commercial development) projects.
    3. Areas covered by a specific plan where signage was not identified in said plan.
    4. Public and semi-public institutional projects.
    5. Neighborhood/subdivision identification sign program. This program is limited to developments of one hundred acres or more that have frontage along an arterial and/or collector street of one-half mile or more.
B. Condition of Project Approval. Comprehensive sign plans may be required by the city council, planning commission, or board of zoning adjustment as part of any project approval as specified in Section 17.60.020(C).
C. Application Information. Any comprehensive sign plan application shall be submitted to the planning department on a form provided by that department. Information submitted shall include, but is not limited to, location, size, height, color, lighting, number, visual effects, and orientation of all proposed and existing signs as they pertain to the comprehensive sign plan.
D. Authority and Review. The planning commission shall have the authority under the conditions provided in this chapter to permit the utilization of comprehensive sign plans and may approve signs that are more or less restrictive than the sign regulations set forth in this chapter.
    1. All comprehensive sign plan requests shall be heard by the planning commission at a public hearing. The applicant, their authorized agent, property owners and operators of the businesses affected shall be notified by mail of the time and place of the hearing before the planning commission at least ten days before hearing.
    2. Exceptions to the sign regulations in this chapter may be permitted, provided the planning commission finds that the comprehensive sign plan as a whole is in conformity with the purpose of this chapter and such exceptions are for the general welfare resulting in an improved relationship among the various signs, building facades, or overall project covered by the plan.
    3. The planning commission may require special conditions on approved plans such as, but not limited to, bonds or other type of security to ensure the removal or abatement of signs that are abandoned or are in violation of any condition of an approved plan, or a time schedule for any sign program where signage is not considered permanent.
    4. The planning commission shall either approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the comprehensive sign plan at the public hearing. All decisions by the planning commission are final and conclusive.
    5. An approved comprehensive sign plan may be changed or modified subject to the same process as a new application.
    6. Where an application for a comprehensive sign plan has been denied by the planning commission, no reapplication or new application for the same or nearly the same such plan on the property shall be considered for a period of one year from the date of the decision. However, where a change has occurred which, in the discretion of the planning commission, indicates that the new application is significantly different and that reconsideration would serve the public interest, this time period may be waived provided the planning commission makes such a finding.
    7. The planning director may grant minor changes to an approved comprehensive sign plan provided any such change does not alter the overall architectural design or style of signs approved by such plan, and there is no increase in the total area of signs.
E. Future Signs. A comprehensive sign plan may be approved where signs for satellite pads or other such detached future buildings have not been identified and considered under such approved plan. In these instances, unless otherwise conditioned, such future signs shall be subject to the requirements of the C-1 zone district.
F. Existing Signs as Part of a Comprehensive Sign Plan. If any new or amended comprehensive sign plan is filed for property on which existing signs are located, those signs shall be integrated into the plan and shall be in compliance with that plan prior to issuance of a permit for any new sign permitted under said plan.
G. Permits Prohibited Until Decision Rendered. No permit shall be issued for any sign on property where a comprehensive sign plan has been applied for and is pending a decision from the planning commission.
H. Withdrawal of Plan. An approved comprehensive sign plan may be withdrawn by the applicant provided: (1) it is not required as a condition of project approval; (2) no signs have been installed pursuant to such plan; (3) all signs installed since approval of said plan comply with the requirements of the zone district in which they are located; or (4) all signs in the center or project comply with the provisions of the zone district in which they are located. The withdrawal shall be submitted in writing to the planning department.
I. Binding Effect. After approval of a comprehensive sign plan, no signs shall be erected, placed, painted, installed, or otherwise permitted, except in conformance with said plan. The plan shall be enforced in the same manner as any other provision in this chapter. The comprehensive sign plan shall be attached to the lease agreements or sale of space within the project and becomes binding for the entire site for both existing and future owners/tenants. In case of any conflict between the provisions of the plan and this chapter, the approved plan shall control. (Ord. 4729 § 2, 2013; Ord. 4489 § 2, 2008; Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.040 Sign area computations.
The following criteria shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
A. Area of Individual Signs (Single Face). The area of a sign face, which is also the area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face, shall be computed by means of the smallest measurable polygon that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, logo, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display, or used to differentiate the sign from the background or structure against which it is placed. If a sign is composed of individual letters or symbols with no added decoration, the total sign area shall be calculated by measuring the area of each individual letter and/or symbol; the combined areas shall be the total sign area.
B. Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of a single sign face pursuant to subsection A of this section. When sign faces are placed back to back or in a way that only one face can be viewed from any point, and when such sign faces are part of the same structure and are not more than two feet apart, the total sign area shall be computed by measuring one of the faces if they are all of equal area or the largest face if they are of unequal area.
C. Structural Support Area. The area of a sign does not include any supporting framework, bracing or other support, whether or not it has been architecturally treated, provided said support does not exceed twenty-five percent of the allowable sign area for a pylon sign, and fifty percent of the allowable sign area for a monument sign. If the support area exceeds these percentages, any excess shall be computed as part of the total sign area.
D. Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign including any of its structural support, at grade as defined in this title, to the top of the highest component of the sign. (Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.050 Sign location restrictions.
A. Signs shall not be placed on any curb, sidewalk, post, pole, light standard, hydrant, bridge, tree or other surface located on public property, and shall not be located within, over or across any public right-of-way or public parkway including street median islands, except as may otherwise be authorized by this chapter. These restrictions do not apply to signs by a public agency that identify public facilities; such signs shall be subject to the zone district in which the facility is located. Any such sign hereby prohibited constitutes a nuisance, and shall not become a legal nonconforming sign.
B. Signs shall not be permitted near the intersection of any street, pedestrian crosswalks, alley or any vehicle access in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision of motor vehicle operators, or at any location where by reason of its position, shape, illumination or color, it may interfere with or be confused with any authorized sign, signal or device, or which makes use of a work, symbol, phrase illumination, shape or color in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic. Any such sign constitutes a nuisance and shall not become a legal nonconforming sign.
C. Permanent freestanding signs, except monument and directional signs, shall be prohibited in the following areas:
    1. The Truxtun Avenue corridor between the west right-of way line of State Highway 99 and the east right-of-way line of Coffee Road, a width of five hundred feet from the right-of-way of Truxtun Avenue or between the north right-of-way line of the Cross Valley Canal and the south right-of-way line of the Carrier Canal/Santa Fe Railroad, whichever distance is greater;
    2. Along or within one thousand feet of the right-of-way of State Highway 178 east of Oswell Street, commencing at a point five hundred feet east of the centerline of Oswell Street;
    3. Along or within one thousand feet of the right-of-way of Alfred Harrell Highway;
    4. Along or within one thousand feet of the right-of-way of Stockdale Highway west of the Arvin-Edison canal;
    5. Along or within one thousand feet of the right-of-way of Panorama Drive;
    6. Along or within one thousand feet of the right-of-way of the Westside Parkway from State Highway 99 to its western terminus.
A map delineating these corridors prohibiting freestanding signs is shown at the end of this chapter. (Ord. 4729 § 3, 2013; Ord. 4489 § 3, 2008; Ord. 3870 § 3, 1998; Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.060 Sign development standards.
A. General Regulations. The following provisions shall apply to all signs unless otherwise stated in this chapter:
    1. Signs or their supporting members shall not be erected, altered, relocated, or maintained so as to interfere with or restrict access to a window or other opening in a building in such manner as to limit air circulation or obstruct or interfere with the free use of a fire escape, exit, standpipe, stairway, door, ventilator or window, or similar opening. Any such sign constitutes a nuisance and shall not become a legal nonconforming sign.
    2. All signs shall be constructed, installed and maintained to structurally comply with all applicable requirements of the Building Code and Uniform Sign Code, as adopted and amended by the city. Those signs incorporating electrical components shall be constructed and maintained to also comply with the Electrical Code as adopted by the city.
    3. Where signs are permitted to be illuminated, the following regulations shall apply:
        a. Floodlighting is permitted only when such lighting is installed on private property or property maintained by a maintenance district, and is hooded or shielded so that the light source is not a nuisance or detrimental to persons viewing such area, nor affect or interfere with vehicular traffic, pedestrians, or adjacent properties in any manner.
        b. Outlining of a building by means of exposed neon tubing is permitted only where the amperage does not exceed thirty milliamperes. Outlining of a building by means of exposed incandescent lighting is permitted if the wattage does not exceed forty watts per bulb and the units of lights forming the line marking the outer limits or edges of a building, or window or roof of a building, are at least two feet apart.
        c. Exposed bulbs forming a part of a sign are permitted, provided they do not exceed fifteen watts per bulb; signs in the C-2, C-C, C-B, M-1, M-2 and M-3 zone districts may be allowed up to forty watts per bulb. Neon signs shall not exceed thirty milliamperes. Bulbs providing indirect lighting not visible from off the premises of the sign are not subject to this subsection. Exposed reflector-type lamps forming part of a sign or used to illuminate a sign are prohibited in all instances.
        d. Flashing signs are only permitted in the C-2, C-C, C-B, M-1, M-2 and M-3 zone districts and shall not exceed a total of sixty milliamperes for neon signs, and ten watts for incandescent signs.
        e. Signs that contain changeable copy produced by light emitting diodes (LEDs), incandescent or low voltage lamps or bulbs, cathode ray tubes (CRTs), plasma, or other such lighting devices, shall include automatic brightness compensation features to adjust brightness to compensate for sun angle and ambient light conditions, and ensure that the sign is visible but not excessively bright to adversely affect motorists or nearby residents.

17.60.070 Specialized signs.
A. Off-Site Residential Subdivision/Project Directional Kiosk Sign Program. The following is intended to provide for the administration of a uniform, coordinated sign program of kiosks that offer developers of new residential subdivisions means of providing direction to their projects. The kiosk signs will minimize confusion among prospective purchasers of new homes to find those developments, promote traffic safety by removing competing signs from busy streets, and reduce visual blight of incompatible sign types in residential neighborhoods. No such off-site directional sign other than those in conformance with this chapter shall be erected or maintained within the city.
    1. Requirements for Directional Kiosks. 
        a. Kiosks shall be permitted in all zone districts except on a lot developed with a single-family residence. They may be permitted on private land or public right-of-way that is maintained by the property owner provided the property owner’s permission has been granted in writing. Signs may also be permitted within the public right-of-way or parkway that is maintained by the city of Bakersfield or as contracted by the city subject to approval and issuance of an encroachment permit by the city. All other location restrictions in Section 17.60.050 shall remain in full force and effect.
        b. Kiosks shall be constructed of wood or similar product with individual panels provided for placement of subdivision or project names and direction.
        c. Kiosk locations shall be approved by the building director or appointed designee. A kiosk shall not be placed closer than one thousand feet from an existing kiosk or approved site where a kiosk is to be constructed. The building director or appointed designee may reduce the distance between kiosks where:
            i. Kiosks are located at different corners of an intersection and face different directions.
            ii. The street intersection where the kiosk is proposed is less than one thousand feet away from a street intersection that contains a kiosk and it is necessary to provide direction to subdivisions or projects to which that street provides the most direct or only access.
            iii. Kiosks (two maximum) are necessary to be placed adjacent to one another because the number of subdivisions or projects that are being identified exceeds the number of panels allowed on one kiosk.
        d. Architectural design, color, letter style, and any other design elements of the kiosk shall be approved by the planning commission and city council. All kiosks and other off-site residential directional signs allowed by Section 17.60.060(B)(1)(d)(ii) that are installed within the city limits shall be in accordance with adopted design criteria.
        e. Kiosks shall not exceed a height of twelve feet and a width of six feet. When a kiosk is sited immediately adjacent to a residential development, it shall not exceed a height of eight feet. An individual panel shall be limited to a maximum width of six feet and a height of ten inches. No more than eight individual name panels shall be permitted on a kiosk.
        f. Kiosks may have more than one face. Multiple faces are encouraged where the kiosk can be sited to serve traffic traveling in opposite directions, or where it would reduce the amount of kiosks needed to provide adequate direction to residential subdivisions. Multiple faced kiosks shall be approved by the building director or appointed designee.
        g. A name panel shall be limited to a single line of text that may contain only the subdivision, project, builder or developer’s name, or combination thereof. All panels shall include a direction arrow pointing in the direction of the identified project. Name panels shall conform to all design elements as approved in accordance with subsection (A)(1)(d) of this section.
        h. Tag signs, streamers, banners, balloons, devices, display boards, or other appurtenances shall not be added, placed upon or erected adjacent to or within a one hundred foot radius of any existing kiosk.
        i. Kiosks shall not be illuminated.
        j. Kiosks shall not obstruct the use of sidewalks, walkways, bicycle or hiking trails, and shall not obstruct the free and clear vision of motor vehicle operators, cyclists, pedestrians, or visibility of traffic control signs and lights as determined by the public works director or appointed designee.
        k. Kiosks shall be set back a minimum of twenty-five feet from side and rear property lines. No setback shall be required from street frontages or those kiosks located within public rights-of-way.
    2. Permits. 
        a. Any builder or developer of a new recorded residential subdivision which contains approved lots or homes which have never been sold, may apply for a permit to install a kiosk or to place a name panel on an existing kiosk to provide direction to their subdivision.
        b. Applications for a kiosk or name panel (including name changes to an existing name panel) shall be made on forms provided by the building director or appointed designee, be signed under penalty of perjury by the applicant, and shall require at minimum, the following information:
            i. The name, mailing address, title, telephone number of the property owner, subdivider and developer/builder of the specific development;
            ii. The name and location of the specific development;
            iii. A plot plan showing the exact location of the proposed kiosk, or the existing kiosk(s) where the panel(s) will be attached;
            iv. A statement that the development contains approved lots or new homes which have not yet been sold;
            v. If the permit is for a new name panel or a name change to an existing name panel, the copy proposed for the panel;
            vi. If the permit is for a new kiosk that is proposed to be located within a public road right-of-way, a copy of the approved encroachment permit issued by the city of Bakersfield public works department.
        c. The building director or appointed designee may issue a permit if:
            i. The application is complete and truthful;
            ii. The applicant is the permit or entity selling new lots or new homes;
            iii. The development is located entirely within the Metropolitan Bakersfield 2010 General Plan area;
            iv. The kiosk or panel meets all of the design criteria within this section;
            v. The permit is for a name panel and available space exists on the kiosk(s); or if there is no space available, the applicant has agreed to be placed on a waiting list for future placement on a kiosk(s);
            vi. If the permit is for a kiosk, the location criteria in this section has been satisfied;
            vii. Appropriate fees have been paid.
    3. Program Administration. 
        a. The city may delegate portions of or the entire administration of the directional kiosk program to another entity by contract that includes, but is not limited to, installation and maintenance of kiosks, and issuance of permits for kiosks and name panels.
        b. Kiosks and sign panels permitted in accordance with this section shall be continuously maintained in good condition by the permit holder. Upon approval by the city, sign maintenance may be assumed by a responsible party other than the permit holder.
        c. Kiosks shall be sited based on demand and where they will provide the best direction to residential subdivisions where homes/lots are being sold.
        d. Sign panels shall be available to all developments selling new homes on a first-come first-served basis. Sign panels shall be placed on a kiosk beginning with the highest position on the kiosk and progressing downward. Panels shall be grouped based on the direction of travel with the priority of placement from top to bottom as follows:
            i. Left turn;
            ii. Right turn;
            iii. Straight ahead.
        e. Waiting lists shall be established for each kiosk (existing or proposed) for new name panels on a first-come-first-served basis of applications that have met the requirements of subsection (A)(2)(c) of this section.
        f. When a panel name is changed or a panel is removed from a kiosk, all lower panels within each directional group as defined in subsection (A)(3)(d) of this section shall be moved upwards so that any new panel is placed on the bottom of its respective directional group on the kiosk.
        g. All panel changes shall be approved by the building director or appointed designee through the permit process.
        h. A specific project or builder is limited to one panel for each kiosk. Multiple panels shall not be combined to identify or provide information regarding the same specific project or builder. There shall be no limit on the number of kiosks on which a specific project may be identified.
        i. Within ten days after selling the last lot or home or within two years after recordation of the final map for the subdivision of which the project is located, whichever occurs first, panel signs that identify said project shall be removed from all kiosks. Two extensions of time may be granted by the administrator of the kiosk program not to exceed one year for each request if the extension is needed to complete any sales in that project. If administration of the program is delegated to an entity other than the city and that entity denies the extension, the permit holder may appeal the denial within five days of the decision in writing to the building director. The building director shall render a decision on the appeal within ten days of receiving the appeal which shall be final and conclusive.
        j. Any kiosk shall be completely removed by the permittee whenever any of the following occur:
            i. The kiosk is no longer needed at the location;
            ii. The permittee has been notified by the city of Bakersfield public works department to remove or relocate the kiosk on the basis of public safety or necessity, or because of planned road improvements.
        k. For any kiosk erected within the public road right-of-way, a performance bond in an amount sufficient to remove the structure shall be approved by and posted with the city of Bakersfield public works department.
    4. Violations and Abatement. 
        a. Off-site residential subdivision/project directional signs that were legally permitted as of June 1, 1997, shall continue to remain for a period of six months from said date. After that time, signs not in conformance with this section shall be removed by the owner at the owner’s cost. Any signs not removed within the required period shall be subject to summary abatement by the city in accordance with Section 17.60.110. This subsection shall not apply to existing kiosk programs that were legally established and maintained by a private entity where that program contains five or more kiosks.
        b. Existing kiosk sign programs that were legally established as of June 1, 1997, that are owned and maintained by a private entity where that program contains five or more kiosks, may continue as a nonconforming kiosk program. These kiosks may be maintained but shall not be replaced except with a kiosk that conforms to this section. A nonconforming kiosk shall be removed if it is no longer necessary at the location, or no longer meets the separation requirements of subsection (A)(1)(c) of this section regarding kiosk separation due to placement of a conforming kiosk. A nonconforming kiosk that is required to be removed shall be done by the owner at the owner’s cost. Any nonconforming kiosk not removed as required, shall be subject to summary abatement by the city in accordance with Section 17.60.110.
        c. Any permit issued in accordance with this section shall be immediately revoked by the building director if it has been found that the permit holder has erected and maintained any sign in violation of this section. The building director shall order any panel currently in place on a kiosk identifying the builder’s/developer’s specific development to be removed immediately after the appeal period has expired if no appeal has been filed, and that builder/developer shall be prohibited from having any off-site directional signs or name panels on any kiosk for that specific development for a period of one hundred eighty days. After the one-hundred-eighty-day period, the builder/developer may be allowed kiosk panels but they shall be placed at the bottom of any waiting list and/or kiosk hierarchy as described in subsection (A)(3)(d) through (f) of this section.
        d. Any order of the building director shall be made in writing, addressed to the permit holder, and shall set forth the findings for revoking any permits and the method to appeal the decision. If no appeal is filed, the decision of the building director shall be final and conclusive.
        e. If the city is not the administrator of the kiosk program, the administrator shall immediately notify the building director regarding any violations in accordance with subsection (A)(4)(c) of this section and the building director shall notify the party in violation in accordance with subsection (A)(4)(d) of this section.
    5. Appeal. 
        a. Should any permit holder be dissatisfied with the decision of the building director to revoke a permit, then the permit holder may, no later than ten days after notice of such decision was deposited in the United States mail, make written objection, subject to the required appeal fee, to the board of building appeals in care of the building director, setting forth the grounds for dissatisfaction. The board of building appeals shall hear the objections at a regular meeting no later than thirty days following the filing of the objection. The permit holder shall be given written notice of the hearing no later than three days prior to the hearing. The building board of appeals may sustain, suspend, or overrule the decision of the building director, which decision shall be final and conclusive.
        b. Pending hearing before the building board of appeals, all signs, kiosks and/or name panels in dispute may remain in place until a final decision rendered.
B. Special Event Signs. Special event signs may be approved by the building director as a means of publicizing events such as grand openings, carnivals, parades, charitable events, community holiday activities, and other such events.

    6. Signs may only be displayed for ninety days and must be removed for at least thirty days before being displayed again.
    7. Signs shall not block line of sight for intersections, driveways/entrances, sidewalks and multi-use paths.

17.60.100 Nonconforming signs.
A. Signs for a legal nonconforming use are permitted. Such signs shall be deemed to comply with the provisions of this chapter if they comply with the sign regulations for the most restrictive zoning district which permits the nonconforming use as a permitted use. Such sign shall be permitted only as long as the nonconforming use is permitted. Any such sign legally existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which does not comply with the regulations of this chapter shall be deemed to be a nonconforming sign.
B. For the purposes of this chapter, a nonconforming sign is one which does not conform with the provisions of this chapter, but which:
    1. Was lawfully in existence and in use within the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance first enacting this chapter;
    2. Was lawfully in existence and in use on property outside of the city on the date upon which the annexation of such property to the city was completed;
    3. Was lawfully in existence and in use within the city on the effective date of any zone change or specific plan or comprehensive sign plan for the property on which the sign is located; or
    4. Was lawfully in existence and in use within the city on the effective date of any amendment of this chapter, the zoning regulations contained in this title or other provision of this code, making such sign nonconforming.
C. For the purposes of this section only, a nonconforming sign exceeding the height or area restrictions contained in this chapter by no more than five percent shall be deemed to conform with the provisions of this chapter limiting height and area.
D. A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced, altered, reconstructed, relocated or expanded in any manner unless and until the sign is made to conform with the provisions of this chapter. This shall not be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance and minor repairs, as determined by the building director.
E. A nonconforming sign destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding fifty percent of its replacement cost immediately prior to destruction or damage, shall not be continued in use or maintained thereafter and shall be removed or made to conform with the provisions of this chapter within thirty days of the date of such destruction or damage.
F. Each nonconforming sign, other than an outdoor advertising sign subject to the California Outdoor Advertising Act, shall be removed or made to conform with the provisions of this chapter at the sole cost of the owner thereof, whenever any of the following events occur:
    1. There is a change in ownership of the property; inheritance by a member of a deceased owner’s family shall not be deemed to constitute a change of ownership;
    2. The business or activity is discontinued or sold;
    3. The property is rezoned, subdivided or parceled or the real property upon which the sign is located is severed from the real property upon which the business or primary use of the entire parcel is located, by lease, lease-back, or any other arrangement, method, device or scheme which would otherwise circumvent the intent of this section;
    4. A conditional use permit or modification is granted for the property or use of the property;
    5. A sign permit is issued permitting installation or construction of a new or additional sign on the property;
    6. Any change in the signage is made, excluding minor repairs and precise repainting;
    7. Whenever there is a change in ownership or tenancy of any business or tenant space within a business/shopping center, new wall signage and/or a monument sign conforming to the requirements of this chapter to signify such change is permitted although nonconforming signage exists within such center. However, no change of sign copy to signify such change shall be permitted on any nonconforming sign.
    8. If an existing off-premise business identification sign was permitted under a special sign permit by the city and has remained in effect and in compliance with the provisions of that permit, the sign may remain and can be upgraded or altered to reflect a change of business or ownership names even though on-premise signs are being changed or added. However, this sign shall be subject to the following before any new permits are issued:
        a. The sign shall continue to only identify the business or services offered, and shall include direction to the property for which the sign was originally permitted by the special sign permit.
        b. The area of the sign shall not exceed ninety-six square feet. If the sign is larger, it shall be reduced to not exceed this area. If the sign is smaller, it shall not exceed its present size. If a sign is reduced in area, under no circumstances shall it be enlarged even if previous approvals granted a larger size.
        c. The sign shall not be moved or reoriented, except under direction of the building director, to improve traffic visibility or safety, to relocate it outside the public right-of-way, or to increase separation from other legal freestanding signs.
G. Each such sign determined by the building director to be of historical significance, in accordance with criteria established by the city’s historical preservation commission, shall be exempt from the removal and conformance requirements of this chapter.
H. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authority for the city to remove without just compensation those signs which, under the California Outdoor Advertising Act, are subject m removal with compensation to the owner. (Ord. 3942 § 1, 1999; Ord. 3586 § 2, 1994)

17.60.110 Violation and abandonment.
A. Any sign that has been abandoned or installed illegally is hereby declared to be a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Bakersfield. Any sign which is partially or wholly obstructed by the growth of dry vegetation or weeds, or by the presence of debris or litter, also presents a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Bakersfield.
B. It shall be the duty of the owner and occupant to make immediate repair to any sign deemed by the building director to be imminently dangerous or perilous to the public safety. A sign maintained in violation of this section constitutes a public nuisance.

Said property owner or person in lawful possession shall first be served with a ten day notice to abate the nuisance by removing the sign and shall be given the opportunity to explain to the building director why such sign has not been removed. If, after such opportunity to explain, the building director orders the removal of the sign, the agents of the city shall have authority to enter upon the private property to remove the sign constituting the nuisance. The provisions of this subsection may be utilized separately from, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, any other remedy provided in this chapter or otherwise provided by law.
D. In the event any person erects, installs, alters, relocates or maintains any sign after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, which sign is in violation of any provision of this chapter, and the same is not removed after notice as specified in subsection C of this section, the same is a public nuisance and shall be subject to abatement at the expense of the person creating, causing, committing or maintaining it, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 38773-38773.7 of the Government Code.
E. The building director may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, whenever the permit is issued in error on the basis of incorrect information supplied by the applicant which results in there being a violation of any ordinance, regulations, or any provisions of this chapter.
F. With exception to those signs deemed nonconforming and subject to Section 17.60.100, the owner or person in lawful possession of any sign which is not operational or not used for a period of ninety days, or which was used to advertise or identify that which has been moved or discontinued for a period of ninety days, shall cover or remove all display copy from such sign immediately upon the expiration of such period. If said display copy is removed, any bulbs or other mechanical equipment that becomes exposed shall be covered or removed. If said display copy is not covered or removed within thirty days after notice by the building director, the city may cause said display copy to be removed or covered and the cost shall become a lien against the property on which the sign is located. Extensions for thirty day periods may be granted by the building director. The provisions of this subsection may be utilized separately from, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, any other remedy provided in this chapter or otherwise provided by law.
G. All signs, except nonconforming signs pursuant to Section 17.60.100, which do not conform with the provisions of this chapter, are public nuisances and shall be removed at the owner’s sole expense within sixty days after the effective date of this chapter. If said sign is not removed within said period, the city may cause said sign to be removed and the cost shall become a lien on the property on which the sign is located. Extensions for thirty day periods may be granted by the building director. The provisions of this subsection may be utilized separately from, as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, any other remedy provided in this code or otherwise provided by law.

17.61.010 Generally.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the necessary criteria, standards and limits for landscaping. The provisions of this section are intended to provide a transition between and mitigate conflicts which may arise between adjacent land uses, to promote an attractive visual harmony between the landscape and development, reduce air, noise and visual pollution, produce a healthy, vibrant, sustainable urban forest, decrease temperatures, increase comfort, and promote commerce and socialization, while promoting water use efficiency. Landscaping shall conform to the Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance (MWELO) as adopted in California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 2.7 as adopted by the state. (Ord. 4943 § 1, 2018; Ord. 4624 § 2, 2010; Ord. 4010 § 1, 2001)

17.61.020 Landscaping required.
A. All projects for which site plan approval is required shall install and maintain landscaping in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, these landscape requirements shall not apply to projects where a current use is expanded and the valuation of the building permit is less than fifty percent of the replacement value of the existing improvements. If the existing uses are to be expanded greater than fifty percent of their replacement value, the planning director shall determine the amount and placement of landscaping needed to comply with this section.
B. Occupancy of a use subject to these standards shall not be permitted until the approved landscaping and irrigation has been installed, or if permitted by the planning director, an agreement and/or surety bond or cash deposit sufficient to cover the cost of installation, which amount has been determined to complete the work plus administration costs by the city, and such has been provided to the city specifying completion of installation within a time specified by the planning director. (Ord. 4943 § 1, 2018; Ord. 4624 § 2, 2010; Ord. 4010 § 1, 2001)

17.61.030 Minimum landscape standards.
A. Installation of landscape materials and irrigation equipment shall be in accordance with commonly accepted methods of installation as approved by the city.
B. Trees shall be a minimum twenty-four-inch box container size or larger and shall be vigorous and healthy when planted. The minimum diameter of the tree trunk, as measured at a point four feet up the trunk from ground level, shall be one inch for a fifteen-gallon container tree, two inches for a twenty-four-inch box container tree, and three inches for a thirty-six-inch box container tree. These trunk diameters shall apply throughout this chapter where tree container sizes are specified.
C. Shrubs shall be a minimum five-gallon container size or larger and shall be vigorous and healthy when planted. Mass shrub planting for area coverage shall be a mix of five-gallon (forty percent) and one-gallon (sixty percent) container size with an average spacing of eighteen inches on center. Flats shall be used for ground covers with an average spacing of eight inches on center.
D. Shrubs and/or ground cover, including turf, shall cover no less than seventy-five percent of the required landscaped area within four years of planting.
E. A landscaped area fifteen feet in width on arterial and collector streets and eight feet in width on local streets as measured from the right-of-way line, shall be installed along said street. The width of the landscape strip may be reduced when, in the opinion of the planning director, the following conditions are met:
    1. The total square footage of required landscaped area remains constant.
    2. The reduction in the required width is consistent with the purposes of the landscape regulations of this chapter.
    3. In the central district (C-B and C-C zone districts) this reduction may include the planting of street trees only to allow adequate pedestrian access consistent with adjacent development.
F. Along street frontages, a tree shall be planted at a ratio of one tree per twenty lineal feet, or portion thereof. Trees may be clustered or grouped to not conflict with required fire lanes, public entrances/exits, utility easements, and signs provided the minimum tree to frontage ratio is satisfied. A species mix of thirty percent evergreen and seventy percent deciduous shall be maintained.
G. Trees shall be required to be planted within parking lots at a minimum ratio of one tree for each six parking spaces, but shall be sufficient to achieve the minimum shading required in subsection H of this section. The maximum spacing between trees shall not exceed sixty-five feet.
H. Trees shall be installed and thereafter maintained throughout the parking area to ensure that it will be shaded based on calculating the canopy area of each tree at fifteen years from a master tree list approved by the planning director. The landscape plan required by Section 17.08.080 shall be drawn to show that the tree canopy will have the potential to attain shading over forty percent of the total area of all uncovered parking stalls, loading areas, drive aisles and maneuvering areas. The property owner or the preparer of the plans shall show all shading calculations on the plan. Truck loading docks in front of overhead doors, truck maneuvering and parking areas unconnected to and exclusive of any required vehicle parking areas, freight yards, and surfaced areas for automobile sales, lumber yards, and vehicle storage are not subject to this shading requirement.
I. Buildings with main entrances facing parking lots shall be landscaped with a minimum of one tree for each fifty feet of linear building frontage or portion thereof. Said trees shall be adjacent to the building and may also be credited for parking lot trees if they comply with the requirements set forth in subsections G and H of this section. Trees may be clustered or grouped to not conflict with required fire lanes, public entrances/exits, and signs provided the minimum tree to building ratio is satisfied. The use of vines and large shrubs is encouraged to enhance the tree planting areas next to the building.
J. Of the total number of trees required in the parking area and for the entire project, a minimum of thirty percent shall be evergreen species.
K. In addition to the trees referenced in subsections G, H and I of this section, trees shall be installed along the property line perimeter, in the required landscape area required by Section 17.58.050(N), of drive aisles, parking lots, loading areas and storage areas as a buffer between office, commercial and industrial uses and property zoned for residential uses. Said trees shall be one hundred percent evergreen species spaced no further apart than twenty feet on center. The minimum tree size shall be a twenty-four-inch box container size if the adjacent residential zoned area is all or partially developed and a fifteen-gallon container size if the adjacent residential zoned area is undeveloped.
L. Landscaping and irrigation shall be installed in compliance with any approved site plan or other project approval prior to final inspection or occupancy.
M. Tree planters within the parking lot shall be a minimum of five feet by five feet (outside dimension). Vehicles may overhang into these planters no more than two and one-half feet provided the tree is protected from damage by a vehicle.
N. If a drive-thru lane is located adjacent to a public street it shall be screened via one of the following options: (1) an evergreen hedge installed at a minimum initial height of four feet; or (2) a wall or berm installed at a minimum height of four feet.

17.62.010 Purpose and intent.
A. The city recognizes that the extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic well-being of the city and to the needs of society, and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect health and safety. The city also recognizes that the reclamation of mined lands will provide for the protection and subsequent beneficial use of the land. Since surface mining operations may take place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological, and social conditions are significantly different, reclamation operations may also vary accordingly.
B. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to safeguard the continued availability of important mineral resources while regulating surface mining operations as required by the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA). These regulations will assure that:
    1. Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized, and that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses.
    2. The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged while giving consideration to value relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment.
    3. Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.010)

17.62.020 Incorporation by reference of state regulations.
The provisions of SMARA (Public Resources Code Section 2710 et seq.), Public Resources Code Section 2207 (relating to annual reporting requirements), and the California Code of Regulations (Title 14, Division 2, Section 8, Subchapter 1, Section 3500 et seq.), as those provisions and regulations may be amended from time to time, are made a part of this chapter by reference with the same force and effect as if they were specifically contained in this chapter. Whenever the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive than correlative state provisions, this chapter shall prevail. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.020)

17.62.030 Applicability.
A. Except as provided in this chapter, no person shall conduct a surface mining operation unless a conditional use permit, reclamation plan and financial assurance for reclamation have first been approved by the city. Any applicable exemption from this requirement or other provisions of this chapter does not automatically exempt a project or activity from adhering to other regulations, ordinances or policies of the city or state, including but not limited to, the application of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), other permits, the payment of development impact fees, or the imposition of other dedications and exactions as may be permitted under the law. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the city, public and private.
B. This chapter shall not apply to any of the following activities:
    1. Excavations or grading conducted for farming, or for the purpose of restoring land following a flood or natural disaster;
    2. On-site excavation and on-site earthmoving activities which are an integral and necessary part of a development that is undertaken to prepare a site for construction of structures, streets, landscaping or other land improvements, including related excavation, grading, compaction or the creation of fills, road cuts and embankments, whether or not surplus materials are exported from the site. These development related improvements must have been approved by the city in accordance with applicable provisions of state law, locally adopted plans and ordinances, and CEQA;
    3. Operation of an industrial site used for mineral processing, including associated on-site structures, equipment, machines, tools or other materials, including the on-site stockpiling and on-site recovery of mined materials. This site must be located on lands approved such uses consistent with the city’s general plan and zoning ordinance, none of the minerals being processed are being extracted on-site, and all reclamation work, if any was necessary, has been completed according to the approved reclamation plan for any mineral extraction activities that occurred on-site after January 1, 1976;
    4. Surface mining operations where a total of one thousand cubic yards or less of the minerals and/or overburden is removed or involve an area of one acre or less in any one location;
    5. Surface mining operations that are required by federal law in order to protect a mining claim, if those operations are conducted solely for that purpose;
    6. The solar evaporation of water for the production of salt and related minerals;
    7. Emergency excavations or grading conducted by or under direction of the city, Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board for the purpose of averting, alleviating, repairing or restoring damage to property due to imminent or recent floods, disasters or other emergencies;
    8. Surface mining operations conducted by, under contract with, or under direction of the State Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board for the State Water Resources Development System or flood control meeting the requirements for review and approval of the State Department of Conservation in accordance with PRC Section 2714(i);
    9. Any other surface mining operations that the State Mining and Geology Board determines to be of an infrequent nature and which involve only minor surface disturbances. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.030)

17.62.040 Vested rights.
Any person with an existing surface mining operation who obtained a vested right to conduct such activity prior to January 1, 1976, shall not be required to secure a permit to mine, so long as the vested right continues and as long as no substantial changes have occurred to the operation. Where a person with vested rights has continued surface mining in the same area after January 1, 1976, he or she shall obtain city approval of a reclamation plan covering any new mined lands disturbed since that date. In those cases where an overlap of the physical disturbance exists in the horizontal and/or vertical sense between pre- and post-Act mining, the reclamation plan shall call for reclamation proportional to the disturbance caused by mining after the effective date of the Act (January 1, 1976). All other requirements of state law and this chapter shall apply to vested surface mining operations. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.76.040)

17.62.050 Permit review procedure.
A. Application. A conditional use permit shall be required for all applications for a surface mining operation or land reclamation project, including any reclamation plan and financial assurance. The application for the permit shall be filed with the planning director on forms provided by the director, and shall include all information as necessary to meet city ordinances, CEQA, SMARA and any other information that the director finds necessary to ensure that the project can be adequately evaluated.
B. Authority. The board of zoning adjustment (BZA) shall have the authority to grant or deny, subject to appeal to the city council, the following:
    1. A conditional use permit to conduct surface mining operation;
    2. A reclamation plan;
    3. Financial assurance for reclamation of mined lands;
    4. Amendments to any term, condition or other consideration regarding a surface mining operation, reclamation plan or financial assurance;
    5. An interim management plan as defined in SMARA for idle surface mining operations;
    6. Environmental determinations concerning the conditional use permit for surface mining operations;
    7. Revocation of the conditional use permit.
C. Review Process. The procedures contained in Chapter 17.64 relating to processing a conditional use permit, including but not limited to, notice, public hearings, permit rights and restrictions, extensions and appeals shall apply to any project regulated by this chapter.
D. Additional Notice. In addition to the notice required under the conditional use procedure and CEQA, notice shall also be provided as follows:
    1. Within thirty days of acceptance of an application as complete, the Planning Director shall notify the State Department of Conservation of the filing of the application.
    2. If mining operations are proposed in the one hundred-year floodplain of any watercourse as shown in Zone A of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and within one mile, upstream or downstream, of any state highway bridge, the planning director shall notify the State Department of Transportation that the application has been received.
    3. The above notifications may be combined with any other notice or consultation necessary to meet CEQA requirements.
E. Agency Consultation and Comments. In addition to the consultation and comment period required by city ordinance and CEQA, the State Department of Conservation shall be given thirty days to review and comment on a reclamation plan and forty-five days to review and comment on a financial assurance (PRC Section 2774(d)). The BZA shall consider all written comments received, if any, from the State Department of Conservation and any other person or agency during the comment period.
F. Required Findings. In addition to any findings required by Chapter 17.64 for conditional use permits, an approval for a surface mining operation, reclamation plan and financial assurance shall include findings that the project complies with the provisions of SMARA and related state regulations.
G. Distribution of Final Decision. In addition to the final decision being distributed to interested persons and/or agencies as may be required by city ordinance and CEQA, a copy of each approved and/or amended conditional use permit for a surface mining operation, reclamation plan and/or financial assurance shall also be forwarded to the State Department of Conservation.
H. Amendments. Amendments to any approved surface mining operation, reclamation plan and/or financial assurance, shall be processed in the same manner as a new application. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.050)

17.62.060 Reclamation plan.
A. All reclamation plans shall comply with the provisions of SMARA (Sections 2772 and 2773) and state regulations (CCR Sections 3500-3505). Reclamation plans approved after January 15,1993, reclamation plans for proposed new mining operations and any substantial amendments to previously approved reclamation plans, shall also comply with the requirements for reclamation performance standards (CCR Sections 3700-3713).
B. The city may impose additional performance standards as developed either in review of individual projects through the conditional use permit process, as warranted, or through the formulation and adoption of citywide performance standards.
C. Reclamation activities shall be initiated at the earliest possible time on those portions of the mined lands that will not be subject to further disturbance. Interim reclamation may also be required for mined lands that have been disturbed and that may be disturbed again in future operations. Reclamation may be done on an annual basis, in stages compatible with continuing operations, or upon completion of all excavation, removal or fill, as approved by the city. Each phase of reclamation shall be specifically described in the reclamation plan and shall include the beginning and expected ending dates for each phase, all reclamation activities anticipated and estimated costs for completion of each phase of reclamation.
D. The reclamation plan shall remain in effect until all components are satisfied. It shall be binding to any new operator or owner that may assume control of the surface mining operation. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.060)

17.62.070 Financial assurance.
A. To ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the city shall require, as a condition of approval, security which will be released upon satisfactory performance of reclaiming mined land. The applicant may pose security in the form of a surety bond, trust fund, an irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial institution, or other method acceptable to the city and the State Department of Mining and Geology Board as specified in regulation, and which the city reasonably determines is adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the reclamation plan. Financial assurance shall be made payable to both the city and the State Department of Conservation.
B. Financial assurance shall be required to ensure compliance with elements of the reclamation plan, including but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitats, restoration of water bodies and water quality, slope stability and erosion and drainage control, disposal of hazardous materials and other measures as may be appropriate by the BZA.
C. Cost estimates for the financial assurance shall be submitted to the planning director as part of the initial application for the surface mining operation. The planning director shall forward a copy of the cost estimates, together with any documentation received supporting the amount of the cost estimates, to the State Department of Conservation for review. If the state does not comment within the required review period, it shall be assumed that the cost estimates are adequate. The BZA shall have the discretion to approve the financial assurance if it meets the requirements of this chapter, SMARA and related state regulations.
D. The amount of the financial assurance shall be based upon the estimated costs of reclamation for the years or phases stipulated in the reclamation plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas as may be required. Cost estimates shall be prepared by a qualified professional retained by the operator that has been approved by the planning director. The estimated amount of the financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities necessary to implement the reclamation plan, including administrative costs. Financial assurance to ensure compliance with revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat and any other applicable element of the approved reclamation plan shall be based upon cost estimates that include but may not be limited to labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration and reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee. A contingency factor of ten percent shall be added to the cost of financial assurances.
E. In projecting the costs of financial assurance, it shall be assumed without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the city may need to contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site.
F. The financial assurance shall remain in effect for the duration of the surface mining operation. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.070)

17.62.080 Idle operations—Interim management plan.
A. Within ninety days of a surface mining operation becoming idle, the operator shall submit to the planning director a proposed interim management plan (IMP). The proposed IMP shall fully comply with the requirements of SMARA and the approved conditional use permit, and shall provide measures the operator will implement to maintain the site in a stable condition, taking into consideration public health and safety. The proposed IMP shall be processed as an amendment to the reclamation plan. IMPs shall not be considered a project for the purposes of environmental review as specified under SMARA.
B. Financial assurances for idle operations shall be maintained as though the operation were active.
C. The IMP may remain in effect for a period not to exceed five years, at which time the BZA may renew the IMP for another period not to exceed five years, or require the surface mining operator to commence reclamation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. (Ord. 3943 § 5, 1999; prior code § 17.75.080)

17.62.090 Annual report.

*Prior ordinance history: Ord. 3919.

17.66.010 Purpose and intent.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to define and implement the goals and policies of the Metropolitan Bakersfield 2010 general plan as they relate to the preservation and maintenance of hillsides as a scenic resource of the City and to protect the general public from the threat of wildfire, hillside instability and landslides. The HD (Hillside Development) zone district is an overlay zone. The regulations established by the HD district are in addition to those uses allowed and the regulations of the base zone district.
B. Development projects within the HD zone shall be subject to review to ensure hillside/open space development policies in the general plan are incorporated into the projects. In addition, the city council shall adopt development standards by resolution or ordinance which aid in the implementation of general plan policies and ordinances, and provide detailed written or pictorial depictions regarding policy and/or ordinance intent.
C. The following provisions of this chapter are intended to apply to areas zoned HD. This overlay zone will generally be applicable to those larger contiguous areas generally having average natural slopes of eight percent or more (see Exhibit A which is located at the end of this chapter).
D. These regulations shall be implemented when the city considers applications for grading, building permits, parcel maps, tentative tract maps, conditional use permits, zone changes, general plan amendments and site plan review.
    1. Permit development in HD areas that minimizes erosion and geologic hazards and provides for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
    2. Protect views by identifying primary and secondary viewsheds, visual resource areas and slope protection areas within the HD zone (Exhibit B-1 and B-2—Large scale exhibit available for viewing at planning department and on the city of Bakersfield’s website: www.bakersfieldcity.us ).
    These areas are defined as follows:
        a. “Primary viewsheds” are those locations identified along freeways, expressways or arterial roadways from which no structures or portions thereof are visible on a designated Class I visual resource area for a distance of one-half mile (Illustration 1), except as may be allowed under Section 17.66.040(P)(4).
        [IMAGE: <17.66.010_001.png>]
        b. “Secondary viewsheds” are those locations identified along freeways, expressways or arterial roadways from which no more than fifty percent of the height of a structural elevation is visible on a Class II visual resource area for a distance of a mile (Illustration 2), except as may be allowed under Section 17.66.040(P)(4).
        [IMAGE: <17.66.010_002.png>]
        c. “Class I visual resources areas” are designated ridge and hilltop areas which require a structural setback great enough so that no portion of a structure is visible from a primary viewshed
        d. “Class II visual resource areas” are designated ridge and hilltop areas which require a structural setback great enough so that no more than fifty percent of the height of a structural elevation is visible from a secondary viewshed
        e. “Slope protection areas” are those mapped slopes of fifteen percent and greater (Exhibits B-1 and B-2) within the HD zone area that, due to physical constraints, aesthetic value and visibility from major roadways, are to be left in their natural state with no structures or fences allowed on the slope face. Areas identified as slope protection areas shall be identified as lettered nonbuildable lots on subdivision maps.
3. Encourage development design that will:
    a. Allow for orderly and sensitive development at a density that respects and is reflective of the natural terrain;

        a. Graded slopes on the exterior of subdivisions shall be rounded and shaped to simulate the natural terrain,
        b. Grading shall follow the natural contours as much as possible,
        c. Graded slopes shall blend with naturally occurring slopes at a radius compatible with the existing natural terrain,
        d. Graded slopes outside the public right-of-way and maintained by a homeowners association shall be revegetated with at least a mixture of native grass seed or shrubs as recommended by the recreation and parks department. Planting may be waived by the recreation and parks department for slopes that, due to the amount of rock material or poor soil, will not support plant growth. In this case, alternative methods of protection and/or aesthetic mitigation may be examined or required at the discretion of the recreation and parks department,
        e. For graded slopes within the public right-of-way or publicly maintained landscape easements, an erosion control and landscaping concept plan shall be submitted to the recreation and parks department for approval,
        f. Unless a flatter slope is otherwise recommended in a soil investigation, the steepest manufactured slope allowed shall not exceed 2 unit horizontal to 1 unit vertical. All manufactured slopes steeper than 5 unit horizontal to 1 unit vertical shall have a type of slope protection as approved by the city engineer, building official and/or the recreation and parks department (as applicable),
        g. Only slopes within public rights-of-way or easements constructed to city standards and accepted for maintenance by the city shall be maintained by a city maintenance district. All other slopes shall be maintained by the property owner or private association unless approved by the recreation and parks department. (Ord. 4391 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006)

17.68.010 Purpose.
This chapter specifies the manner in which legal nonconforming uses and structures may or may not continue. It is intended to prevent such uses or structures from expanding except under certain circumstances. It also establishes criteria by which such uses or structures may be abated or removed in an equitable, reasonable, and timely manner without infringing on the constitutional rights of property owners. (Ord. 3741 § 4, 1997)

17.68.020 Legal nonconforming structures.
A legal nonconforming structure may be continued and maintained as follows:
A. A legal nonconforming structure may be restored if it is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy, up to its pre-damage size and placement. However, the property on which the restored structure is situated shall be subject to all other current ordinances. Building permits for reconstruction shall be obtained within two years and be completed within three years of the date of the damage.
B. A legal nonconforming structure or any part of it that is voluntarily destroyed or removed, shall lose all nonconforming status for any part or parts affected and may not be reconstructed.
C. A legal nonconforming structure may be increased in area or volume if the addition complies with this title and the most recent city adopted Building Code.
D. A legal nonconforming structure may be used for any use that conforms to the zone district in which it is located and complies with the most recent city adopted Building Code. Such structure will not lose its nonconforming status if it has been vacant for any time.
E. A legal nonconforming structure may be repaired or altered, including structural alterations to bearing walls, columns, beams and girders. All work shall meet the requirements of the most recent city adopted Building Code.
F. A legal nonconforming accessory structure may be used or converted to any use consistent with the zoning district in which it is located, and the most recent city adopted Building Code. Such structure will not lose its nonconforming status if it has been vacant for any time. (Ord. 4715 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4559 § 1, 2009; Ord. 3741 § 4, 1997)

17.68.030 Legal nonconforming uses.

A. No increase in intensity, or of the area, space, or volume occupied or devoted to a legal nonconforming use, except as allowed under Section 17.68.040, shall be permitted.
B. Change of ownership, tenancy or management of a legal nonconforming use shall not affect its legal nonconforming status, provided the specific use and intensity of use do not change, except as allowed under Section 17.68.040.
C. A legal nonconforming use that has ceased or been abandoned for a continuous period of one year or more shall lose its nonconforming status, and the continued use of that property or structure shall conform to the regulations of the zone district in which it is located, except as allowed under Section 17.68.040. If the legal nonconforming use is cultivated agricultural land that is fallow for longer than the one-year period but no more than a contiguous period of three years, it is not considered abandoned if it is part of a managed agricultural operation where such land is planned for continued cultivation.
D. If a legal nonconforming use involves the keeping of animals, then the number of animals, types of animals, minimum lot area for animals, or other standards for the keeping of animals not in conformance with the zone district in which they are located, may be continued until the owner or occupant removes them for a continuous period of one year or more.
E. Additional uses are allowed on property that contains a legal nonconforming use provided those uses meet all requirements and regulations of the zone district in which they are located, and do not result in the nonconforming use expanding as restricted in subsection A of this section.
F. If a legal nonconforming use is converted to a conforming use, no previous nonconforming use may be resumed.
G. Repairs and alterations may be made to structures containing legal nonconforming uses, including structural alterations to bearing walls, columns, beams and girders. All work shall meet the requirements of the most recent city adopted Building Code.
H. A structure containing a legal nonconforming use may be restored up to its pre-damaged size and density if it is involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, other catastrophic event, or the public enemy. However, the property on which the restored use is situated shall be subject to all current ordinances. Building permits for reconstruction of the structure shall be obtained within two years and be completed within three years of the date of damage if the use is reestablished.

Sections:
17.69.010    Purpose.
17.69.020    Definitions.
17.69.030    Development requirements.
17.69.040    Separation and distance requirements.

17.69.070    Regulations nonexclusive.
*Prior ordinance history:  Ordinances 2877, 2926 and 2943.

17.69.010 Purpose.
A. It is found, and experience has demonstrated, that certain adult-oriented businesses, because of their very nature, are recognized as having significant deleterious secondary effects on the community which include, but are not limited to: depreciated property values and increased vacancy in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of the adult-oriented businesses; higher crime rates, noise, debris or vandalism in the vicinity of adult-oriented businesses; and blighting conditions such as low-level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. The concentration of such uses substantially contributes to blighting and downgrading adjacent residential and commercial areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to preserve the integrity of existing commercial areas of the city and of residential areas in close proximity to such commercial uses. In furtherance of the public interest and general welfare, the primary purpose of this chapter is to deconcentrate and to prevent the concentration of these businesses in any one area. It is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communication material. Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials or merchandise protected by the First Amendment, or deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of adult-oriented business to their intended market.
B. Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the state regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. (Ord. 4108 § 1, 2003; Ord. 2961 § 1, 1985)

17.71.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to minimize light trespass, excessive glare and sky glow caused by inappropriate or misaligned light fixtures. Properly designed lighting will provide the proper amount of illumination appropriate for the required task that will not cause unpleasant or adverse effects upon adjacent properties, and will enhance nighttime views of the sky. These standards will:
A. Promote a safe and pleasant nighttime environment for businesses, residents and visitors;
B. Protect and improve public safety and security;
C. Prevent nuisances caused by unnecessary light intensity, glare, and light trespass;
D. Protect the ability to view the night sky by restricting unnecessary upward projection of light;
E. Enhance the aesthetics of the built environment and protect the character of the natural environment; and
F. Promote energy conservation. (Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.020 Applicability.
A. The provisions of this chapter only apply to Northeast Bakersfield, which is the geographic area that includes all lands in the city limits east of Fairfax Road (and any northern extension thereof) and north of the Union Pacific Railroad that parallels Edison Highway.
B. All outdoor lighting fixtures installed on private and public property after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall comply with these standards.
C. This chapter does not apply to interior lighting. However, overly bright inside light emitted outdoors from any structure, including through the roof, will be subject to control by this chapter if it is determined by the planning director that it creates a nuisance to adjacent properties, negatively impacts safe travel along streets, or contributes to sky glow.
D. All existing outdoor lighting fixtures legally installed and operative before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are not subject to these requirements. However, the planning director may at any time, require appropriate action be taken in accordance with this chapter if it is determined that lighting from any outdoor fixtures creates a nuisance to adjacent properties or negatively impacts safe travel along streets.
E. At such time changes or modifications occur on the site that necessitates a site plan review pursuant to Chapter 17.08 or other discretionary approval, the decision-making body shall determine whether some or all the requirements of this chapter will be implemented under said approval.
F. When existing lighting fixtures are replaced, replacement fixtures and light emanating from them shall meet the requirements of this chapter.
G. All governmental agencies, including their security facilities which operate within the city limits, should comply with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 4635 § 1, 2010; Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.030 General standards.
The following standards shall apply to all outdoor lighting installed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in chapter:
A. Outdoor lighting must be fully shielded and aimed downward. Fully shielded denotes lighting fixtures that are shielded, focused, or constructed so that light rays do not project horizontally or vertically. The shield must be arranged in such a manner that light rays emitted from the device or fixture, whether directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below the horizontal plane at the lowest point on the fixture where the light is emitted. The light must be aimed to ensure that the illumination is only pointing downward onto the ground surface with no escaping light permitted to contribute to sky glow by shining upward into the sky. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable lighting fixtures are shown in Section 17.71.080.
B. Post-top luminaries, which may also be referred to as period lighting or historical lighting, shall have built-in reflectors that effectively eliminate up-lighting.
C. Any outdoor lighting that shines onto adjacent property or streets that produce a nuisance or disabling glare, or that is above the horizontal plane, shall not be permitted.
D. Light trespass that extends beyond the property or project boundaries within or adjacent to residentially zoned and/or designated properties shall not exceed an intensity level of 0.5 foot-candles at the property line as measured three feet above the ground or finished grade. This light intensity maximum shall also apply to lands zoned and/or designated agriculture, parks, and open space.
E. Light fixtures mounted under a canopy shall be recessed so that lighting is fully shielded by either the roof or canopy fascia and is projected below the horizontal plane as stated in subsection A of this section. Lights shall not be mounted on either the top or sides of a canopy.
F. Up-lighting is only permitted if it is effectively contained and will not shine beyond the intended target into the night sky. Containment of lighting may include, but is not limited to, overhanging architectural elements such as eaves or awnings, or landscaping such as dense shrubs or dense evergreen tree canopies.
G. Outlining of a building by means of neon, LED or other lighting shall be effectively contained to not shine into the night sky. Containment of lighting may include, but is not limited to, overhanging architectural elements such as eaves or awnings, or use of backlighting techniques.
H. Existing fixtures may be adapted to comply with this chapter by adding a properly designed shield or by pointing any upward-mounted, shielded fixture downward towards the ground surface.
I. Lighting sources, fixtures and related structures shall be maintained in sound operating condition at all times. Maintenance shall include, but is not limited to, replacement of broken lenses, burned out light sources, adjustments to fixture tilt, cleaning of fixtures and lenses, painting of standards, and replacement or adjustments to shields and/or baffles.
J. All fixture installations shall meet the most recent applicable regulations of the Building Code, the Electrical Code, Title 24, and any other related health, safety, and energy codes as they pertain to lighting and light fixtures as adopted by the city. (Ord. 4715 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.040 Additional standards for specific uses.
In addition to the general standards contained in Section 17.71.030, the following shall apply to the specific use identified below:
A. Parking Lots and Garages. 
    1. Lighting shall be in accordance with the provisions in Section 17.58.060(B).
B. Outdoor Performance, Sports, and Recreation Facilities. 
    1. Where playing fields or other special activity areas are to be illuminated, lighting fixtures shall be mounted, aimed, and shielded so that their beams fall within the primary playing area and immediate surroundings within the project site. Illumination should be no greater than the minimum recommended levels established by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) for the type of activity. Illumination should also meet, without exceeding, the IESNA recommendations for the IESNA defined illumination class appropriate for the predominant use of the facility.
    2. The main lighting shall be turned off within one hour or as soon as possible following the end of an event. Where feasible, a low level lighting system may be used immediately following events to facilitate patrons leaving the facility, cleanup, maintenance, and other closing activities.
    3. Because lighted fields and other lighted outdoor facilities may also be subject to discretionary approval, operational regulations, and the standards in this chapter may be further restricted, modified or otherwise conditioned by the board of zoning adjustment, planning commission, or city council. (Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.050 Energy conservation.
Incorrect installations, poor choice of fixtures, and over-lighting can result in unnecessarily high energy costs. The following recommendations are intended to encourage the efficient use of energy for lighting purposes:
A. All nonessential outdoor commercial and residential lighting should be turned off after business hours when it is not necessary for public safety or when an activity needing such light is not in use.
B. Lighting levels may be reduced after hours to provide minimal visibility without compromising security.
C. Where practical, outdoor lighting installations should include timers, dimmers, sensors, or photocell controllers that turn the lights off during daylight hours to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate unnecessary lighting. Sensor activated fixtures should not be triggered by activities off the subject property.
D. When selecting new outdoor lighting, the full cost of operation over the life of the fixture(s) should be considered. Substantial annual energy savings may be realized by using quality efficient fixtures and light sources, the lowest wattage for the intended task, and alternative sources of power such as wind or solar, when feasible.
E. Indiscriminate and excessive lighting should be avoided. Light should be directed only where it is needed, when it is needed, with the appropriate intensity. (Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.060 Exemptions.
The following are exempt from the provisions of this chapter:
A. Traffic control signals and devices;
B. Temporary emergency related lighting (e.g. fire, police, utility repair);
C. Moving vehicle lights;
D. Navigation lights (e.g., airports, heliports, radio/television towers);

F. Seasonal decorations provided they are not in use longer than sixty consecutive days;
G. Temporary or periodic events with temporary lighting as approved by the city (e.g., rodeos, revivals, fairs, fiestas, carnivals). Permanent lighting installations must conform to the requirements of this chapter;
H. Lighting on any single-family residentially zoned lot, or multiple-family residentially zoned lot that contains four units or less;
I. All outdoor light fixtures lawfully installed and operating prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. This exemption shall not apply if an existing light fixture is replaced. The addition of supplementary shielding and/or re-aiming of existing fixtures that shine direct illumination or visible glare beyond the property line where the fixture is installed are encouraged;
J. Decorative low voltage (12V) lighting used to highlight driveways, landscaping, artwork and buildings providing they are properly aimed and shielded to not shine visible glare into the public right-of-way or onto adjacent or nearby properties;
K. Flag poles with the United States, state, foreign or municipal flags displayed by fully shielded top-mounted light. If up-lighting is used, it shall be placed as close to the base of the pole as possible with a narrow cone or spread focused to minimize light spill into the night sky or onto adjacent properties;
L. Temporary lighting for television or movie film productions, roadway or utility construction or building construction. Permanent lighting installations must conform to the requirements of this chapter;
M. Emergency exiting or other public safety related lighting under the applicable California Code;
N. Underwater lighting to illuminate swimming pools, and other water features provided they meet all required Building, Electrical and other safety codes as adopted by the city. (Ord. 4715 § 1, 2012; Ord. 4617 § 6, 2010)

17.71.070 Prohibitions.
