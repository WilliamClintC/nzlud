This shall be in addition to the record required to be kept under subsection A of this section.

A. If the tax collector determines that noncompliance with tax obligations results from extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of provisions of this chapter, it may enter into closing agreements with those taxpayers under the following terms and conditions:

1. Extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws occurs if the tax collector determines that more than 60 percent of the persons in the affected class have failed to properly account for their taxes owing to the same misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws.

2. The tax collector shall publicly declare the nature of the possible misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected taxpayers and shall conduct a public hearing to hear testimony regarding the extent of the misapplication and the definition of the affected class.

3. If, after the public hearing, the tax collector determines that a class of affected taxpayers has failed to comply with their tax obligations, because of extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws, it shall issue a tax ruling announcing that finding and publish the ruling in a newspaper of general circulation in the town and through the next two model city tax code updates.

4. A closing agreement under this section may abate some or all of the penalties, interest and tax that taxpayers have failed to remit, or the agreement may provide for the prospective treatment of the matter as to the class of affected taxpayers.

5. Taxpayers in the affected class who have properly accounted for their tax obligations for these tax periods shall be offered the opportunity to enter into an equivalent closing agreement providing for a pro rata credit or refund of their taxes previously paid.

a. Within 45 days of receipt by the taxpayer of notice of a determination by the tax collector that a tax, penalty, or interest amount is due, or that a request for refund or credit has been denied; or

b. By voluntary payment of any contested amount when accompanied by a timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of the protested portion of said payment; or

c. By petition accompanying a timely filed return contesting an amount reported but not paid; or

d. By petition requesting review of denial of waiver of penalty as provided in STC 3.05.540(G).

2. Extension to File a Petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may request only one extension from the tax collector. Such request must be in writing, state the reasons for the requested delay and time of delay requested, and must be filed with the tax collector within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition. The tax collector shall allow such extension to file a petition, when such written request has been properly and timely made by the taxpayer, but such extension shall not exceed 45 days beyond the time provided for originally filing a petition.

3. Requirements for Petition.

a. The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the amount of reduction or refund requested. The petition may be amended at any time prior to the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such time as the hearing officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of redeterminations without hearings. The hearing officer may require that amendments be in writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable period of time to file the amendment. The hearing officer shall provide a reasonable period of time for the tax collector to review and respond to the petition and to any written amendments.

b. The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a hearing which shall be granted by the hearing officer. If no request for hearing is made, the petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision by the hearing officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any reply made by the tax collector.

c. The provisions of this section are exclusive, and no petition seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered unless the petition is timely and properly filed under this section.

The tax collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to the municipal tax hearing office (MTHO) within 20 days after receipt, accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the hearing officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper form, he shall notify both the taxpayer and the tax collector; and in cases of petitions not in proper form only, the hearing officer shall provide the taxpayer with an extension up to 45 days to correct the petition.

5. Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing officer and shall be continuous until the hearing officer closes the record. The taxpayer may be heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. Hearings shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and presentation of evidence. The hearing officer shall admit evidence over hearsay objections where the offered evidence has substantial probative value and reliability. Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the ordinary course of business may be admitted, without objection as to foundation, but subject to argument as to weight, admissibility, and authenticity.

C. Stipulations That Future Tax Is Also Protested. A taxpayer may enter into a stipulation with the tax collector that future taxes of similar nature are also at issue in any protest or appeal. However, unless such stipulation is made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely and exclusively with the tax specifically protested and no other. When a taxpayer enters into such a stipulation with the tax collector that future taxes of similar nature will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or court case, it is the burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and keep record of such income or protested taxable amount in his books and records in the same manner as the taxpayer is required to segregate exempt income.

D. When an Assessment Is Final.

1. If a request for administrative review and petition for hearing or redetermination of an assessment made by the tax collector is not filed within the period required by subsection B of this section, such person shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount determined to be due and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due shall be final as provided in STC 3.05.545(A) and 3.05.555(F).

2. The decision made by the hearing officer upon administrative review by hearing or redetermination shall become final 30 days after the taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment required by subsection (B)(8) of this section, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or decision in the manner provided in STC 3.05.575.

E. The provisions of the state taxpayer bill of rights (ARS 42-2051 et seq.) shall not apply. [Ord. 2007-09 § 1; prior code § 8-570.]

The taxpayer, however, may stay collection by filing, within 10 days after receipt of notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the tax collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the town in the amount the tax collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice.

C. “Bond or collateral,” as required by this section:

A. In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in this town code that may apply, the tax collector may apply the provisions of subsections B through D of this section concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation of business.

B. The taxes imposed by this title are a lien on the property of any person subject to this title who sells his business or stock of goods, or quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of the tax within 15 days after selling or quitting his business.

C. Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale under trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other method, improved real property or a portion of improved real property for which the privilege tax imposed by this title has not been paid shall be responsible for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner-builder, as provided in STC 3.05.416 and 3.05.417.

1. Any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of a creditor, who acquires improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor’s debtor by any means set forth in this subsection C, shall pay the tax based on the amount received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of such improved real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless of when such subsequent sale takes place. Such tax shall be due in the month following the month in which the sale of the improved real property by the creditor or its affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the real property meets the definition of “partially improved residential real property” in STC 3.05.416(A)(4) and all of the requirements of STC 3.05.416(B)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction, then the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale.

2. In the event a creditor or its affiliate uses the acquired improved real property for any business purpose, other than operating the property in the manner in which it was operated or was intended to be operated before the acquisition, or in any other manner unrelated to selling the property, the tax shall be due. The gross income upon which the tax shall be determined pursuant to STC 3.05.416 and 3.05.417 shall be the fair market value of the improved real property as of the date of acquisition. The tax shall be due in the month following the month in which such first business use occurs. When applicable, the credit bid shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of acquisition.

3. Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has occurred and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it pursuant to this subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any future owner, shall be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest that may continue to be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the debtor to the creditor or its affiliate.

4. If the tax liability imposed by either STC 3.05.416 or 3.05.417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the creditor or its affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the tax collector by the debtor subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its affiliate, the amount so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably determined by the tax collector in good faith, against the tax imposed on the creditor or its affiliate by either subsection (C)(1) or (2) of this subsection.

5. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, if a creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in subsection (C)(1) or (2) of this section and such creditor or affiliate has not previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due.

D. A person’s successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and interest or penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax collector showing that all town tax has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the tax collector. The tax collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate within 15 days by either providing the certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued.

1. If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate from the tax collector.

2. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to obtain a certificate as provided by this section, he is personally liable for payment of the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on account of the business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by the former owner or assignees.

Regulations

Reg. 3-100.1. Brokers.

(a) For the purposes of proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of taxes imposed, brokers shall be wherever necessary treated as taxpayers for all purposes, and shall file a return and remit the tax imposed on the activity on behalf of the principal. No deduction shall be allowed for any commissions or fees retained by such broker, except as provided in STC 3.05.405, relating to advertising commissions.

(b) Brokers for vendors. A broker acting for a seller, lessor, or other similar person deriving gross income in a category upon which this chapter imposes a tax shall be liable for such tax, even if his principal would not be subject to the tax if he conducted such activity in his own behalf, by reason of the activity being deemed a “casual” one. For example:

(1) An auctioneer or other sales agent of tangible personal property is subject to the tax imposed upon retail sales, even if such sales would be deemed “casual” if his principal had sold such items himself.

(2) A property manager is subject to the tax imposed upon rental, leasing, or licensing of real property, even if such rental, leasing, or licensing would be deemed “casual” if his principal managed such real property himself.

(c) Brokers for vendees. A broker acting solely for a buyer, lessee, tenant, or other similar person who is a party to a transaction which may be subject to the tax, shall be liable for such tax and for filing a return in connection with such tax only to the extent his principal is subject to the tax.

(d) The liability of a broker does not relieve the principal of liability except upon presentation to the tax collector of proof of payment of the tax, and only to the extent of the correct payment. The broker shall be relieved of the responsibility to file and pay taxes upon the filing and correct payment of such taxes by the principal.

(e) (Reserved).

(f) Location of Business. Retail sales by brokers acting for another person shall be deemed to have occurred at the regular business location of the broker, in a manner similar to that used to determine “out-of-town sales”; provided, however, that an auctioneer is deemed to be engaged in business at the site of each auction.

Reg. 3-100.2. Delivery, installation, or other direct customer services.

(a) “Delivery Charges” exist only when the total charges to the ultimate customer or consumer include, as separately charged to the ultimate customer, charges for delivery to the ultimate consumer, whether the place of delivery is within or without the town, and when the taxpayer’s books and records show the separate delivery charges.

(1) Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed price has “delivery included” or other similar expression is insufficient to show the delivery as a separate charge. Only the separately stated charge for the delivery shall be deemed a “delivery charge”.

(2) Freight-in. Charges for delivery from place of production or the manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of wholesalers or jobbers or other middlemen are deemed “freight-in” and are not considered delivery.

(b) “Installation”, as used in this definition, relates only to tangible personal property. Installation to real property is deemed construction contracting in this chapter. Examples of installation relating to tangible personal property are: installing a radio in an automobile; applying sun screens on the windows of a boat; installing cabinets, carpeting, or “built-in appliances” to a camper or motorized recreational vehicle.

(c) Repair of tangible personal property is not included in this definition. See Regulation 3-465.1.

(d) “Direct Customer Services” means services other than repair rendered directly to the customer. Services or labor provided by any person prior to the transfer of tangible personal property to the customer or consumer are not included in this definition. In the following examples, the requirements of subsection (e) below are referred to by the words “identify” or “identification.”

(1) A retailer sells a customer a $100 “plug-in” appliance, with a $25 delivery and installation charge. If the retailer identifies the $25 delivery and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services.

(2) A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink served, $300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and waiters. If all charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set-up and cleanup is a charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food and service is restauranting gross income.

(3) Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or persons engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such charges for labor as direct customer services.

(4) All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a photograph (sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching, etc.) for services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property are not direct customer services.

(5) An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may consider such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if such charge is properly identified.

(6) Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the production of any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry, artwork, tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as such labor occurs prior to the transfer of property.

(e) Recordkeeping requirements.

(1) Any person who engages in transactions involving these services must:

(A) Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for such services in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily identify the specific dollar amount of the service charge; and

(B) Maintain business books and records in a manner in which the separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the satisfaction of the tax collector.

(2) Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction involving such services and the transfer of tangible personal property which only indicates the total amount of the charges with words such as “services included” or “charge includes labor and parts” or a similar expression does not satisfy the requirements of this subsection.

Reg. 3-100.3. Retailers.

When in the opinion of the tax collector it is necessary for efficient administration of this chapter, he may regard any salesman, representative, peddler, canvasser, or agent of any dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal property for sale, rental, lease, or license as a retailer for the purposes of this chapter, irrespective of whether he is making sales, rentals, leases, or licenses on his own behalf or on behalf of others. The tax collector may also regard such dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer as a retailer for the purposes of this chapter.

Reg. 3-100.4. Out-of-Town/Out-of-State Sales: Sales to Native Americans.

Sales to Native Americans or tribal councils by vendors located within the town shall be deemed sales within the town, unless all of the following conditions exist:

(1) the vendor has properly accounted for such sales, in a manner similar to the recordkeeping requirements for out-of-town sales; and

(2) all of the following elements of the sale exist:

(A) solicitation and placement of the order occurs on the reservation; and

(B) delivery is made to the reservation; and

(C) payment originates from the reservation.

Reg. 3-100.5. Remediation Contracting.

The following activities are considered remediation contracting and are exempt:

(1) excavation, transportation, treatment, and/or disposal of contaminated soil for purposes of site remediation (rather than characterization);

(7) abandonment of groundwater or vapor extraction wells;

(8) removal/demolition of remediation systems;

(A) “Operating Program (Software)” (also called “executive program (software)”), which is the programming system or technical language upon which or by means of which the basic operating procedures of the computer are recorded. The operating program serves as an interface with user applied programs and allows the user to access the computer’s processing capabilities.

(B) “Applied Program (Software)”, which is the programming system or technical language (including the tape, disk, cards, or other medium upon which such language or program is recorded) designed either for application in a specialized use, or upon which or by means of which a plan for the solution of a particular problem is based. Typically, applied programs can be transferred from one computer to another via storage media. Examples of applied programs include: payroll processing, general ledger, sales data, spreadsheet, word processing, and data management programs.

(3) “Storage Medium” is any hard disk, compact disk, floppy disk, diskette, diskpack, magnetic tape, cards, or other medium used for storage of information in a form readable by a computer, but not including the memory of the computer itself.

(2) Computer software which is not custom computer programming. Such prewritten (“canned”) programs may be transferred to a customer in the form of punched cards, magnetic tape, or other storage medium, or by listing the program instructions on coding sheets. Transfer is deemed to have occurred whether title to the storage medium upon which the program is recorded, coded, or punched passes to the customer or the program is recorded, coded, or punched on storage medium furnished by the customer. Gross income from the transfer of such prewritten programs includes:

(A) the entire amount charged to the customer for the sale, rental, lease, or license for use of the storage medium or coding sheets on which or into which the prewritten program has been recorded, coded, or punched.

(B) the entire amount charged for the temporary transfer or possession of a prewritten program to be directly used or to be recorded, coded, or punched by the customer on the customer’s premises.

(C) license fees, royalty fees, or program design fees; any fee present or future, whether for a period of minimum use or of use for extended periods, relating to the use of a prewritten program.

(D) the entire amount charged for transfer of a prewritten (“canned”) program by remote telecommunications from the transferor’s place of business to or through the customer’s computer.

(E) any charge for the purchase of a maintenance contract which entitles the customer to receive storage media on which prewritten program improvements or error corrections have been recorded or to receive telephone or on-site consultation services, provided that:

(i) if such maintenance contract is not optional with the customer, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the prewritten program.

(ii) if such maintenance contract is optional with the customer but the customer does not have the option to purchase the consultation services separately from the storage media containing the improvements or error corrections, then the charges for the maintenance contract, including the consultation services, are deemed gross income from the transfer of the prewritten program.

(iii) if such maintenance contract is optional with the customer and the customer may purchase the consultation services separately from the storage media containing the improvements or error corrections, then only the charges for such improvements or error corrections are deemed gross income from the transfer of a prewritten program and charges for consultation are deemed to be charges for professional services.

(c) Producing the following by means of computer hardware is deemed to be the activity of job printing for the purposes of this chapter:

(1) statistical reports, graphs, diagrams, microfilm, microfiche, photorecordings, or any other information produced or compiled by a computer; except as provided in subsection (e) below.

(C) Custom computer programming includes a program prepared to the special order of a customer who will use the program to produce copies of the program for sale, rental, lease, or license. The subsequent sale, rental, lease, or license of such a program is deemed the sale, rental, lease, or license of a prewritten program.

(2) Training services related to computer hardware or software, provided further that:

(A) the provider of such training services is deemed the ultimate consumer of all tangible personal property used in training others or provided to such trainees without separately itemized charge for the materials provided.

(b) Recordkeeping.

(1) Retailers shall maintain accurate, verifiable, and complete records of all purchases and sales of tangible personal property in order to verify exemptions from taxes imposed by this chapter.

Reg. 3-250.1. Excess tax collected.

If a taxpayer collects taxes in excess of the combined tax rate from any customer in any transaction, all such excess tax shall be paid to the taxing jurisdictions in proportion to their effective rates. The right of the taxpayer to charge his customer for his own liability for tax does not allow the taxpayer to enrich himself at the cost of his customers. Tax paid on an activity that is not subject to tax or that qualifies for an exemption, deduction, exclusion or credit is not excess tax collected. [Ord. 2006-11 § 1(4).]

Reg. 3-270.1. Proprietary activities of municipalities are not considered activities of a governmental entity.

A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary

course of business. The fact that the acquiring person possesses a privilege license number, and makes a verbal claim of “sale for resale or lease” or “lease for release” does not meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The “reasonable evidence” must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business. Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions.

Reg. 3-360.2. Proof of exemption: exemption certificate.

For the purpose of proof of exemption, in transactions other than those in which the proof is set by standard documentation as detailed in Regulations 350.1 and 360.1, the minimum acceptable proof and documentation for each transaction shall be the completion, at the time of the transaction, in all material respects, of a certificate containing all the information set forth below. For the purpose of validating the vendor’s claim of exemption, such certificate is sufficient if executed by any person with apparent authority to act for the customer, and the information provided validates the claim.

Reg. 3-415.1. Distinction between the categories of construction contracting.

For the purposes of this chapter, transactions involving improvements to, or sales of, real property are designated into one of the following categories, and these categorizations shall apply, whether or not a person designates himself as a contractor, construction manager, developer, or otherwise:

(a) A person performing improvements to real property is one of the following:

(1) an “Owner-Builder” when the work is performed by the owner or lessor or lessee-in-possession. An “owner-builder” may also be a “speculative builder”.

(2) a “Construction Contractor” when performing work for the owner or lessor or lessee-in-possession of the real property, unless that person has provided a written declaration stating that:

(A) the owner-builder is improving the property for sale; and

(B) the owner-builder is liable for the tax for such construction contracting activity; and

(C) the owner-builder has provided the contractor his town privilege license number.

(3) a “Subcontractor” as provided in STC 3.05.415(C).

(b) An owner or lessor (“owner-builder”) of improved real property is one of the following:

(1) a “Speculative Builder” as provided in STC 3.05.100; or

(2) an “owner builder who is not a speculative builder” in all other cases.

(c) The terms “owner”, “lessor”, and “lessee-in-possession” shall be deemed to include any authorized agent for such person.

Reg. 3-415.2. Distinction between construction contracting and certain related activities.

(a) Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity. Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For example:

(1) Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment with operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an operator is rental of tangible personal property.

(2) Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of tangible personal property.

(3) Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property, whether or not an operator is provided with the equipment rented.

(b) Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain direct customer service activities.

(1) When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is a construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or replacement of that item is construction contracting.

(2) Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are retail sales.

(3) Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example: carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscaping maintenance).

(4) Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered construction contracting.

(c) Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant, but not paint.

(d) Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.

(1) “Tangible personal property which has independent functional utility” must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without attachment to real property. “Attachment to real property” must include more than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.

(2) Examples of tangible personal property which has independent functional utility include artwork, furnishings, “plug-in” kitchen equipment, or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.

(3) Examples of tangible personal property which does not have independent functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring, wallpaper, kitchen cabinets, or “built-in” dishwashers or ranges.

(4) The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds, etc.) is always a retail activity.

Reg. 3-415.3. Construction contracting; tax rate effective date.

(a) In the event of a tax rate change, the rate imposed on gross income from construction contracting shall be computed based upon the rate in effect when the contract was executed, subject to the “enactment date” as defined in this section. Gross income from a contract executed prior to the enactment date shall not be subject to the tax rate change; provided the contract contains no provision that entitles the construction contractor to recover the amount of the tax.

(b) In the event of a rate increase, in order to qualify for the lower rate, the construction contractor shall, upon request, provide sufficient documentation, in a manner and form prescribed by the tax collector, to verify that a contract was entered into before the enactment date.

(c) For purposes of this section, “enactment date” shall be:

(1) In the event an election is held, the date of election.

(2) In the event no election is held, the date of final adoption by the mayor and council.

(3) Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the town from establishing a later enactment date.

Reg. 3-416.1. Speculative builders: homeowner’s bona fide non-business sale of a family residence.

(a) A sale of a custom home, regardless of the stage of completion of such home shall be considered a “homeowner’s bona fide non-business sale” and not subject to the tax on speculative builders if:

(1) the property was actually used as the principal place of family residence or vacation residence by the immediate family of the seller for the six (6) months next prior to the offer for sale; and

(2) the seller has not sold more than two (2) such residences (or, if the residence is a vacation residence, two (2) such vacation residences) within the thirty-six (36) months immediately prior to the offer for sale; and

(3) the seller has not licensed, leased, or rented the sold premises for any period within twenty-four (24) months prior to the offer for sale.

(b) In the event that a homeowner of a family residence contracts with a licensed construction contractor for improvements to a residence, the construction contracting on a family residence shall be presumed to be for an owner’s bona fide non-business purpose and all construction contractors shall be required to report and pay the tax imposed on all such improvements.

(c) Purchases by a homeowner of tangible personal property for inclusion in any construction, alteration, or repair of his residence shall be subject to tax as retail sales to the ultimate consumer.

(d) “Owner” and “Homeowner” as used in this regulation shall only mean an individual, and no other entity, association, or representative shall qualify; except that an administrator, executor, personal representative, or guardian in guardianship or probate proceedings, for the estate of a deceased or incompetent person or a minor, may claim “homeowner” status for such person if such person would have otherwise qualified with respect to the specific property involved.

Reg. 3-416.2. Reconstruction contracting.

(a) “Reconstruction (of Real Property)” shall mean the subdividing of real property and, in addition, all construction contracting activities performed upon said real property; provided, however, that each of the following conditions are met:

(1) a structure existed on said real property prior to the reconstruction activity; and

(2) the “prior value” of said structure exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the “prior value” of the integrated property (land, improvements, and structure); and

(3) the total cost of all construction contracting activities performed on said real property in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the sale of any part of the real property exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the “prior value” of the real property; and

(4) the structure which existed on the real property prior to the reconstruction activity still exists in some form upon the property, and is included, in whole or in part, in the property sold.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) below, “prior value” means the value of the total integrated property, with improvements, as existing immediately prior to any reconstruction activity. Where, according to title 42 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a property’s full cash value for secondary tax purposes is intended to represent the property’s fair market value, “prior value” shall be the property’s full cash value for secondary property tax purposes as determined by the County Assessor in the year immediately preceding the year in which the reconstruction improvement(s) are or could have been included in the County Assessor’s valuation. If the County Assessor’s valuation is contested or appealed, the final determination at either the administrative or judicial level shall apply. Where, according to title 42 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, a property’s full cash value for secondary property tax purposes is not intended to represent the property’s fair market value, “prior value” shall be the property’s fair market value prior to the reconstruction improvement(s).

(c) “Alternative Prior Value” shall mean that as an alternative to the “prior value” defined above, the taxpayer may use his actual cost of the reconstructed property prior to reconstruction, provided that evidence of such cost is presented to the tax collector and is determined by the tax collector, in his sole discretion, to be satisfactory. Such evidence shall consist, at a minimum, of proof of the actual, arms-length acquisition price, accompanied by a full appraisal of all property involved which appraisal shall have been performed by a real estate broker or MAI appraiser specifically for the purpose of assisting in the acquisition and further shall have been performed on behalf of the seller or a lending institution which has lent at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the acquisition price. (Only long-term lending -not interim or construction financing will be considered.) This alternative value shall be used only if the property was acquired by the reconstruction taxpayer not more than thirty-six (36) months prior to a “sale” as defined below.

(d) A “sale” for the purpose of determining “alternative prior value” or “reconstruction” only shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the execution of a contract of sale or a deed (joint tenancy or warranty) whichever is earlier, to a purchaser or grantee of any single residential or other occupancy unit. In addition to the foregoing, a lease with option to purchase a single residential unit shall be considered a “sale” at the date of execution of such lease if said option is exercisable by the lessee in not later than nine (9) months. Further in the case of cooperative apartments, the sale date shall be the date of execution of the contract selling (subject or not to encumbrances, liens or security interests) of a share, or a sufficient number of shares which entitle the purchaser to the occupancy of a residential unit. In all cases a person shall include a husband and wife as a community, or any co-occupants of a single unit as joint tenants.

Reg. 3-425.1. Distinction between job printing and certain related activities.

(a) Computerized Printing. Computerized versions of all items which would be taxable under STC 3.05.425 if performed without computerized assistance are considered taxable under that section, and therefore, are not exempt services.

(b) Book publishing. The printing of books shall be deemed job printing. Sales of books shall be deemed retail sales.

(c) Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not be considered job printing for the purposes of this chapter.

Reg. 3-435.1. Distinction between publishing of periodicals and certain related activities.

(a) Book publishing shall not be considered publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals for purposes of this chapter. Sales of books shall be deemed retail sales. The printing of books shall be deemed job printing.

(b) Publication of newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals shall not be considered job printing for the purposes of this chapter.

Reg. 3-435.2. Advertising income of publishers and distributors of newspapers and other periodicals.

Publishers and distributors of newspapers and other periodicals shall be subject to the tax upon advertising imposed by STC 3.05.405 and such tax shall be allocated in the manner prescribed by STC 3.05.435(E).

Reg. 3-445.1. (Reserved)

Reg. 3-445.3. Rental, leasing, and licensing of real property as lodging: room and board; furnished lodging.

(a) Room and board.

(1) Rooming houses, lodges, or other establishments providing both lodging and meals, shall maintain a record of the separate charges made for the lodging and the meals.

(2) The charge for lodging shall be subject to the tax imposed by STC 3.05.444 or 3.05.445. The charge for meals is subject to the tax upon restaurants and bars prescribed by STC 3.05.455.

(b) Furnished lodging. A person who provides lodging with furnishings shall be deemed to be only in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of lodging, and not in the business of rental, leasing, and licensing of such furnishings as tangible personal property, unless:

(1) Any tenant of any lodging space may choose to rent, lease, or license such lodging space either furnished or unfurnished; and

(2) The lessor separately charges tenants for lodging and for furnishings; and

(3) The lessor separately maintains his gross income from lodging and from furnishings separately in his accounting books and records.

Reg. 3-447.1. (Repealed by Ord. 2006-16)

Reg. 3-450.1. Distinction between rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal property and certain related activities.

(a) Certain rentals, leases, and licenses for use in connection with construction contracting. Rental, leasing, or licensing of earthmoving equipment with an operator shall be deemed construction contracting activity. Rental, leasing, or licensing of any other tangible personal property (with or without an operator) or of earthmoving equipment without an operator shall be deemed rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property. For example:

(1) Rental of a backhoe, bulldozer, or similar earthmoving equipment with operator is construction contracting. Rental of these items without an operator is rental of tangible personal property.

(2) Rental of scaffolding, temporary fences, or barricades is rental of tangible personal property.

(3) Rental of pumps or cranes is rental of tangible personal property, regardless of whether or not an operator is included with the equipment rented.

(b) Distinction between equipment rental, leasing, or licensing for use and transporting for hire. The hiring of mobile equipment (cranes, airplanes, limousines, etc.) is considered rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property whenever the charge is for a fixed sum or hourly rate. By comparison, the activity of a common carrier conveying goods or persons for a fee based upon distance, and not time, shall be considered transporting for hire.

Reg. 3-450.2. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal property: membership fees; other charges.

(a) Membership, admission, or other fees charged by any rental club or limited access lessor are considered part of taxable gross income.

(b) Gross income from rental, leasing, or licensing for use of tangible personal property must include all charges by the lessor to the lessee for repair, maintenance, or other service upon the tangible personal property rented, leased, or licensed.

(c) Sale of a warranty, maintenance, or service contract as a requirement of, or in conjunction with, a rental, leasing, or licensing contract is exempt.

Reg. 3-450.3. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of equipment with operator.

In cases where the tangible personal property is rented, leased, or licensed with an operator provided by the lessor, the charge for the operator shall not be includable in the gross income from the rental, lease, or license of such tangible personal property if the charge for the operator and the charge for the use of the equipment are separately itemized to the lessee and separately maintained on the books and records of the lessor.

Reg. 3-450.4. Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal property: semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible personal property.

(a) The term “semi-permanently or permanently installed” means that the item of tangible personal property has and is expected to have at the time of installation a permanent location at the site installed, as under a long-term lease agreement, except that the person using or applying said property may eventually replace it because it has become worn out or has become obsolete or the person ceases to have the right to possession of said property.

(b) An item of tangible personal property is deemed permanently installed if its installation requires alterations to the premises.

(c) Examples of “semi-permanently or permanently installed tangible personal property” include, but are not limited to: computers, duplicating machines, furniture not of portable design, major appliances, store fixtures.

(d) The term does not include mobile transportation equipment or tangible personal property designed for regular use at different locations or customarily used at different locations, as under numerous short-term rental, lease, or license agreements, whether or not such property is in fact so used.

(1) For example, use of a mobile crane, trencher, automobile, or other similar equipment shall be considered a rental, lease, or license transaction subject to taxation only by the city or town in which such business office of the lessor is based.

(2) Other similar examples include, but are not limited to: camping equipment, contracting equipment, chain saw, forklift, household items, invalid needs, janitorial equipment, reducing equipment, furniture of portable design, trucks or trailers, tools, towbars, sump pumps, arc welders.

(e) A rental, lease, or license agreement which specifies that the item in question shall remain, under the terms of the agreement, located within the same city or town for more than one hundred eighty (10) consecutive days shall be sufficient evidence that such rented, leased, or licensed item is “permanently or semi-permanently installed” in said city or town, except when the item is mobile transportation equipment or one of the other types of portable equipment or property described in subsection (d) above.

Reg. 3-450.5 Rental, leasing, and licensing for use of tangible personal property: delivery, installation, repair, and maintenance charges.

(a) Delivery and installation charges in connection with the rental, leasing, and licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax imposed by STC 3.05.450; provided that the provisions of Regulation 3-100.2 have been met.

(b) Gross income from the sale of a warranty, maintenance, or similar service contract in connection with the rental, leasing, and licensing of tangible personal property shall be exempt.

(c) Separately stated charges for repair not included as part of a warranty, maintenance, or similar service contract relating to the rental, leasing, or licensing of tangible personal property are exempt from the tax imposed by STC 3.05.450; however, such income is subject to the provisions of STC 3.05.460 and 3.05.465, and the provisions of Regulation 3-465.1.

Reg. 3-455.1. Gratuities related to restaurant activity.

Gratuities charged by or collected by persons subject to the tax imposed by STC 3.05.455 may be excluded from gross income if:

(1) such charge is separately stated upon the bill, invoice, etc. provided the customer, and such amounts are maintained separately in the books and records of the taxpayer; and

(2) such gratuities are distributed in total to employees of the taxpayer in addition to customary and regular wages.

Reg. 3-460.1. Distinction between retail sales and certain other transfers of tangible personal property.

(a) Charges for transfer of tangible personal property included in the gross income of the business activity of persons engaged in the following business activities shall be deemed only as gross income from such business activity and not sales at retail taxed by STC 3.05.460:

(2) (Reserved).

(3) job printing, per STC 3.05.425.

(4) mining, timbering, and other extraction, but not sales of sand, gravel, or rock extracted from the ground, per STC 3.05.430.

(9) utility services, per STC 3.05.480.

(b) Distinction between construction contracting, retail, and certain direct customer service activities.

(1) When an item is attached or installed on real property, it is a construction contracting activity and any subsequent repair, removal, or replacement of that item is construction contracting.

(2) Items attached or installed on tangible personal property are retail sales.

(3) Transactions where no tangible personal property is attached or installed are considered direct customer service activities (for example: carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, landscape maintenance).

(4) Demolition, earth moving, and wrecking activities are considered construction contracting.

(c) The sale of sand, rock, and gravel extracted from the ground shall be deemed a sale of tangible personal property and not mining or metallurgical activity.

(d) Sale of consumable goods incorporated into or applied to real property is considered a retail sale and not construction contracting. Examples of consumable goods are lubricants, faucet washers, and air conditioning coolant, but not paint.

(e) Installation or removal of tangible personal property which has independent functional utility is considered a retail activity.

(1) “Tangible personal property which has independent functional utility” must be able to substantially perform its function(s) without attachment to real property. “Attachment to real property” must include more than connection to water, power, gas, communication, or other service.

(2) Examples of tangible personal property which has independent functional utility include artwork, furnishings, “plug-in” kitchen equipment, or similar items installed by bolts or similar fastenings.

(3) Examples of tangible personal property which does not have independent functional utility include wall-to-wall carpeting, flooring, wallpaper, kitchen cabinets, or “built-in” dishwashers or ranges.

(4) The installation of window coverings (drapes, mini-blinds, etc.) is always a retail activity.

Reg. 3-460.2. Retail sales: trading stamp company transactions.

A trading stamp transaction is defined as follows: the trading stamp company issues stamps to a vendor; the vendor then provides them to its customers; and the customer then exchanges the stamps for merchandise from the trading stamp company.

The exchange transaction for the merchandise shall be deemed a retail sale and the trading stamp company a retailer. All taxes imposed by this chapter applicable to retail transactions are therefore applicable to such exchange transactions.

The rate of tax shall be the retail rate based upon the retail dollar value of the redeemed merchandise as expressed in the redemption dollar value per book of stamps or portion thereof. The tax imposition described herein is in lieu of any Privilege or Use Tax upon the business of issuing stamps, redeeming the same, or using or storing property redeemed.

Reg. 3-460.3. Retail sales: membership fees of retailers.

Membership, admission, or other fees charged by limited access retailers are considered part of taxable gross income of the business activity of selling tangible personal property.

Reg. 3-460.4. Retail sales: professional services.

(a) “Professional Services” refer to services rendered by such persons as doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects, etc. for their customers or clients where the services meet particular needs of a specific client and only apply in the factual context of the client and the final product has no retail value in itself. For example, opinion letters, workpapers, reports, etc. are not in a form which would be subject to retail sales to customers. However, transfer of items in a form which would be subject to retail sales (e.g., artwork, forms, manuals, etc.) would not be considered professional services. The issue is one of fact which must be resolved in each situation.

(b) Creative (“idea”) labor and design labor that do not result in tangible personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed professional services and, if charged separately and maintained separately in the taxpayer’s books and records, are not includable in gross income.

(c) “Professional services” shall be deemed to include those items of tangible personal property which are incidental to the services rendered, provided such tangible personal property is “inconsequential.”

(1) Incidental transfers of tangible personal property shall be regarded as “inconsequential” if,

(A) the purchase price of the tangible personal property to the person rendering the professional services represents less than fifteen percent (15%) of the charge, billing, or statement rendered to the purchaser in connection with the transaction, and

(B) the tangible personal property transferred is not itself in a form which is subject to retail sale.

(2) In cases where the tangible personal property transferred is deemed inconsequential, the provider of the tangible personal property so transferred is deemed the ultimate consumer of such tangible personal property, and subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this chapter upon such transfer.

(d) Examples:

(1) The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of the services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is regarded as inconsequential to the charges for professional services.

(2) An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such appraiser’s efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential.

(3) Use of a hair care product on a client’s hair by a barber or beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually inconsequential. On the other hand, if the barber or beautician supplies the customer with a bottle of the product for the client’s use thereafter and without the professional’s assistance, the transfer of the bottle of hair care product is deemed not inconsequential.

(4) If a mortician properly segregates his professional services from other taxable activities on his bill (invoice, contract), his gross income would include only the income derived from the sale of tangible personal property (casket, cards, flowers, etc.) and rental, leasing, or licensing of real and tangible personal property. His charges for professional services (embalming, cosmetic work, etc.) would not be includable in gross income.

Reg. 3-460.5. Retail sales: monetized bullion; numismatic value of coins.

(a) “Monetized Bullion” means coins or other forms of money manufactured or minted from precious metals or other metals and issued as legal tender or a medium of exchange by or for any government authorized to do so.

(b) Any coin shall be considered to have been transferred or acquired primarily for its “Numismatic value” if the sale or acquisition price:

(1) is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) the value of the metallic content of the coin as of the date of transfer or acquisition; and

(2) is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) its face value, in the case of a coin which, at the time of transfer or acquisition, was legal tender or a medium of exchange of the government issuing or authorizing its issuance.

Reg. 3-460.6. Retail sales: consignment sales.

Sales of merchandise acquired on consignment are taxable as retail sales. In cases where the merchant is acting as an agent on behalf of another dealer, sales of the consigned merchandise are taxable to the principal, provided the merchant makes full disclosure to customers that he is acting only as an agent for the named principal. However, when the principal is not deemed to be a dealer, such sales are considered to be those of the merchant and are taxable to him.

Reg. 3-465.1. Retail sales: repair services.

(a) Fair market value of parts and labor charges. The tax collector may examine the reporting of all transactions covered by this section to determine if an “arms-length” price is charged for the parts and materials. The applicable tax may not be avoided by pricing a part, which ordinarily sells to the customer at $10, at $5 and including the difference as “service” or “labor”. In the absence of satisfactory evidence supplied by the taxpayer as to industry or business practice, the tax collector may use the cost of the part or materials to the taxpayer marked up by a reasonable profit, to estimate the gross income subject to tax.

(b) Notwithstanding Regulation 3‑350.1 (e),

(1) in the case where the taxpayer does not normally and regularly sell items of tangible personal property apart from a repair transaction, the taxpayer may determine the sale price of the tangible personal property transferred by means of a “computed charge”. The “computed charge” shall be the sum of the cost of the item of tangible personal property transferred, plus a “reasonable markup.” The “reasonable markup” shall be that amount needed to achieve a representative retail price for which such items of tangible personal property are normally sold at retail by comparable businesses within the State (not under circumstances involving the combination of such sale with the providing of repair services). The taxpayer shall have the initial responsibility of determining such reasonable markup, and providing to the tax collector, if requested, the basis for his determination.

Approval by the town shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Trees on private property may be trimmed only with the consent of the property owner.

L. At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit and upon sufficient notice, the licensee shall temporarily raise, lower or cut its wires as necessary to facilitate such move upon not less than 10 days’ advance written notice. The direct expense of such temporary changes, including standby time, shall be paid by the holder of the moving permit and the licensee may require payment in advance. [Ord. 2019-137 § 1; Ord. 2013-084 § 2, 2013.]


5.40.100 Service schedule.

Unless the license agreement provides otherwise, a licensee shall be required to extend its cable system pursuant to the following requirements:

A. Upon reasonable written request for service by any person located within the service area, the licensee shall, within 60 days, furnish the requested service to such person, unless prevented from providing said service due to factors outside licensee’s control such as permit restrictions or private easement considerations. If such service has not been implemented within 90 days of written notice from the town, the town may impose liquidated damages for each day thereafter in accordance with this chapter.

B. When requested by a resident or developer in the town, the licensee shall, at licensee’s sole expense, extend the cable system to any single-family residence or dwelling within the town; provided, that such extension involves density of 35 existing homes per cable plant mile measured from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system, determined by licensee in its sole discretion. Upon request, this density requirement may be modified by the town for a particular location, provided licensee demonstrates that it would be commercially impracticable to comply with said requirement. For purposes of this section, a density requirement may be considered commercially impracticable if licensee’s compliance with said requirement would create a significant adverse impact on the capital costs of licensee’s cable system.

C. Given reasonable notice by the town or the builder of a residential development and cooperation by the utilities, licensee shall prevent unnecessary damage to streets, rights-of-way and property by installing underground cable or conduit in all new subdivisions of six or more dwelling units within the service area at the same time and in the same trench as telephone, electric or similar services are installed. Cable need not be installed and/or activated until the new subdivision meets the criteria established for line extensions.

D. The licensee shall extend and make cable television service available to any resident requesting connection within the licensee’s authorized service area and within an area that meets or exceeds the minimum subscriber density at the standard connection charge if the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a 125-foot aerial or underground drop line.

E. With respect to requests for connection requiring an aerial or underground drop line in excess of 125 feet, the licensee shall extend service to such residents within the licensee’s authorized service area and within an area that meets or exceeds the minimum subscriber density at a one-time charge not to exceed the actual installation costs incurred by the licensee for the distance exceeding 125 feet. [Ord. 2019-137 § 1; Ord. 2013-084 § 2, 2013.] 


5.40.110 Removal of licensee property.

A. In the event that licensee property has been installed in a street or other dedicated public right-of-way without complying with the requirements of this chapter, or the license has been terminated, revoked or expired, or the use of any licensee property is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, the licensee shall, at its sole expense, on the demand of the town, remove within 120 days from the street all licensee property other than that which the town may permit to be abandoned in place.

B. Upon such removal of licensee property, the licensee shall promptly restore the street or other public places from which the licensee property was removed to a condition as near as possible to its prior condition.

C. Licensee property no longer in service may be left in place with the approval of and in a manner prescribed by the town.

D. Upon abandonment of licensee property in place, the licensee shall deliver to the town an instrument transferring ownership of such abandoned licensee property to the town.

E. Any cost arising from compliance with this provision shall be borne by the licensee. [Ord. 2019-137 § 1; Ord. 2013-084 § 2, 2013.]


5.40.120 Local office, records to be maintained.

A. Licensee shall maintain a business office accessible during all normal business hours for the purpose of receiving inquiries regarding new service, handling converters, paying bills and receiving complaints. In the alternative, licensee shall have a listed telephone number and operator to receive such inquiries and complaints and employ a sufficient number of telephone lines to allow reasonable access by subscribers and members of the public.

B. Licensee shall establish and maintain a written log listing all subscriber complaints. The written log shall include the name and telephone number, if given, of the subscriber making the complaint and licensee’s action on the complaint. The log shall be maintained by licensee for three years and, to the extent permitted by federal law, shall be available to the town manager and the public for inspection upon request during licensee’s normal business hours. [Ord. 2019-137 § 1; Ord. 2013-084 § 2, 2013.]


5.40.130 Service provisions.

A. The licensee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible; the licensee shall be able to demonstrate by instruments and otherwise to subscribers that a signal of adequate strength and quality is being delivered to the subscriber’s terminal.

B. The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all licenses. The town may require that a licensee exceed these minimum requirements:

1. The channel capacity of the cable system shall be expandable as future needs arise. At a minimum, system capacity of 750 MHz must be available for signal transmission on the cable system.

2. A cable system shall provide leased access channels as required by federal law.

3. Standard installation and basic service to town buildings may be required without charge as set forth in the license agreement.

4. In accordance with the provisions of FCC rules and regulations, as they may from time to time be amended, licensee shall install and maintain an emergency alert system and shall transmit all emergency act notifications and emergency act terminations relating to local and statewide situations as may be designated to be an emergency by the local primary, the state primary and/or the state emergency operations center, as those authorities are identified and defined with the FCC rules and regulations, Part 11.

5. A licensee shall provide standby power for the head end so as to be able to operate some channels during a power outage for a minimum of six hours.

C. A licensee shall have available at all times personnel, equipment and procedures capable of locating and correcting major system malfunctions.

D. Each cable system shall be operated in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and equal accessibility of facilities, equipment, channels, studios and other services to all residences, businesses, public agencies or other entities having a legitimate use of the system, and no one shall be arbitrarily excluded from its use. A licensee shall not discriminate in terms of rates, terms of service, or extension of service on the basis of age, race, creed, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, nor shall a licensee fail to extend service to any part of the town within its licensed service area on the basis of the income of the residents.

E. A licensee shall establish procedures for the investigation and resolution of all complaints, including, but not limited to, those regarding the quality of service and equipment malfunction. A copy of such procedures shall be provided to the town upon request and to all subscribers upon installation of initial service. 

F. A licensee shall provide each subscriber, at the time cable service is installed, written instruction for placing a service call, filing a complaint, or requesting an adjustment. The name, address, and telephone number of the town office responsible for supervision of cable operations shall be listed. Each subscriber shall also be provided with a schedule of the subscriber’s rates and charges, a copy of the service contract, delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect procedures, and a description of any other of the licensee’s applicable policies in connection with its subscribers.

G. A licensee may interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time reasonably possible and, except in emergency situations, only after prior notice to subscribers and the town of the anticipated service interruption; provided, however, no prior subscriber or town notice shall be required for the performance of system maintenance work requiring a maximum of one-hour duration during the hours of 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 midnight or four hours’ duration during the hours of 12:00 midnight until 6:00 a.m.

H. Upon termination of service to a subscriber and at the subscriber’s request, a licensee shall promptly remove all its facilities and equipment from the subscriber’s premises. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable or internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed.

I. The town may waive any requirement of this section for licenses where the applicant demonstrates that such waiver is in the public interest. [Ord. 2019-137 § 1; Ord. 2013-084 § 2, 2013.]

a. Water Supplied by Municipal Corporation, Special Taxing District, or Private Water Company. For purposes of determining connection fees, applicant shall provide one of the following to the department for connection fee calculation and payment prior to issuance of a building permit:

i. Water provider receipt showing size of purchased water meter;

ii. Water provider receipt for meter security deposits showing meter size; or

iii. Approved plumbing plan or water plan indicating the architect or engineer’s required water meter size. 

b. Supplied by Private Wells. No connection to the public sewerage system will be allowed except through an approved sewer service agreement with the town.

B. Modification, Demolition or Replacement of Structures. No additional connection fees are due for a physical change to the plumbing system or plumbing fixtures of a structure or structures on a property that is connected to the public sanitary sewerage system, provided the water meter size does not increase; or provided, that there is not a change in property use. In the event that a change in service is proposed and that change will result in an increase in water meter size or result in a shift in the structure use from residential to commercial/industrial, applicant shall submit an application to the department explaining the proposed change. Applicant will pay the difference in connection fees between the two meter sizes at the time of application. The department may disapprove the application if the proposed change may result in downstream treatment or conveyance capacity exceedances. The department shall disapprove the application if applicant has not paid the difference in connection fees due between the new use or water meter size and the old. If the structure has a commercial or industrial use, the applicant may be required to obtain a new industrial wastewater control permit prior to receiving final occupancy permit. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2012-071 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2010-35 § 2; Ord. 2008-10 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2008-05 §§ 6, 7; Ord. 2007-14 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2005-15 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2004-15 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2003-03 §§ 1, 2; Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-2.]


13.10.025 Connection fees.

A. Connection Fee Rates. Except as otherwise provided in this section, persons connecting to the public sanitary sewer system shall pay the following connection fee: 

1. Residential:

	Water Meter Size	Amount

	5/8", 3/4", or 1"	$4,933

2. Commercial/Industrial/Multifamily:

	Water Meter Size	Amount

	5/8" or 3/4"	$4,933

	1"	$10,288

	1 1/2"	$32,794

	2"	$84,671

	3"	$197,162

	4"	$441,240

Connection fees for commercial/industrial discharges with water meters greater than four inches in size will be calculated on a case-by-case basis using the following formula where “C” represents the cost of capacity factor of $21.33 per gallon to convey and treat wastewater, “G” represents the estimated number of gallons of wastewater produced during a peak flow day, and “I” represents a system inflow and infiltration rate factor of 1.175.

Connection fee in dollars = C x G x I

The connection fee may be adjusted higher or lower, through a sewer service agreement, for any particular connection or development, based upon contributions to treatment infrastructure, oversizing, expedited construction of infrastructure, or other reasons that benefit the parties. In the event such sewer service agreement exists, the rates and provisions set forth in such sewer service agreement shall supersede and replace the provisions of this section.

B. Connection Fee Discount. The connection fee discount is determined by either of the following:

1. The connection fee discount is determined by an approved sewer service agreement.

2. The construction of a qualifying public sewer improvement shall, as provided in this subsection, qualify the developer for a discount against the connection fee otherwise due per dwelling unit or per commercial/industrial/multifamily facility. Except as provided for in subsection D of this section, the amount of the discount from each such eligible connection fee shall be $1,100 for the construction of a qualifying public sewer collection or conveyance improvement and $250.00 for the construction of a qualifying public sewer treatment improvement. For residential projects, one dwelling unit shall be granted connection fee discount status for each 25 feet qualifying public sanitary sewer line installed by the developer.

Once the aggregate connection fee discounts received for an area under development exceed the net construction cost of the qualifying public sewer conveyance improvement constructed by a developer of the area under development, no further connections within the area under development shall receive connection fee discounts based on the construction of that qualifying sewer improvement. Notice of this event need not be provided to the developer. For purposes of this subsection B, net construction costs shall mean the difference between the actual construction cost paid by a developer and any credits granted for the construction pursuant to STC 13.10.030.

C. Qualifying Public Sewer Improvements.

1. Except as otherwise identified by an approved sewer service agreement, only dwellings and commercial/industrial facilities directly tributary to the qualifying public sewer improvements listed in this subsection that are being or have been constructed by the applicant or a previous developer of the property shall qualify for the connection fee discount. The connection fee discount status shall run with the property and may not be transferred to another property.

2. Property for which connection fee discount status is requested shall be clearly identified on the tentative plat, development plan and/or public sanitary sewage conveyance system facility construction plans when they are presented for review. The eligibility for a connection fee discount shall be confirmed in writing by the director or the director’s designee. The connection fee discount may apply to:

a. A portion, or portions, of the development (including portions of individual buildings); or

b. Structures tributary to a segment of sewer; or

c. An individual sewage drainage basin within the overall development; or

d. The entire development.

3. The qualifying sanitary sewer shall have a minimum length of 25 feet as measured from the point of connection to the existing public sewerage system to the closest edge of the area under development for any dwelling units or commercial/industrial projects to be granted the connection fee discount. For the purpose of computing sewer length for connection fee discount status, the length of the qualifying sewer over 25 feet in length may be rounded to the next appropriate multiple of 25.

4. The types of public sewerage system improvements installed by the applicant or any previous developer that may qualify a property for the connection fee discount status are as follows:

a. Off-site, down-gradient gravity flow sanitary sewers that serve other properties in addition to the area under development; or

b. A new fully accessible, public gravity flow sanitary sewer that replaces an existing inaccessible public sanitary sewer when the replacement is requested by the department and the sewer’s inaccessibility is not the result of applicant’s or any previous developer or property owner’s activities; or

c. Augmentation of an existing down-gradient, gravity flow public sanitary sewer of a size that provides sufficient capacity to serve the area under development. The augmentation sewer may also qualify for a credit or rebate pursuant to STC 13.10.030 if the augmentation is of a pipe size larger than that needed to serve the area under development.

d. Improvement in treatment capacity at the publicly owned treatment works serving the area under development or a portion of the area under development. The portion of the development qualifying for connection fee discount status shall be based on the design flows projected to be received from the area under development in relation to the amount of treatment capacity expansion provided.

5. The types of public sanitary sewers installed by the applicant or any previous developer that shall not qualify a property for the connection fee discount status are as follows:

a. Off-site public gravity sewer lines installed by the developer which cannot be used by any properties down gradient from the property under development; or

b. Off-site and on-site public sewers that do not serve the area under development that provide flow-through from up-gradient properties; or

c. A public sanitary sewage pumping station and off-site force main.

6. For projects in which only a portion of the project is eligible for the connection fee discount, the connection fee discount status shall be given to the most down-gradient dwelling units of the proposed development which are directly tributary to the qualifying public sanitary sewer.

D. Special Facilities. If the property necessitates the construction of special facilities, and the department approves the construction of special facilities, the applicant shall provide these special facilities at its own expense. The cost to the applicant to provide any special facilities shall be in addition to connection fees established for the property, and the cost to operate the special facilities may be subject to special operating fees.

E. Prevailing Rate. The connection fee charged shall be calculated using the rate prevailing at the time of payment. The connection right shall continue for the life of the structure, for the use originally permitted. If a conversion or change of use occurs which results in a change in meter size or a shift in use from residential to commercial/industrial, the difference in connection fees is due and immediately payable upon conversion or change of use. Conversions shall be reviewed for compliance with industrial waste ordinance requirements. 

F. Prepaid Connection Fees. Prepaid connection fees shall be deducted from the prevailing rate fee calculation.

G. Connection Fee Surcharge. The town council may, by resolution, institute a connection fee surcharge for a specific area to recover the costs of required facilities in that area.

H. Temporary Connections. The director may authorize, in writing, issuance of a permit for a unit to be temporarily connected to a nearby sewer. All permits issued and installations made pursuant to this section shall be on a temporary basis only, and shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

An applicant for sewer service for a period not to exceed two years may be issued a temporary permit. The permit may not be renewed. The prevailing connection fee rate shall be charged the applicant for this permit. The connection fees paid may be credited against the sewer connection fees for a permanent connection replacing the temporary connection within the two-year period. If a permanent connection is not achieved within the two-year time period, the temporary connection permit shall expire, the physical connection shall be eliminated, and the connection fees shall not be returned.

I. Payment of Connection Fees.

1. The connection fee payment is due at the time of issuance of a plumbing or building permit. Fees shall be first applied to any unpaid fees owed by the applicant to the department. The total fees due may be rounded to the nearest dollar.

2. If no building or plumbing permit is issued, the connection fee is due prior to physically connecting or being able to discharge to the system.

3. Interest charges shall be added to any unpaid connection fee and calculated at the rate of 10 percent per year on the unpaid connection fee balance compounded daily. If the unpaid connection fee and any interest charges are not paid by the property owner within 10 working days from the date of a notice of delinquency, the director may add to the amount due any legal or collection costs incurred.

J. Connection Fee Refunds. Upon application to the department, a connection fee may be refunded if the physical connection for which the fee was paid has not been made. Connection fee refunds shall not be processed for payment for 60 days following receipt of the application for the refund to give the department the opportunity to verify the facts associated with the original connection fee application and the refund application. An administrative fee of $125.00 shall be assessed for each connection fee refund authorized. The director shall have the authority to waive the payment of an administrative fee or to direct early payment of a connection fee refund in situations involving a structural addition to or the remodeling of an existing, owner-occupied single-family residence where, for reasons beyond the owner’s control, the owner is not able to construct the addition to or start the remodeling of the residence. 

K. Physical Connections. An applicant for public sewer service shall not make physical connection to the public sanitary sewerage system without prior written authorization of the town. Written authorization includes both the connection permit issued upon payment of connection fees (or an approved connection fee payment plan in accordance with subsection L of this section) and notification to the applicant by the town that the town has received approval from Arizona Department of Environmental Quality to place the public sanitary sewer in service. An applicant who makes, or causes to be made, a physical connection to the public sanitary sewerage system without first obtaining written authorization from the town shall pay investigation and administration fees of $2,500, plus any additional costs to the department up to $5,000, in addition to the standard plan services and connection fees required by this chapter. 

L. Connection Fee Payment Plan. As an alternative to payment in full of connection fees prior to the issuance of a building permit, applicant may enter into a connection fee payment agreement with the town at the discretion of the director.

M. Determination of House Connection Sewer Stub-Out Location. After a property owner has applied and exhausted all means and methods to locate a building connection sewer by excavation techniques, then upon application to the department and upon payment of a nonrefundable $250.00 stub-out locating fee, the department shall apply closed circuit television techniques to determine the location of all house connection sewer stub-outs that might exist at the main line of the public sanitary sewage conveyance facility that could serve the property identified on the application. Should the application identify multiple adjacent and contiguous properties for which more than one house connection sewer stub-out is sought, the nonrefundable stub-out locating fee shall be increased by $50.00 for each additional property over the first property to be served. Identification of the property to be served shall be by legal description (i.e., lot and block) and by street address for each property. If one or more stub-outs are located that would serve the property, the department shall mark the ground surface location of all stub-outs using marking paint, or some other appropriate means, and shall notify the applicant by first-class mail of the locations that were found. Neither the owners of the involved properties nor their contractors shall access the public sanitary sewage conveyance system for the purpose of determining the locations of house connection sewer stub-outs. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2017-122 § 1; Ord. 2014-089 § 2; Ord. 2012-071 §§ 1, 2.] 


13.10.030 Connection credits and rebates.

A. Credits. The town may enter into a credit agreement with an applicant for sewer service for the additional construction costs incurred for the installation of either a public sanitary sewer facility of a size larger than would be required to collect or treat the waste from the area under development, or a facility in addition to the system required to serve the area under development. The department shall determine the base sewerage facility size for the area under development and the additional required sewerage facility size. The credits shall be applied as an offset to connection fees to be paid by the applicant. The credits shall not be in the form of a cash refund or rebate. The credits shall be usable for 10 years from the execution of the agreement by the town council. The council may designate a longer usable life for the credits for good cause. The agreement shall specify either that the credits are granted to the applicant for use on any property owned by the applicant within town, except as otherwise specified or limited in the credit agreement, or that the credits are usable only within the area under development and are assignable to future owners. The credits awarded for such over-sizing shall not exceed the total connection fees to be collected from the area under development as set forth in STC 13.10.025.

B. Rebates. In the event an applicant installs a public sanitary sewer system which provides at least 51 percent residual capacity for property other than the area under development, an agreement for refund of the cost of the residual capacity may be made with the applicant. The refund shall be made until the full sum has been paid, or for a maximum of 10 years from the date of the refund agreement, whichever shall first occur. In the event the full sum due the applicant has not been refunded within the 10-year period, any balance remaining shall be considered canceled and the town shall be fully discharged from any further obligation under the agreement. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-3.] 


13.10.040 Activation fees and deposits.

An activation fee of $10.00 per event shall be levied and collected for activation of new wastewater service, reactivation of wastewater service, or the transfer of service from one customer to another. In addition, the billing manager may require an advance deposit of not less than two months, nor more than 12 months, of the estimated user fees from any of the above activations. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A).]


13.10.050 Monthly sewer fees.

A. A monthly fee shall be levied and collected from all users connected to the wastewater system. Each user fee shall be a combination of the following fees.

1. Base Service Fee. A base service fee shall be levied upon each user account to recover a portion of the fixed system costs and costs not proportional to flow. The base service fee shall be based simply upon connection to the system, and not use of the system, in order to compensate for the availability of service. The full monthly base service fee shall be charged to all users who are connected to the system for any portion of a month, and shall not be subject to proration for partial months.

a. Effective January 1, 2018: $16.60.

b. Effective January 1, 2019: $18.97.

2. User Consumption Fee. In addition to the base service fee, a user consumption fee shall be levied upon each user account, in proportion to water consumption or wastewater discharge, to recover costs of treatment and reclamation. The user consumption fee shall be calculated by multiplying (a) the monthly wastewater flow (set forth in STC 13.10.060), (b) the high strength factor (set forth in STC 13.10.070), and (c) the user consumption fee rate listed below.

a. User consumption fee effective January 1, 2018 shall be $8.12.

b. User consumption fee effective January 1, 2019 shall be $8.39.

3. Irrigation Credit. The user consumption fee shall be reduced 20 percent, in order to account for water that is used for irrigation and other purposes that do not discharge water into the sanitary sewerage system. This irrigation credit is to be applied to all users irrespective of the amount of water each user discharges into the sanitary sewerage system.

4. Paperless Billing Credit. For each month a user uses the town’s paperless billing system, that user shall receive a credit of $1.00.

5. Toxic Waste Fee. In addition to any user fees established by this chapter, a user who is detected discharging any toxic wastes into the sanitary sewerage system in violation of this chapter shall be subject to the increased cost of the treatment of the prohibited substance. This provision shall not preclude the director from pursuing the additional penalties provided in Chapter 13.25 STC.

6. Adjustments Related to Measurement. Where data on flow volume, chemical oxygen demand or suspended solids are reported to the town by the user and form the basis for that user’s fee, such data shall be subject to town verification. If subsequent measurements or other investigations reveal that such user is discharging a volume of flow, chemical oxygen demand or suspended solids significantly in excess of that reported to the town, the billing manager may assess such user according to the data obtained by the town retroactive to the time of the user’s latest report, together with any applicable delinquent charges, penalties, and interest as provided in STC 13.10.120. Prior to revising a sewer user fee pursuant to this subsection, the town shall obtain at least two 24-hour samples and flow measurements.

7. Failure to Report Fee. A commercial or industrial user that fails to provide the required discharge quantity information shall pay, in addition to the average monthly user fee calculated from the last available six months of monthly discharge reports provided by the user, an administrative fee equal to 25 percent of the average monthly user fee.

8. Department inspectors shall have access at all reasonable times to metering devices on private sanitary sewage conveyance systems or on private wells. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A).]


13.10.060 Calculation of monthly wastewater flow.

A. For users with metered water but no additional metering, the monthly wastewater flow shall be 100 percent of the monthly water consumption reflected by the meter, measured in thousands of gallons, irrespective of the use of the water.

B. For users who have separate meters installed by a water company to measure water returned to the public sanitary sewerage system and/or water not returned to the public sanitary sewerage system, the monthly wastewater flow shall be 100 percent of the meter which measures the water returned to the public sanitary sewerage system, measured in thousands of gallons. Such users shall not receive the irrigation credit.

C. For users without metered water or wastewater, the billing manager shall determine the method of calculating the monthly wastewater flow. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A).]


13.10.070 High strength factors.

The high strength factors below shall be used to calculate the user consumption fee as provided in STC 13.10.050(A)(2).

	User Class	Class Name	High-Strength Factor

	1	Residential/All other customer classes	1

	3C	Auto body and fender	2.1

[Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A).]


13.10.080 Sub-billings.

Users, such as landlords, that issue sanitary sewer sub-billings that refer to a town sanitary sewer user fee shall state the town sanitary sewer user fee as a separate item on all billings. In a sub-billing, no user shall refer to a sanitary sewer user fee assessed by town, except in a fashion truly reflecting the actual amount assessed by town. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-13. Formerly 13.10.130.]


13.10.090 Service discontinuance.

Any user wishing to discontinue the use of the town wastewater system must give notice of discontinuance to the water company supplying water to such user, and must discontinue water service at the same time. Any user who is supplied water by a private well wishing to discontinue the use of the town wastewater system must give notice of discontinuance to the town wastewater management department, and must discontinue receiving water from that private well. The fees set forth in this code shall continue to be levied, and shall be due and owing, until such notice has been given. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-16. Formerly 13.10.160.]


13.10.100 Payment.

User fees are due and payable at the office of the billing manager not later than 20 days after the billing date on the bill (the “due date”). The billing manager shall have the authority to create standard and customized payment plans. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-17. Formerly 13.10.170.]


13.10.110 Protest and review.

A. Within 90 days after the billing date, a user may submit a protest to the billing manager. Such protest shall be in writing, and shall include all itemized objections to the fee(s) charged. The user shall have the burden of showing that any or all of the computations were erroneous or misapplied.

B. The billing manager shall review the protest and determine the outcome of the protest. If the billing manager decides in favor of the user, any overpayment will be reimbursed to the user, but in no event will any reimbursement relate to payments made more than 90 days prior to the date of the protest. If the billing manager decides against the user, the user shall pay all amounts due within 30 days. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A).]


13.10.120 Delinquency and penalties.

A. Delinquency Date. Unpaid user account balances are delinquent after the due date.

B. Late Penalty Fee. Delinquent user fees shall be assessed an additional late penalty fee of $10.00 each month a delinquency remains unpaid. This fee shall be subject to interest charges as provided below.

C. Interest. Upon a date that user account balances become delinquent, such delinquent balances shall accrue interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum until paid in full.

D. Collection Penalty Fee and Costs of Collection. Accounts that are grossly past due may require additional efforts to collect. Accounts requiring these additional collection efforts shall be assessed a collection penalty fee of 10 percent of the outstanding account balance due at the time additional collection efforts are undertaken. Additionally, a user shall be responsible for all specifically identifiable costs associated with collection, including but not limited to collection agency fees, court fees, process service fees, mailing fees, attorneys’ fees, and recording fees. These costs shall be subject to interest charges, as provided above. 

E. Property Lien. Pursuant to ARS 9-511.02, the town may file a lien on property for the nonpayment of sewerage system user fees if the payment of the fees is delinquent for more than 90 days. The unpaid fees, from the date of recording in the office of the county recorder, are a lien on the property until the fees are paid.

F. Disconnection of Service. In the event any sum is delinquent, the town may discontinue service by interrupting the flow into the sewerage system. In such event, upon reconnection to the sewerage system, the user shall be responsible for the cost of disconnection, as well as the cost of reconnection. [Ord. 2017-126 § 2 (Exh. A); Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-2-19. Formerly 13.10.190.]

This is accomplished in compliance with a publicly owned treatment works (“POTW”) pretreatment program mandated by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to the SWTRF in conformity with 40 C.F.R. Part 403 and the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq., as amended. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-1.]


13.20.020 Applicability.

This chapter applies to all industrial users discharging to the SWTRF. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-2.]


13.20.030 General prohibitions.

A. Unless otherwise permitted by permit, no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any sewer, which directly or indirectly connects to the SWTRF, any industrial waste which may have an adverse or harmful effect on the SWTRF, SWTRF personnel or equipment, SWTRF effluent quality, public or private property; which may otherwise endanger the public, the environment or create a public nuisance; which exceeds limitations as set by this chapter or the town; or cause the SWTRF to violate state or federal regulations or permits. Prohibited industrial waste described in this chapter shall not be discharged to the SWTRF. Included within this prohibition is the discharge of any industrial wastes that adversely affect water reclamation, water reuse, sludge disposal or air quality.

B. In determining the acceptability of specific industrial waste, the town shall consider the nature of the industrial waste and the adequacy and nature of the collection, treatment, and disposal system available to accept the industrial waste.

C. The town may establish discharge limits for industrial users which have or may have a reasonable potential to degrade the industrial wastewater quality such that it prevents or inhibits the SWTRF’s efforts to reclaim the water, to dispose of sludge, or causes any unusual operation or maintenance problems at the SWTRF. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-3.]


13.20.040 Prohibited industrial waste.

Except as provided elsewhere in this chapter, prohibited industrial waste shall include:

A. Industrial wastewater that may be adverse or harmful to the SWTRF, its personnel, equipment, or effluent quality, including, but not limited to:

1. Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, solvent, fuel oil or any other liquids, solids, or gases which create or tend to create a fire or explosion hazard in the SWTRF, or to be injurious in any other way to the SWTRF, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Any solids or viscous substances of such size or in such quantities that they may obstruct the flow in the sewer or be detrimental to SWTRF operations, including, but not limited to, asphalt, dead animals, ashes, sand, mud, straw, industrial process shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, grass clippings, tar, plastic resins, wood, blood, paunch manure, grease, bones, hair, fleshings, entrails, paper cups, paper dishes, milk cartons or other similar paper products, either whole or ground.

3. Any amounts of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products originating from mineral oil in amounts that would cause or tend to cause interference or pass-through.

4. Any biodegradable oils, fats and greases, such as lard, tallow or vegetable oil, in concentrations that may cause adverse effects on the SWTRF.

5. Any industrial waste containing a concentration in excess of the discharge limits specified in STC 13.20.050 or in any permit for the following parameters: arsenic, barium, boron, cadmium, chlorine, chromium, copper, cyanide, lead, manganese, mercury, oil and grease, nickel, phenol (total), selenium, silver, sulfides, or zinc.

6. Any industrial waste in such concentration or volume that is toxic to humans, animals, the local environment or to biological industrial wastewater treatment processes; or that causes interference, upset or pass-through at the SWTRF.

7. Any industrial waste having a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 9.0 standard units; causing incrustations, scale or precipitates on sewer walls; or having any corrosive or detrimental characteristics that may cause injury to the SWTRF or service and maintenance personnel.

a. Where an industrial user is required by its permit to continuously monitor its pH discharge over a 30-day period, the industrial user shall maintain the pH of such industrial wastewater within the range set forth in its permit, except that variations from the range are permitted subject to the following limitations:

(1) The total time during which the pH values are outside the required range of pH values shall not exceed seven hours and 26 minutes in any calendar month; and

(2) No individual variations from the range of pH values shall exceed 60 minutes nor shall the pH be less than 5.0.

b. Where an industrial user is required by its permit to continuously monitor its pH discharge on any representative day, the industrial user shall maintain the pH of such industrial wastewater within the range set forth in its permit, except that variations from the range are permitted subject to the following limitations:

(1) The total time during which the pH values are outside the required range of pH values shall not exceed 10 percent of the duration of discharge; and

(2) No individual variations from the range of pH values shall exceed 45 minutes, nor shall the pH be less than 5.0.

c. For purposes of this section, a “variation” is the period of time or volume of discharge, from when the range is exceeded until the discharge has returned to compliance.

8. Any industrial waste having a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or higher at the discharge point, or which causes the SWTRF influent to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

9. Any excessive amounts of chlorinated hydrocarbon or organic phosphorous type compounds.

Permits and renewal permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-12.]


13.20.130 Standard permit conditions.

Each of the following conditions shall be a part of every permit issued pursuant to this chapter, whether expressly stated in the permit or not.

A. State and Federal Requirements. An industrial user shall comply with all applicable federal rules, regulations or pretreatment standards, or any applicable more stringent state or local rules, regulations or standards whether or not contained in the permit.

B. Separation of Wastes. All domestic source industrial wastewater from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains, and similar sources shall be kept separate from all other industrial wastewater until the industrial wastewater has passed through any required pretreatment facility or device and the industrial wastewater monitoring facility. The town may waive this condition if subsection F of this section is utilized.

C. Sample Location. As a condition of the permit, all discharged industrial wastewater shall pass through a designated sampling location. This sample location shall be located so as to allow unrestricted physical access by the town or its designated agent.

D. Accidental Discharge Protection (Slug Discharges). All industrial users shall provide protection from the accidental discharge or spill into the SWTRF of prohibited, hazardous or other industrial waste materials which are regulated through this chapter. Such protection shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user’s expense. No industrial user shall commence discharge to the SWTRF without accidental discharge protection facilities or procedures.

E. Posting of Bond. The town may at any time impose the posting of a bond by any industrial user, including, but not limited to, any septage hauler. In determining the amount of any bond which is to be required, the town shall consider: (1) the reasonably foreseeable injury to SWTRF facilities or personnel that could result from any discharge in violation of the requirements of this chapter; (2) the nature and extent of any previous violation by the industrial user of applicable federal, state, or local discharge requirements; and (3) the extent to which the industrial user is reasonably deemed liable for any existing damages to the SWTRF.

F. Combined Wastewater Formula. The following combined industrial wastewater formula shall be used by industrial users that mix regulated industrial wastewater with other regulated or unregulated industrial wastewater prior to pretreatment.

The alternative discharge limits shall be derived using the following formula:


[IMAGE]


where

CT = the alternative concentration limit for the combined wastestream.

Ci = the categorical pretreatment standard concentration limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream i.

Fi = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) of stream i to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.

FD = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) from boiler blowdown streams, noncontact cooling streams, sanitary wastestreams, and demineralizer backwash streams where such streams are not regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard.

FT = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) through the combined treatment facility (includes Fi and FD).

N = the total number of regulated streams.

An alternative discharge limit may not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants. As a result, the combined industrial wastewater formula cannot be used, and industrial wastestreams must be segregated.

G. Duty to Reapply. An industrial user shall submit a new application with appropriate fees 180 days before the existing permit expires.

H. Duty to Comply. An industrial user must comply with all conditions of the permit. Any noncompliance with the permit constitutes a violation of this chapter and may be subject to enforcement as provided for in Chapter 13.25 STC. An industrial user shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under Section 307(a) of the CWA for toxic pollutants within the time period provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions.

I. Need to Halt or Reduce Activity Not a Defense. It shall not be a defense for an industrial user in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of the permit.

J. Duty to Mitigate. An industrial user shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge in violation of the permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment.

K. Proper Operation and Maintenance. An industrial user shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the industrial user to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. An industrial user shall operate backup or auxiliary facilities or similar systems as necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit.

L. Duty to Provide Information. An industrial user shall furnish to the town, within 30 days, any information which the town may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking, or reissuing the permit, or to determine compliance with the permit. An industrial user shall also furnish to the town, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by the permit.

M. Compliance Schedule. The town shall require the development of a compliance schedule by industrial users for the installation of technology required to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The town shall revise the compliance schedule in the event the categorical pretreatment standards are revised to include new requirements applicable to an industrial user.

N. Signatory Requirement. All applications, reports, or information submitted to the director shall be signed and certified.

O. Removed Substances. Regulated industrial waste or other pollutants removed in the course of treatment or control of industrial wastewater shall be properly disposed of in a manner such as to prevent any pollutant from such materials from entering the SWTRF.

P. Severability. The provisions of the permit are severable, and if any provision of the permit, or the application of any provision of the permit to any circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and remainder of the permit, shall not be affected thereby.

Q. Civil and Criminal Liability. Except as provided in permit conditions on by-pass and upset, nothing in the permit shall be construed to relieve an industrial user from civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance.

R. Permit Actions. The permit may be modified, suspended, or revoked for cause. The filing of a request by an industrial user for a permit modification, reissuance, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not waive or suspend any permit condition.

S. Property Rights. The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.

T. Comment Period. The permit holder has 33 days from the date of the mailing of the permit in which to make comment in writing to the town. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-13.]


13.20.140 Inspection and entry.

3. Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the town in the permit.

4. A significant industrial user shall submit to the town a periodic compliance report no less frequently than four times per year.

E. Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements contained in any compliance schedule of the permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each scheduled date.

F. Collection, preservation, and analysis of samples must be conducted according to test procedures approved under 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless other test procedures have been specified in the permit.

G. All samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory licensed under ARS 36-495.01.

H. All reports and information submitted to the town shall be signed and certified.

I. Except for data determined to be confidential under 40 C.F.R. Part 2, all records prepared in accordance with the terms of the permit shall be available for public inspection at the administrative offices of the town, upon request to and approval by the town. Permit applications, permits, and effluent data shall not be considered confidential.

J. An industrial user designated a “significant industrial user” and having no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the SWTRF’s operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement may petition the town for removal of that designation. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-15.]


13.20.160 Notification requirements.

A. In the event of any by-pass, upset, accidental discharge, spill, or slug load that may endanger health, the environment, or the SWTRF, an industrial user shall notify the town by telephone within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the circumstances in which any such event exceeds or violates any limitation in the permit or this chapter. The notification shall include location of the event, type of waste, concentration and volume, and proposed corrective actions.

B. Within five days following notification to the town, an industrial user shall submit to the town a detailed written report containing such information and describing the cause of the event and measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve an industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the SWTRF or any other person or property; nor shall such notification relieve an industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.

C. An industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis within 10 days of becoming aware of such violation and submit the results of the repeat sampling and analysis to the town within 30 days.

13.20.170 By-pass.

A. By-Pass Not Exceeding Limitations. An industrial user may allow any by-pass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These by-passes are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this section.

B. Notice.

1. Anticipated By-Pass. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a by-pass, it shall submit prior notice, at least 10 days before the date of the by-pass.

2. Unanticipated By-Pass. An industrial user shall submit notice of an unanticipated by-pass as required in STC 13.20.160.

C. Prohibition of By-Pass. By-pass is prohibited, and the director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for by-pass, unless all of the following conditions apply:

1. By-pass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage.

2. There were no feasible alternatives to the by-pass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a by-pass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.

3. The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection B of this section.

D. The director may approve an anticipated by-pass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in subsection C of this section. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-17.]


13.20.180 Upset.

An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for permit noncompliance if an industrial user can demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:

A. An upset occurred and that the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

B. The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;

C. The industrial user submitted notice of the upset as required in STC 13.20.160; and

D. The industrial user complied with any remedial measures required under STC 13.20.130(J).

In any enforcement proceeding an industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-18.]


13.20.190 Reporting requirements.

A. An industrial user shall give notice to the town as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required in any of the following circumstances:

1. The alteration of or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source.

2. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of industrial wastewater into the SWTRF, any industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the town a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process.

The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance or pretreatment are necessary. This statement shall be reviewed by an authorized representative of an industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional as required by 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(6).

3. Any anticipated facility expansions, production increases, or process modifications which will result in new, different, or increased discharge of pollutants must be reported by submission of a new permit application. If such changes will not violate the discharge limits specified in the permit, an industrial user shall only be required to notify the town. Following such notice, the permit may be modified to specify and limit any pollutants not previously limited or change existing limits or other requirements. Approval must be obtained prior to any new discharge. The town shall review any such notice and respond within 120 days of its submission.

B. An industrial user shall give advance written notice to the town of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.

C. Permits are transferable only upon written notice to and written consent from the town. The town may require modification or reissuance of the permit to change the name of the industrial user and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under this chapter.

D. If the discharge is intermittent rather than continuous, then on the first day of each such intermittent discharge, the industrial user shall monitor and record data for all the characteristics listed in the monitoring requirements of the permit, after which the frequencies of analysis listed in the monitoring requirements of the permit shall apply for the duration of each such intermittent discharge. An industrial user shall be required to monitor and record data at twice the frequencies listed in the monitoring requirements of the permit. [Ord. 2002-05; prior code § 16-4-19.]

Chapter 13.35 PUBLIC NOTICE AND APPROVAL OF EXPANSION OF SERVICE AREA OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND RECLAMATION FACILITY AND CONSTRUCTION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND RECLAMATION FACILITIES

Sections:

13.35.010    Public notice and approval.


13.35.010 Public notice and approval.

A. The purpose of this section is to allow maximum citizen participation with respect to expansion of the boundaries of the service area (hereinafter “sewer service area boundaries”) of the Sahuarita wastewater treatment and reclamation facility (hereinafter “SWTRF”) and with respect to construction of new treatment and reclamation facilities within the sewer service area boundaries in order to preserve the quality of neighborhoods and adequate sewer service for residents within the sewer service area boundaries.

1. The sewer service area boundaries are the service area boundaries described in Section 5.1 and illustrated on Appendix Figure 1.1 of the Wastewater Management Plan for Sahuarita which was prepared by the town of Sahuarita in January 1999, and adopted as an amendment to the Pima Association of Government’s (“PAG”) Areawide 208 Plan by the PAG Regional Council on or about March 24, 1999 (hereinafter “208 Amendment of 1999”). The sewer service area boundaries are attached hereto as Exhibit “A.”

2. The SWTRF is the wastewater treatment and reclamation facility described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 and illustrated on Appendix Figure 3.4 of the 208 Amendment of 1999 attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and such additional parcels of land contiguous thereto which were acquired by the town of Sahuarita on or before September 1, 2006, for the purpose of operating the SWTRF.

3. This section does not prohibit such additions, replacements, expansions and repairs of and to the SWTRF as may be reasonable and necessary to provide service to users within the sewer service area boundaries.

4. This section shall not preclude or be applied to prohibit a connection of an additional school facility located on land contiguous to an existing public school facility located within the sewer service area boundaries, even though the addition may be located outside the sewer service area boundaries.

B. Unless authorized by a vote of the qualified electors of the town of Sahuarita as described in subsection D of this section, the town of Sahuarita shall not directly or indirectly cause, consent to, or participate in any of the following actions (hereinafter an “expansion”):

1. Expansion of the sewer service area boundaries;

2. Permit or require property located outside the sewer service area boundaries to connect to the SWTRF;

3. Any action that would permit or require the construction of any other wastewater treatment facility inside of the sewer service area boundaries or within 1,000 feet of the sewer service area boundaries.

C. If the electorate does not approve an expansion, then the town of Sahuarita shall not approve or authorize any annexation, general plan amendment, rezoning, tentative or final plat, development plan, building permit, acceptance of control or ownership of property, or sewage conveyance facilities if the effect of such approval or authorization would cause an expansion to occur. The town of Sahuarita shall not authorize the expenditure of funds for condemnation, right-of-way, acquisition, or construction of sewage conveyance facilities and/or cooperate with any other governmental authority or private entity which would cause or facilitate an expansion to occur if such expansion has not been duly approved by the electorate.

D. Voter approval for participation by the town of Sahuarita in any expansion shall be obtained by the mayor and town council at any regular or special election called for the purpose of approving or rejecting the proposed expansion (an “expansion election”). In an expansion election the registered voters of the town of Sahuarita shall be asked on the ballot to “approve” or “reject” the expansion for which the expansion election was called. The proposed expansion shall be described on the ballot in such detail that it may be reasonably understood, and shall include:

1. The specific location of property to be served;

2. The specific location of facilities to be constructed;

3. The boundaries of service areas to be expanded;

4. The impact upon the capacity of the SWTRF and conveyance systems then existing or planned to serve property within the sewer service area boundaries.

E. An expansion shall be “approved” only if a majority of the votes cast in an expansion election are cast in favor of an approval. If the voters reject the expansion, the mayor and council shall not permit the town, its staff, its consultants or its resources to be used to permit, support, facilitate or implement an expansion, and shall take such steps as may be reasonably available to prevent the expansion.

F. This section shall not prohibit the construction of any structure other than a wastewater treatment facility outside the sewer service area boundaries which does not require connection to the SWTRF, and shall not prohibit construction of a new wastewater treatment facility outside of and more than 1,000 feet away from the sewer service area boundaries.

G. If a provision of this section or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are severable.

H. As of the date of its adoption, the ordinance codified in this section supersedes any existing ordinance that conflicts with the terms hereof.

I. The provisions of this section apply to any application, proposal, submittal, amendment or other action pending as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section that would result in any expansion to occur.

14.05.070    Flood insurance study and flood insurance rate maps adopted.


14.05.010 Statutory authorization.

In ARS 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the town of Sahuarita to adopt regulations in conformance with ARS 48-3603 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the town council of the town of Sahuarita, Arizona, does adopt this Title 14. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.05.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. Flood losses may be exacerbated by the cumulative effects of obstructions to flow, inadequate anchoring of structures and encroachment into the floodplain. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.05.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

A. To protect human life and health;

B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding;

G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;

H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and

I. To maintain eligibility for disaster relief. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.05.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

To accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.05.050 Floodplain administrator designated.

The town engineer is designated as the floodplain administrator for the town and continues to serve as the community point of contact on National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) issues for county, state and federal officials. [Ord. 2011-059 § 1; Ord. 2006-15 § 1. Formerly 14.05.020.]


14.05.060 Authority.

The town of Sahuarita provides the floodplain management responsibilities under the NFIP, and is the entity responsible for floodplain administration within and outside of the FEMA floodplain. [Ord. 2011-059 § 2; Ord. 2006-15 § 3. Formerly 14.05.040.]


14.05.070 Flood insurance study and flood insurance rate maps adopted.

Those public records entitled “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Pima County, Arizona and Incorporated Areas” dated February 8, 1999 with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated June 16, 2011, and floodplain management regulations for Pima County dated November 21, 2005, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, three copies of which shall be kept on file in the office of the town clerk, are hereby adopted by reference, as the basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas for floodplain management in the town of Sahuarita. The special flood hazard areas documented in the flood insurance study and flood insurance rate maps are the minimum area of applicability of the floodplain management regulations and may be supplemented by studies for other areas as allowed in the regulations. [Ord. 2011-059 § 3; Ord. 2006-15 § 2. Formerly 14.05.030.]

“Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking or port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

“Governing body” means the town council of the town, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town.

“Hardship” related to Chapter 14.30 STC (Floodplain Variances) means the exceptional hardship which would result from a failure to grant the requested floodplain variance. The governing body requires that the floodplain variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a floodplain variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure.

“Historic structure” means any structure that is:

1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary; or

4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either:

a. By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary; or

b. Directly by the Secretary in states without approved programs.

“Levee” means a manmade structure designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

“Locally regulated floodplain” means floodplains in the town associated with washes and/or sheet flow areas having a base flood discharge of 100 cfs or more.

“Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this title.

“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle.

“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into manufactured home lots for sale or rent per STC Title 18 (Zoning).

“Market value” is determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation that has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

“Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s FIRM are referenced.

“New construction” means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, “new construction” means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.

“Nonconforming use” means an existing legal use that does not comply with this title and was either:

1. Constructed prior to December 16, 1974, which predates the requirement for written authorization for development within a floodplain; or

2. Constructed on or after December 16, 1974, in compliance with the terms and conditions of the written authorization in effect at the time of construction.

“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

“One-hundred-year flood (100-year flood)” is a common name for the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. (See “Base flood” definition.)

“Person” means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle that is:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck;

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

“Regulatory flood elevation” means an elevation one foot above the base flood elevation for a watercourse for which the base flood elevation has been determined or as determined by the criteria developed by the director of ADWR for all other watercourses.

“Regulatory floodplain” means an area associated with a watercourse, including its channel, or any other floodplain or flood-prone area that would be inundated by the base flood, including all base floods where the 100-year peak discharge is 100 cfs or greater.

“Regulatory floodway” see “Floodway.”

“Repetitive loss structure” means a structure covered by a contract for flood insurance issued pursuant to the FIA that has incurred flood-related damage on two occasions during any 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event. In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim.

“Retention” means a drainage system which stops the downstream progress of flood waters by employing methods of containment and storage and uses infiltration, evaporation or re-use to dispose of stored waters, thereby eliminating basin contributions to the downstream flood peaks or volumes.

“Sheet flow area” see “Area of shallow flooding.”

“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area defined by FEMA within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year (base flood). These areas are designated as Zone A, AO, AH and AE on the FIRMs, and other areas determined by the criteria adopted by the Director of ADWR.

“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

“Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, which is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. “Structure” for insurance coverage purposes means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such a construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises.

“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. “Substantial damage” also means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a rolling 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.

“Variance, floodplain” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this title that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this title.

“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in this title is presumed to be in violation until that documentation is provided.

“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine and ponding areas. See also “Base flood elevation.”

“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. “Watercourse” includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur (e.g., the regulatory floodplain).

F. All floodplains/flood-prone areas and erosion hazard setbacks identified on previous and subsequent drainage studies commissioned by the town engineer. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.020 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The regulated areas of this title as outlined in this chapter are derived from a variety of sources, whose hydrologic and hydraulic data and maps of delineation are kept on file by the town at the Sahuarita Public Works Department, Sahuarita Municipal Complex, 375 West Sahuarita Center Way, Sahuarita, Arizona 85629. This information includes or will include:

A. The area of special flood hazard identified by FEMA in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The flood insurance study (FIS) for Pima County Arizona and incorporated areas, revised February 8, 1999,” with accompanying FIRMs dated February 8, 1999, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this title. The FIS, FIRMs, FBFM and amendments and corrections to the maps are all kept on file.

B. The FIS and FIRMs may be supplemented by studies for other areas that allow implementation of this title. The floodplain board, within the limits of the town, shall require developers to delineate, within areas where development is ongoing or imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by FEMA, the Director of Water Resources and the town.

C. Due to the episodic nature of natural flood events and the resulting changes to hydrologic and hydraulic conditions along watercourses within the town, base flood peak discharges, flow volumes, and associated regulatory floodplain and erosion hazard areas are subject to continuous revision. At a minimum, base flood values and base flood elevations shall meet or exceed the current values established by FEMA and reflect historic flood information and general, current watershed conditions. Current regulatory floodplain and erosion hazard area maps will be maintained by the floodplain administrator for the town and all watersheds which generate regulatory flood peak discharges exceeding 5,000 cfs for the base flood as determined.

D. The floodplain administrator may accept hydrologic and hydraulic studies prepared by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer as a delineation of regulatory floodplain and erosion hazard setback areas.

E. In all cases the most recently accepted information shall be used for floodplain management. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.030 Compliance.

All development of land, construction of residential, commercial or industrial structures, or future development on lands to which this title applies is subject to the terms of this title and other applicable regulations. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.040 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This title is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this title and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.050 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this title, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.060 Disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this title is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This title does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This title shall not create liability on the part of the town, its officers or employees, the state of Arizona, NFIA or FEMA, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this title or any administrative decision lawfully made under this title. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.15.070 Statutory exemptions.

14.25.080 Standards for excavations, including sand and gravel operations.

Excavations, including sand and gravel operations, may be permitted, provided the following minimum conditions are met in addition to any other requirements per the town code. Additional conditions apply for operations occurring within a regulatory floodway as required in STC 14.25.090.

A. Extraction of sand, gravel and other materials is allowed; provided, that excavations are not so located or of such depth, or width, or length or combination of depth-width-length as to present a hazard to structures (including but not limited to roads, bridges, culverts, and utilities), to the banks of watercourses, to other property, or which adversely affects groundwater recharge.

B. No stockpiling is permitted within special flood hazard areas of materials or tailings that may obstruct, divert, or retard the flow of floodwaters except as reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator on an individual floodplain use permit basis.

C. Due to the rapidly changing hydraulic characteristics of watercourses in the town, and the effects excavations have on these characteristics, floodplain use permits for excavations shall only be issued for a limited time period not to exceed one year, subject to annual renewal and review by the floodplain administrator. Renewals will only be granted after receipt and acceptance of a report by the operator showing that the sand and gravel excavations remain in compliance with the conditions of the previous floodplain use permit, current floodplain conditions and all current related floodplain management regulations.

D. In addition to those conditions provided for elsewhere, floodplain use permits for excavations may impose site-specific conditions based upon hydraulics and sediment transport regarding the area and location in which excavations are allowed, the maximum amount of material to be excavated, and other reasonable restraints on the methods of operating in relationship to the floodplain conditions.

E. The floodplain administrator may require hydrologic, hydraulic and geomorphic analyses addressing the existing conditions as well as the impacts under the proposed method of operation. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.25.090 Floodway requirements.

Located within special flood hazard areas established in STC 14.15.020 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential. Encroachments are prohibited in the floodway, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development. The following subsections clarify how the floodway may be developed:

A. The following open space uses are permitted within the floodway to the extent that they are not prohibited by any provision of this title or any other ordinance, law or regulation, and provided they do not require fill, excavation, or the storage of materials or equipment:

1. Agricultural uses, including general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.

2. Industrial-commercial uses such as loading areas, airport landing strips, and parking areas.

3. Private and public recreational uses, including golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launch ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.

4. Accessory residential uses, including lawn gardens, parking areas and play areas.

B. Excavations, including sand and gravel operations, may occur in the floodway under the following conditions in addition to those required in STC 14.25.080:

1. There shall be no stockpiling of materials or tailings within the floodway.

2. Excavations may be allowed only in those reaches of watercourses which have, at a minimum, a balanced sediment system; that is, the sediment coming into the reach is equal to or greater than the sediment leaving the reach and the long-term sediment balance for the entire river system indicates that the stream channel will aggrade.

C. Flood control structures designed to protect life or property from the dangers or hazards of floodwaters are permitted, provided all other provisions of this title are met.

D. No use shall be allowed which:

1. Acting alone or in combination with existing or future uses creates danger or hazard to life or property. In determining whether a use creates a danger or hazard to property, the floodplain administrator may require a certification by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer that the proposed use will not result in any increase in the floodway elevations during the occurrence of the base flood nor will the proposed use divert, retard or obstruct the flow of flood waters.

2. Increases the regulatory floodway elevation.

3. Adversely affects groundwater recharge.

4. Increases erosion potential upstream and/or downstream.

5. Places a waste disposal system wholly or partially in a floodway. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.25.100 Erosion hazard setback requirements.

Close proximity to watercourses poses a hazard to development due to lateral erosion. Per STC 14.15.010, the erosion hazard setback area of a watercourse is a land covered by this title.

A. Along natural watercourses where unusual geology, sinuosity or similar physical conditions exist, the erosion hazard setback shall be established on a case-by-case basis by the floodplain administrator, unless an engineering study is done to establish the limits by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator.

B. Along incised natural watercourses where no unusual geology, sinuosity or similar conditions exist, a standard setback measured from the top of the primary channel bank shall be provided at the time of development. The setback may be reduced by an engineering analysis performed by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator in accordance with subsection D of this section.

C. Along non-incised natural watercourses (i.e., sheet flow areas) where no unusual geology, sinuosity or similar conditions exist, a standard setback measured from the base flood limits shall be provided at the time of development. The setback may be reduced by an engineering analysis performed by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator in accordance with subsection D of this section.

D. Standard erosion hazard setbacks may be reduced by an engineering study performed by an Arizona registered professional civil engineer and accepted by the floodplain administrator. The reduced setbacks shall not fall below minimum allowable erosion hazard setbacks unless the study also includes an analysis performed by an Arizona registered professional engineer. The following table shows the standard and minimum allowable setbacks when no physical construction is made to prevent erosion hazard:

	Base Flood Flow Rate (cfs)	Standard Erosion Hazard Setback (feet)	Minimum Allowable Erosion Hazard Setback (feet)

	< 500	25	15

	500 – 1,999	50	25

	2,000 – 4,999	75	45

	5,000 – 9,999	100	70

	10,000 and greater	250	175

	Santa Cruz River	500	350

[Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.25.110 Detention and retention requirements.

A. Any development with a residential density of three or more units per acre, or any residential development larger than one acre that has a density of six units per developed acre, as well as all proposed commercial and industrial developments shall provide some method of peak and/or volumetric runoff reduction. The amount of reduction is stipulated in the 1991 edition of the Pima County Storm Water Detention/Retention Manual. The peak runoff reduction shall be provided through detention of storm water and storm water harvesting for irrigation where possible.

B. Balanced and critical drainage basins are watersheds that have been identified by the Chief Engineer of the Pima County Flood Control District on a 1987 map as unsuitable for increased development because of the high probability of increased flooding with development and the potential for flooding of existing improvements or property. The floodplain administrator shall maintain this map of critical and balanced basins within the jurisdictional limits of the town. Drainage basins that have not previously been identified as unsuitable for additional urban development shall be considered balanced basins, but upon study by the floodplain administrator, may be classified as critical basins. Critical and balanced basins may be developed further only upon the incorporation of adequate detention systems or flood control facilities, as reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator. These detention systems or flood control facilities shall be incorporated into any and all future basin-development proposals, regardless of size or land-use density.

C. Structural flood control measures may be proposed in conjunction with, or in place of detention/retention systems if it can be clearly demonstrated that such measures will not alter the water and sediment equilibrium of the affected watercourse, and will mitigate environmental impacts. Structural flood control measures, such as channelization to a logical conclusion downstream of the proposed development and/or improvements to existing off-site flood control systems within the applicable drainage or stream reach, shall be completed in accordance with plans reviewed and accepted by the floodplain administrator.

D. Localized areas lacking sufficient improved or natural receiving waters into which runoff may be discharged may be required to follow alternative drainage solutions including complete retention practices as directed by the town engineer.

E. A fee may be collected by the town in lieu of detention/retention system when it can be clearly demonstrated that the detention at the site does not provide off-site flood relief due to the parcel size, location within the drainage basin, or other factors. The fees collected will be used to construct public flood control improvements that will mitigate the potential damage of flood waters originating from the property contributing the fees. In balanced and critical drainage basins, and where development is less than three units per acre, use of a fee system will be encouraged in lieu of a detention system to preserve the natural drainage patterns. The fee shall be equivalent to the cost of a detention system that would otherwise be constructed for the development to mitigate increased storm water runoff created by the proposed development. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.25.120 Access requirements.

A. Developments shall provide all-weather access in accordance with the following requirements:

1. Developments that fall under the requirements of subdivisions of 10 or fewer lots as provided in STC Title 18 (Zoning) shall provide all-weather access from each lot to the subdivision entrance. All-weather access shall be constructed from the subdivision entrance to the nearest paved public roadway. This requirement may be waived if the following criteria are met:

a. Subdivision is characterized as a residential subdivision.

b. Subdivision is of a rural character, with minimum lot sizes of 36,000 square feet.

c. If, in the determination of the floodplain administrator, it is not reasonably feasible to construct such access to the subdivision entrance.

d. Provisions of subsection B of this section are to be utilized.

2. All subdivisions that do not fall under the preceding requirements shall provide all-weather access from each lot to a paved public right-of-way. A subdivision with more than one access to a paved public roadway need only have one all-weather access.

3. All commercial developments shall provide all-weather access from a paved public roadway to all public portions of their site. Nonpublic portions of a commercial development that are not all-weather access shall be gated and signs posted in accordance with subsection B of this section.

4. Private residential construction not part of a recorded subdivision shall construct an all-weather access from the property boundary to a paved public roadway. If in the determination of the floodplain administrator it is not reasonably feasible to construct such access to the property, then provisions of subsection B of this section may be utilized.

B. The floodplain administrator may allow certain exemptions to all-weather access as stated in the preceding section. A condition of allowing this exemption is that the owner shall execute and record a covenant running with the land enforceable by the town which contains the following:

1. An acknowledgement that the vehicular access may be impassable to conventional motor vehicles and emergency vehicles in times of flooding;

2. A hold harmless provision, holding the town, its agents, and the floodplain management board harmless from and against all injuries and damages resulting from traversing or attempting to traverse the vehicle access during times of flooding; and

3. The covenant, successors and assigns shall erect and maintain a sign(s) in a location(s) and size(s) acceptable to the town stating “DO NOT ENTER WHEN FLOODED.” [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]

a. Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited storage;

b. The portions of the accessory structure located below the regulatory flood elevation must be built using flood-resistant materials;

c. The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement;

d. Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the regulatory flood elevation;

e. The accessory structure must comply with floodplain encroachment provisions; and

f. The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of flood waters.

2. Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in STC 14.25.010. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


Chapter 14.30 FLOODPLAIN VARIANCE PROCEDURE

Sections:

14.30.010    Nature of floodplain variances.

14.30.020    Appeal board.

14.30.030    Conditions for floodplain variances.


14.30.010 Nature of floodplain variances.

Floodplain variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A floodplain variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners.

Floodplain variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this title shall be granted only in rare situations. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if floodplain variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the floodplain variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a floodplain variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a floodplain variance are more appropriate. [Ord. 2011-059 § 4.]


14.30.020 Appeal board.

A. The floodplain board of the town shall hear and decide appeals and requests for floodplain variances from the requirements of this title.

B. The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title.

C. In considering applications, the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property and all of its habitable structures in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges.

D. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C of this section and the purposes of this title, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of floodplain variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title.

E. Any applicant to whom a floodplain variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a floodplain variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage;

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and

3. The land upon which the floodplain variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided for by Arizona Revised Statutes.

14.30.030 Conditions for floodplain variances.

A. Floodplain variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation, restoration, or floodproofing of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

B. Floodplain variances may be issued for accessory structures used solely for limited storage that have a size of less than 150 square feet; provided, that the following requirements are met:

1. Structure is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement;

2. The portions of the structure located below the BFE are constructed of flood-resistant materials;

3. The structure is designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters;

5. The structure does not violate any floodway requirements.

C. Floodplain variances may be issued for agricultural structures whose use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock, such as pole and pre-fabricated metal structures, grain bins and corn cribs; provided, that the following requirements are met:

1. The structure is designed in a manner that results in minimal damage from flooding;

E. Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the floodplain variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

F. Floodplain variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the floodplain variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3. A showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in STC 14.10.020 in the definition of “functionally dependent use;” and

a. The municipality may acquire by purchase or condemnation private property for the removal of nonconforming uses and structures. The elimination of such nonconforming uses and structures in a zoned district is for a public purpose.

b. A municipality shall not require as a condition for a permit or for any approval, or otherwise cause, an owner or possessor of property to waive the right to continue an existing nonconforming outdoor advertising use or structure without acquiring the use or structure by purchase or condemnation and paying just compensation unless the municipality, at its option, allows the use or structure to be relocated to a comparable site in the municipality with the same or a similar zoning classification, or to another site in the municipality acceptable to both the municipality and the owner of the use or structure, and the use or structure is relocated to the other site.

Notwithstanding any other law, a municipality shall not consider each day that an outdoor advertising use or structure is illegally erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered or maintained as a separate offense unless the violation constitutes an immediate threat to the health and safety of the general public.

18.42.040    Development standards.


18.42.010 Purpose.

A. General Purpose of Business Zones. The purpose of the business zones is to:

1. Provide for the orderly, well planned, and balanced growth of commercial areas.

2. Plan for and allow office and commercial development to expand the variety of goods and services to meet the needs of Sahuarita residents and those living within Sahuarita’s market area.

3. Allow mixed-use commercial/residential development, where consistent with the general plan, to promote less reliance on automobiles for mobility and to provide a wider range of residential options within Sahuarita.

4. Establish development standards that improve the visual quality of commercial and mixed-use development and create a unified, distinctive, and attractive character along commercial streets.

B. Specific Purposes of Each Zone.

1. NC Neighborhood Commercial. The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) zoning district provides for the development of smaller shops and services in convenient locations to meet the daily needs of families in the immediate residential neighborhood. The intent of the NC zoning district is to create a pedestrian friendly, neighborhood environment while protecting adjoining residential districts by permitting a limited group of commercial, office, or service uses.

2. B-1 Local Business Zone. The Local Business (B-1) zoning district provides for retail, office, and service activities to satisfy the needs of the community with emphasis on shopping centers and clustered office and commercial developments. The uses found within the B-1 zoning district serve both neighborhood and community level needs. The intent of this district is to discourage the random sprawl of strip commercial development by concentrating community-serving businesses and services in commercial centers oriented to road intersections rather than in a strip or linear pattern.

3. B-2 General Business Zone. The General Business (B-2) Zone is intended to accommodate large-scale commercial establishments or developments that provide goods and services to a community-wide and regional trade area.

4. MX Mixed-Use Zone. The Mixed-Use (MX) Zone is intended to provide areas for a variety of purposes including employment centers, retail and service commercial uses, medical and professional offices, and higher density residential uses. [Ord. 2015-105 § 1.]

18.60.070 Wireless communication facilities in the public right-of-way.

This section provides standards necessary for the preservation of the public right-of-way in the town for the maximum benefit and use for the public and applies to the siting, construction or modification of any and all wireless communications facilities proposed to be located in the public right-of-way.

A. Any application for a wireless communication facility to be located in the public right-of-way is subject to approval by the town engineer in addition to other requirements and processes specified in this chapter. Location or collocation of wireless equipment on town-owned poles shall be at the discretion of the town engineer.

B. Eligible Applicants. Only applicants who have been granted the right to enter the public right-of-way pursuant to state or federal law, or who have entered into a franchise agreement with the town permitting them to use the public right-of-way, shall be eligible to apply to install or modify a wireless communication facility or a collocation of such a facility in the right-of-way. A valid right-of-way use permit shall also be required prior to construction.

C. Speculative Equipment Prohibited. The town finds that the practice of “preapproving” wireless equipment or other improvements that the applicant does not presently intend to install but may wish to install at some undetermined future time does not serve the public’s best interest. The town shall not approve any equipment or other improvements in connection with a wireless communication facility application when the applicant does not actually and presently intend to install such equipment or construct such improvements.

D. No applicant seeking to install wireless antennas shall seek a right-of-way use permit for fiber or coaxial cable only. Applicants shall simultaneously apply for fiber installation or other cable installation when seeking to install antennas in the right-of-way.

E. Application. Applications for a wireless communication facility in the right-of-way shall include, in addition to other application requirements as stated in this chapter, the following:

1. The applicant shall employ screening, undergrounding and camouflage design techniques in the design and placement of wireless communication facilities in order to ensure that the facility is as visually screened as possible, to prevent the facility from dominating the surrounding area and to minimize significant view impacts from surrounding properties all in a manner that achieves compatibility with the community.

2. Screening shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with surrounding structures using appropriate techniques to camouflage, disguise, and/or blend into the environment, including landscaping, color, and other techniques to minimize the facility’s visual impact.

3. Facilities shall be located such that views from an adjacent residential structure are not significantly impaired.

4. Traffic Safety. All facilities shall be designed and located in such a manner as to avoid adverse impacts on traffic safety, including, but not limited to, being located outside of sight visibility triangles and clear zones.

5. All facilities shall be of subdued colors and nonreflective materials that blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures.

6. The applicant shall use the least visible equipment possible. Antenna elements shall be flush mounted, to the extent feasible. All antenna mounts shall be designed so as not to preclude possible future collocation by the same or other operators or carriers. Unless otherwise provided in this section, antennas shall be situated as close to the ground as possible.

7. Poles.

a. Only pole-mounted antennas shall be permitted in the right-of-way. All other telecommunications towers are prohibited, and no new poles are permitted that are not replacing existing poles, unless:

(1) Such new poles shall be designed to resemble existing poles in the right-of-way near that location, including size, height, color, materials, and style, with the exception of any existing pole designs that are scheduled to be removed and not replaced.

(2) Such new poles that are not replacement poles shall be located at least 90 feet from any existing pole to the extent feasible.

(3) A new pole analysis shall be submitted to demonstrate that the new pole is designed to be the minimum functional height and width required to support the proposed facility.

(4) All cables, including, but not limited to, electrical and utility cables, shall be run within the interior of the pole and shall be camouflaged or hidden to the fullest extent possible. 

(5) No new wooden poles shall be permitted. For collocations on existing wooden poles wherein interior installation is infeasible, antennas, conduit, cables, and any other appurtenances attached to the exterior of the poles shall be mounted flush thereto and painted to match the pole.

b. The maximum height of any antenna shall not exceed:

(1) Four feet above the height of the existing pole.

18.62.040 Substantial change criteria.

A proposed facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria:

A. For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than 10 percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than 10 percent or more than 10 feet, whichever is greater.

B. Changes in height shall be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height shall be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.

C. For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet.

D. For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public right-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than 10 percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure.

E. It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site.

F. It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure.

G. It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in this section. [Ord. 2016-110 § 1.]

18.65.050 Description of regulated riparian habitat.

A. For purposes of this chapter, “a regulated riparian habitat” is defined by the riparian classification maps adopted by the town council. These habitats are generally characterized by vegetation that is different in plant species composition or an increase in the size and/or density of vegetation as compared to upland areas. They occur in association with regulatory floodplains through which waters flow at least periodically, as well as any spring, cienega, lake, watercourse, river, stream, creek, wash, arroyo, or other body of water. These communities represent a continuum of plant species’ response to available moisture. 

B. Regulated riparian habitats are divided into three classifications and provide ecological connectivity and biological corridors.

1. Hydroriparian. Riparian habitats generally associated with perennial watercourses and/or springs. Plant communities are dominated by obligate or preferential wetland plant species such as willow and cottonwood. 

2. Mesoriparian. Riparian habitats generally associated with perennial or intermittent watercourses or shallow groundwater. Plant communities may be dominated by species that are also found in drier habitats (e.g., mesquite), but contain some preferential riparian plant species such as ash or netleaf hackberry. 

3. Xeroriparian. Riparian habitats generally associated with an ephemeral water supply. These communities typically contain plant species also found in upland habitats; however, these plants are typically larger and/or occur at higher densities than adjacent uplands. Xeroriparian habitat is typically divided into four subclasses, three are recognized by the town: class A, B, and C habitat. Mitigation in xeroriparian habitat is to be determined based at least on total vegetative volume (TVV) as provided within the mitigation standards as well as replacement of other lost riparian habitat functions necessary to sustain riparian habitat. [Ord. 2013-077 § 3.]


18.65.060 Habitat disturbance.

A. Riparian habitat disturbance that requires submittal of a mitigation plan:

1. Any disturbance of hydroriparian or mesoriparian habitat.

2. Disturbances to xeroriparian class A, B, and C riparian habitat are measured according to the following chart:

	Habitat Area	Disturbance Trigger for Mitigation

	Up to 10 acres	1/3 of an acre disturbance or greater

	10.01 – 50 acres	1 acre of disturbance or greater

	50.01 – 100 acres	1.5 acres of disturbance or greater

	Greater than 100 acres	2 acres of disturbance or greater

B. Riparian habitat disturbance that requires submittal of a site plan includes disturbances less than one-third of an acre of xeroriparian A, B and C habitat.

C. Review and approval of a mitigation plan by the planning and building director are required for disturbances listed in subsection A of this section.

D. Review and approval of a site plan by the planning and building director are required prior to habitat disturbance.

1. Submittal of a site plan is required when less than one-third of an acre of xeroriparian A, B or C habitat is disturbed.

2. The site plan must be prepared according to STC 18.65.080(C)(2). [Ord. 2015-098 § 1; Ord. 2013-077 § 3.]


18.65.070 Mitigation.

A. Prior to submittal of a mitigation plan, the applicant shall schedule a development review committee (DRC) meeting with the planning department.

B. After the applicant has had a DRC meeting, the applicant may move forward and revise the location of riparian habitat location on the project site and file a map correction.

C. The riparian habitat maps indicate the general location of riparian habitat. When applied to a smaller scale or specific parcel, corrections of riparian habitat boundaries may be needed. The property owner may request a revision to the riparian habitat boundary. The property owner must conduct a field study according to Appendix F (Field Mapping and Onsite Vegetation Survey) in the Riparian Habitat Mitigation Standards and Implementation Guidelines manual and submit an exhibit that demonstrates that the existing habitat boundaries are not accurate. The study must be sealed by a licensed landscape architect, qualified biologist, arborist or registered engineer. 

D. Classification Riparian Map Review.

1. Review by the planning and building director is required to verify the field study and proposed location of riparian habitat on the project site.

2. The planning and building director will consult with the town engineer to determine if the field study is complete and can be used to modify the location of on-site riparian habitat.

E. The applicant is required to consult with the town engineer/floodplain administrator regarding floodplain permitting prior to submittal of a mitigation plan and prior to any disturbance of the site.

F. All mitigation plans submitted shall be reviewed by planning staff and the DRC. The DRC shall provide a recommendation to the planning and building director.

G. Mitigation plans submitted must be accompanied by exhibits and narratives that demonstrate that disturbance of regulated riparian habitat cannot reasonably be avoided. These exhibits and narratives must show the applicant has attempted some of the following approaches to their project:

1. Avoidance of habitat.

J. For larger developments, an alternative to providing a mitigation plan for xeroriparian habitat A, B and C is available in the form of a conservation plan.

1. Applicants may propose a conservation plan as an alternative to a riparian habitat mitigation plan. 

2. A conservation plan is designed to support the success of on-site preservation of riparian areas and the mitigation of disturbed habitat, as well as serve the special needs of a given project within the context of its natural resources, both upland and riparian. 

3. A conservation plan may be an available option when traditional on-site mitigation does not address unique ecological or project conditions. 

4. The proposed conservation plan must preserve, enhance, provide connectivity, overall function, and/or restore an impacted riparian system and/or its surrounding areas. This can be performed by submitting proposals for an on-site riparian habitat exchange, restoration, or preservation of habitat to the planning and building director for approval. 

5. Proposal of a conservation plan is subject to the discretion and approval of the planning and building director in consultation with the town engineer, acting as floodplain administrator.

6. A conservation plan is approved by the planning and building director in consultation with the town engineer, acting as floodplain administrator.

K. A site proposed for development may have areas located outside the mapped regulated riparian habitat that have a similar or greater ecological value as the mapped habitat. The property owner has the option to quantify these areas by surveying and delineating the area proposed for protection.

1. In order for a habitat to qualify for an on-site exchange, restoration or preservation, the regulated riparian habitat proposed for disturbance and proposed habitat for exchange must be surveyed to verify the riparian habitats are of equivalent ecological value and part of the same parcel planned for development prior to proposal for an on-site habitat exchange.

L. Acceptable methods used to prepare a mitigation plan are identified in the town document titled Riparian Habitat Mitigation Standards and Implementation Guidelines on file with the planning department. [Ord. 2015-098 § 1; Ord. 2013-077 § 3.]

B. The in-lieu fee option may be proposed after the applicant has attempted each of the following and shown that it cannot provide relief from disturbance: 

1. Avoidance is not possible and impacts to regulated riparian habitat have been minimized.

2. The ability to mitigate entirely on site has proven not feasible.

3. Use of the modification of development standards in riparian areas does not provide relief from disturbance to riparian habitat.

C. The in-lieu fee option is based on riparian classification, estimated cost of on-site mitigation, including monitoring and long-term maintenance and a consideration of inflation adjustment. The following items are required for submittal with the in-lieu fee proposal:

1. The in-lieu fee spreadsheet, as described in STC 18.65.070(I).

a. A standard value will be assigned for each mitigation component and will be based on average cost estimates obtained from a landscape architect, arborist, or biologist. The applicant is required to provide two cost estimates (within recent 90 days of submittal).

b. The average cost between the two estimates will be used to determine each spreadsheet component in order to calculate the in-lieu fee for the project. 

c. The spreadsheet will allow each component of the mitigation plan to be calculated separately so the total mitigation costs can be accurately assessed for each project.

2. A detailed site plan with the following information:

a. Title block with name and address of development (include on all sheets).

b. Graphic scale, north arrow, location map and a brief legal description of site location with township, range and section information.

k. Demonstration that disturbance of regulated riparian habitat cannot be avoided and attempts to minimize disturbance through the modification of development standards outlined in STC 18.65.100 have been attempted.

l. Demonstration that disturbance of regulated riparian habitat does not fracture landscape linkages and biological corridors but maintains the continuity of habitat.

m. All existing and proposed structures and conditions within 100 feet of project.

n. Legend with all symbols described.

o. Scaled vicinity map showing a one-square-mile area with project site at the center of the map.

p. Note all ground planes, i.e., asphalt, concrete, decomposed granite, etc.

18.73.020 Definitions.

A. Certain terms used in this chapter shall be defined as follows:

1. “Active water harvesting” means the collection of stormwater into containment systems for storage and later diversion to beneficial uses.

2. “Buffering” means the on-site use of landscaping elements, screening devices, open space, drainageways and landforms for reduction of the potentially adverse impacts of adjoining, dissimilar land uses.

3. “Bufferyard” means a unit of land together with required landscaping which may be required between land uses to eliminate or minimize conflicts between them.

4. “Effluent” means reclaimed wastewater.

5. “Environmental zone design principle” means the landscape management and design principle of identifying planting areas throughout the site that have, or will be designed to have, similar maintenance, irrigation and exposure requirements. Zones may range from arid to wet. The plant palette for each zone should clearly reflect the function and design objective of the zone. Application of this principle promotes rational site planning and efficient, attractive, cost-effective landscaping.

6. “Fence” means a structure usually made of posts or stakes joined together by boards, wire, or rails and erected to enclose an area, act as a barrier, serve as a boundary or screen an area.

7. “Gallons” means the container size generally accepted by trade professionals to denote or specify plant material size.

8. “Landscaping” means the combination of landscape elements in a designed, specific application which meets the purposes of this chapter. Landscape elements may include vegetation, such as trees, cacti, shrubs and groundcovers and other elements such as walls, earth berms, planters, walkways, patios and other architectural or structural elements.

9. “Mini-oasis design concept” means the landscape design technique of allocating a generous portion of a site’s landscape water where it will return maximum benefit in terms of cooling, aesthetic pleasure and exposure to people.

10. “Natural desert” means desert with native vegetation that is essentially undisturbed, with no grading.

11. “Passive water harvesting” means the collection of stormwater directly into water harvesting infiltration areas without the temporary storage of water in a containment system. Passive water harvesting includes landscape features such as swales, micro basins, flush curbs, and recessed planting areas.

12. “Rainwater harvesting” means the process of intercepting stormwater and putting it to beneficial use.

13. “Screen” means any landscaping or structure such as walls, landscaped berms, and hedges, used to conceal or reduce the negative visual and audio impacts of certain land uses or activities from streets or adjacent development. The height of a screen is measured from the highest finished grade abutting the element to be screened.

14. “Specimen plant” means a tree or shrub in prime condition that stands out on its own.

15. “Walls” mean any solid masonry structure intended for confinement, prevention of intrusion, boundary identification or screening of an activity or land use. [Ord. 2012-075 § 1; Ord. 2011-060 § 1.]

18.73.040 Screening and bufferyard requirements.

A. Scope.

1. Land use zones permitted by this code are ranked according to their land use intensity and restrictiveness (reference STC 18.05.010(B)). Ranking is based on the type and degree of nuisance or negative impact the more intensive use is likely to impose on less intensive, adjacent land uses. Bufferyards shall be provided between uses to minimize the negative effects of their dissimilarity.

B. Bufferyards.

1. Purpose. Both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and public street or road. The planting units required of bufferyards are calculated to function as buffers.

2. Natural desert bufferyards must provide trees. Any trees added to meet this requirement shall be grouped to buffer existing uses and to minimize disturbance of natural areas. Trees added to the natural desert bufferyards shall be chosen from the following: velvet mesquite, honey mesquite, blue palo verde, foothills palo verde, whitethorn acacia, catclaw acacia, desert willow and canyon hackberry, or be native to the site.

3. The length of bufferyards in linear feet does not include paved driveways or easements where planting is not allowed.

C. Location of Bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. No portion of a required bufferyard shall be located on an existing or dedicated public or private street right-of-way where future right-of-way lines have not been established. Where future right-of-way lines have been established by a plan or roadway project up to 50 percent of the required bufferyard may encroach into the right-of-way with town engineer’s approval. Portions of bufferyards in excess of the bufferyard requirement as determined by Tables 1 through 3 may be located on an existing or dedicated public or private street right-of-way in accordance with STC 18.73.030(L)(2).

D. Determination of Bufferyard Requirements. To determine the type of bufferyard required between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:

1. Identify the zoning district of the proposed use on Table 1, Minimum Bufferyard Required, codified in this section;

2. Identify the zoning district of the adjacent property or street frontage to the proposed use on Table 1;

3. Determine the bufferyard required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by referring the indicated letter designation from Table 1 to Tables 2 and 3 below. Choose from the bufferyard width options and follow the required number of plantings for that width.

18.75.050 Administrative modification of parking requirements.

The planning and building director may grant the following modifications of off-street parking requirements:

A. Calculation of Required Parking Spaces for Mixed-Use Development. The total number of required spaces for a development of two or more different land uses may be reduced to 90 percent of the sum of the cumulative amount required for each separate principal use.

B. Alternative Parking Analysis for Shared Parking or Mixed-Use Development. When a mix of uses creates staggered peak periods of parking demand, shared parking calculations shall be made to reduce the total amount of required parking for residential, retail, office, institutional and employment uses. A parking reduction plan reduces the total spaces required. There is no limit to the number of required spaces that may be reduced, provided the following standards are met:

1. The plan shall be prepared by a traffic engineer or similar transportation professional and approved by the development review committee;

2. The plan includes a traffic generation study and land use profile of the development;

3. The plan shows that the reduced parking will ensure sufficient parking for the proposed uses;

4. The plan does not impede safe passage of moving traffic and does not increase traffic congestion;

5. A covenant runs with the subdivision plat or development plan noting adherence to the range of uses covered by the reduction plan;

6. A future revision to the covenant restricting uses may require submittal of a revised plan or an increase in parking spaces;

7. A combined residential and nonresidential development must be in a single structure or unified development;

8. Pedestrian access is provided to and from the parking area and each building or use;

Such demonstration may include but is not limited to:

a. High quality construction materials, such as brick or natural stone;

b. Consistent sizes, styles, and colors across the development;

c. Enhanced landscaping around the sign base;

d. Greater spacing between signs along street frontages;

e. Fewer total number of signs; and/or

f. Signs of reduced heights and area.

2. Once approved, a comprehensive sign plan becomes the governing document for signs in a development, and permits will only be issued for signs shown on the comprehensive sign plan.

4. An existing nonconforming sign may be considered as part of a comprehensive sign plan.

5. With planning and zoning commission approval at a public hearing noticed per STC 18.91.060(A), a comprehensive sign plan may allow signage in which the total sign area budget for each sign type and height of freestanding signs exceeds the maximum otherwise allowed by five percent for each criterion met, up to a maximum of 20 percent. In no event may the comprehensive sign plan propose signage of a type that is otherwise prohibited by this chapter, and in no event may the height, number, or size of freeway-style signs exceed the maximum otherwise allowed. Increases in sign area budgets for a sign type or freestanding sign height shall be based on the following criteria:

a. An additional five percent for use of one or a combination of the following options in all illuminated signage:

(1) Halo illumination, prohibiting the use of white or off-white/ivory light sources; or

(2) Prohibition of the use of predominantly white or off-white/ivory internally illuminated lettering, logos or trademarks.

b. An additional five percent when each sign is related to all other signs maintained on the site by the incorporation of similar or identical elements, such as materials, sign copy, letter styles, color, illumination, method of attachment, and overall presentation.

c. An additional five percent for the use of native or natural, or native- or natural-look, sign construction materials or colors that are reflective of the surrounding desert and mountain environment, the purpose of which is improved and innovative sign design and an improved image of the use or development; a minimum of 75 percent of the sign structure shall be constructed of such native or natural, or native- or natural-look, materials.

d. An additional five percent for a sign plan that relates in form, proportion, scale, color, materials, surface treatment, overall sign size, and the size and style of the lettering to the function and architectural character of the building or premises on which they will be displayed, and which provides for signs that are placed in a logical location in relation to the overall composition of the building’s facade and do not cover any key architectural features or details of the facade.

E. Appeals. Any decision made by the planning and building director regarding a comprehensive sign plan may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission. Any decision made by the planning and zoning commission regarding a comprehensive sign plan may be appealed to the town council.

F. Amendment. Requests for amendments to previously approved comprehensive sign plans shall be submitted for review and approval by the planning and building director. The director may refer an amendment request to the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in STC 18.91.060(A).

G. Light Pole Banner Program. A comprehensive sign plan for a site larger than 10 acres may include light pole banners in accordance with the following:

1. The banners shall be of new material and may be permanent, subject to planning and building department approval of a maintenance program.

2. Banners shall be suspended from an individual light pole or similar structure located on private property.

3. Maximum area: 12.5 square feet per banner.

4. Maximum height from grade to top of banner: 20 feet.

5. Maximum horizontal dimension: three feet.

1. A commercial sign district may be formed by petition of all property owners to be included in the district.

2. Proposals to create a commercial sign district shall be submitted to the planning and building director for review and approval. Applicants must demonstrate:

a. Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian connections throughout the proposed commercial sign district; and

b. Public benefit resulting from the creation of such a commercial sign district.

3. Properties to be included in a commercial sign district must be adjacent. Properties separated by a street shall be considered adjacent for the purpose of this provision, unless separated by a freeway.

4. A commercial sign district shall not encompass greater than four separate development plan areas or 100 acres.

5. A commercial sign district shall coordinate the preparation and submission of the comprehensive sign plan and shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of signage approved in the comprehensive sign plan. [Ord. 2018-129 § 1; Ord. 2017-127 § 1.]

18.82.050  Review procedures.

A. Design standards are listed in STC 18.82.060. The standards reflect desired goals and policies for the town. Design approval by town staff is required prior to the issuance of a building permit. The standards include Requirements (R), Presumptions (P), and Considerations (C). 

1. Overcoming a Requirement. There is no administrative process to overcome a requirement. If it cannot be satisfied, an applicant may seek relief through the variance process. 

2. Overcoming a Presumption. A presumption that may be unsuitable for a given project may be waived if an applicant can demonstrate to the town staff that there is a good reason why the presumption is inappropriate. The town staff may approve an alternative that achieves the intent of the presumption. Appropriate reasons for overcoming a presumption include: 

a. Demonstrating that in this instance the underlying design principles will not be furthered by the application of the presumption; 

b. Showing that another design standard is enhanced by not applying the presumption; 

c. Explaining the unique site factors that make the presumption unworkable. 

Increases in the cost of development generally will not be an acceptable reason to waive a standard or determine a standard is inappropriate. 

In the event that a presumption is not incorporated or overcome, an appeal may be filed by the applicant with the town council in accordance with STC 18.82.080. 

3. Considerations. Inclusion of considerations is encouraged, but omission is not grounds for denying plan approval. 

4. Town staff may request additional information or require modifications of the proposed design as necessary to perform a complete review and obtain compliance with this section. [Ord. 2011-048 § 1; Ord. 1999-01 § 1.]
