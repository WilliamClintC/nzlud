SECTION 2.44: COMMERCIAL BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS (Ord. 04-03;
5/7/04). The purpose of this section is to provide design standards for the review and
approval of commercial buildings in order to achieve the following community
objectives:
• To encourage commercial and office building façade treatments that are
articulated and enhanced in order to reduce the massive scale and impersonal
appearance of large commercial and office buildings.
• To maintain and improve community character by creating a pedestrian scale
element for commercial projects.
• To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and building
relationships within the commercial and office districts.
• To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the design of
commercial and office buildings.
• To create a sense of “place” and add elements of uniqueness to commercial
projects, thereby boosting the value, quality and economic sustainability of Alpine
Township’s commercial areas.
• To promote the efficient use of commercial and office land via an intelligent
arrangement of buildings.
These standards are intended to balance the property owner’s right to develop land with
the cultivation of commercial projects that are built to human scale, create an attractive
street frontage, and incorporate means and materials that enhance visual interest,
economic value and retail market sustainability in the Alpine Township commercial
areas. (Ord. No. 08-01; 3/17/08)
A. Commercial Building Façades: (Ord. No. 08-01; 3/17/08)
See Chapter 1 (Definitions) for written and graphic definitions of “façade.”
Façade materials are to be complementary to existing or proposed commercial
buildings within and around the site, provided that such buildings adhere to the
standards herein. It is not intended to discourage contrasts in design materials, but
special attention shall be given to avoid adverse effects on the economic stability and
value of surrounding businesses.
1. Façade material and colors
At least 80% of the building façade must be constructed from one or more of the
following materials:
a. Traditional hard-coat stucco
b. Brick
c. Natural or cultured stone
d. Tinted and/or textured concrete masonry units
e. Glass

the façade.
4. Façade colors shall only be earth tone colors or muted landscape colors (e.g.,
blues, grays, greens, burgundy, etc.) with a low reflectance. Building trim and
accent areas may feature colors that blend visually, but not bright colors or
sparkly coatings.
5. All facades shall include materials consistent with, but not necessarily
identical to, those on the front. Use of markedly inferior materials for side and
rear facades shall be prohibited.
B. Wall Designs and Features
1. Facades visible from a public or private street or service drive shall be
designed to eliminate large expanses of blank walls. Among other methods,
this can be accomplished via the application of two (2) or more of the
following every fifty (50) feet in wall length:
a. Doors with corniced parapets over the main entry door
b. Display windows that orient street-level customers to products
c. Arched entryways, awnings, arcades or outdoor patios
d. An expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane
no less than twelve (12) inches in width, such as offsets, reveals or
projecting ribs. See Figure II-3.
e. Change in texture, color or masonry pattern
f. Pilasters, piers or columns
g. Other applications as approved by the Planning Commission.
At least one (1) of the elements above shall repeat horizontally or vertically.
Figure II-3.
Gen. Provisions 2.01-2.46
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 2 - 42 General Provisions
2. Façade walls more than one-hundred (100) feet in total length must also

1. Building facades shall exhibit clearly defined, highly visible and articulated
customer entrances that feature at least two (2) of the following:
a. Canopies or porticos
b. Overhangs
c. Recesses or projections of at least three (3) percent of wall length
d. Arcades
e. Raised cornice parapets over the door

Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 2 - 45 General Provisions
Figure II-8
2. Bright colors or sparkly coatings are prohibited on any roof area visible from a
public or private right-of-way or service drive. The rationale for this
requirement is to prevent roofs to draw so much attention that it serves as
signage. All metal roofs shall be designed to withstand weather elements,
and to not rust. Natural patinas are acceptable. (Ord. No. 08/01; 3/17/08)
F. Illumination of Building Facades (Ord. No. 08-01; 3/17/08)

6. All building façade lighting shall be included within the calculations of the
required lighting plan per Chapter 18.
G. Building Elevation Plan Submittal Requirements
At the time of application for site plan review, the applicant shall submit the appropriate
number of copies of the proposed building elevation plans and materials list to the
Alpine Township Planning Director. These will be distributed to the Planning
Commission or Site Plan Review Committee. The Planning Commission or Site Plan
Review Committee may seek comment from the Alpine Township Building Official
and/or a third-party architect to determine if and how the submitted plans meet the
standards of this Section. In order to assure compliance with this Section, the building
elevation plans and materials list shall be approved as part of the final site plan.
H. Exterior Renovations and Alterations to Existing Buildings
When exterior renovations, alterations or additions are made to an existing building in
the O-S, C-1, C-2, C-3 or C-PUD zone, the exterior facades of the entire building shall
be brought into compliance with the standards of this Section. However, the Planning
Commission or Site Plan Review Committee may moderate the extent of required
improvements based on the following standards:
1. The pre-existing building’s size, shape and construction materials.
2. The potential visual impact on adjacent sites.
3. The pre-existing building’s setbacks, location and orientation.
If the pre-existing building façade renovation, alteration or addition does not require
Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee approval, then the Alpine
Township Planning Director shall apply the standards noted above and decide the
extent of required improvements. (Ord. No. 08-01; 3/17/08)
SECTION 2.45: PUBLIC SIDEWALKS AND WALKWAYS (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
The purpose of this section is to provide standards for the review and approval of public
sidewalks and walkway systems in order to achieve the following community objectives:
1. To provide a safe onsite pedestrian access system.
2. To combine and coordinate non-motorized transportation networks into a
coherent and connected system.
3. To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the design of
development sites.
4. To increase site accessibility for people of all ages and abilities.
5. To promote the efficient use of land via an intelligent arrangement of onsite
improvements.
Public sidewalks and walkways shall be installed throughout the site. The Planning
Commission shall review the site plan to ensure a logical interconnection of pedestrian
access points. At a minimum, sidewalks and walkways shall connect focal points of
Gen. Provisions 2.01-2.46
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 2 - 47 General Provisions
non-motorized pedestrian activities, such as transits stops, street crossings, building
entry points and other pedestrian links.
Sidewalks of no less than six (6) feet in width shall be provided along the full length of a
building along any façade featuring a customer entrance, and along any façade abutting
public parking areas. Such sidewalks shall be located at least four (4) feet from the
façade of the building to provide room for planting beds for foundation landscaping,
except where features such as display windows, arcades or entryways are part of the
façade or when determined by the Planning Commission to be impractical or
unnecessary.
All internal sidewalks and walkways shall be distinguished from driving and parking
surfaces through the use of pavers, bricks or concrete, in order to enhance pedestrian
safety and add to the attractiveness of the walkway system.
Roadside public sidewalks may be placed in accordance with the standards of the Kent
County Road Commission or may be installed on private property with a public sidewalk
easement provided by the developer to Alpine Township. The latter may be desirable to
provide additional safety space between motorized traffic and pedestrians. The public
sidewalk easement document shall note that sidewalk maintenance is the responsibility
of the property owner.
SECTION 2.46 WIND ENERGY SYSTEM (WES) ALLOWED AS A PERMITTED USE.
(Ord. No. 09-01: 3/31/09)
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures by which the
installation and operation of a WES shall be regulated within the Township in order to
promote the safe, effective, and efficient use of wind energy. See Chapter 21 for
definition of Wind Energy System and all related definitions.
Any On-Site Use Wind Energy System, including Structure-Mounted WES, which is 65
feet or less in total height, shall be a permitted use in all zoning districts as an
accessory use, subject to the following:
(a) Each lot or parcel is allowed one Freestanding WES and an unlimited number of
Structure-Mounted WES.
(b) The height of the WES with the blade in vertical position shall not exceed 65 feet.
(c) A Freestanding WES shall be set back from all property lines a distance which is
at least equal to the height of the WES. No portion of the WES, including the guy
wire anchors, shall be located within or above the required front, side, or rear
yard setback.
Gen. Provisions 2.01-2.46
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 2 - 48 General Provisions
(d) A Structure-Mounted WES shall have a distance from the nearest property line
which is at least equal to the distance between the point of attachment to the
structure or building to the top of the WES with the blade in the vertical position.
Blade arcs created by a horizontal axis WES mounted on an existing structure
shall have a minimum clearance of eight feet. The minimum clearance height for
blade arcs created by a vertical axis WES mounted on an existing structure shall
be determined on a case by case basis based upon the design of the WES.
(e) Construction permits shall be required to be obtained from Alpine Township prior
to the construction and operation of an On-Site Use WES 65 feet or less in total
height. A permit shall be issued after an inspection of the WES by Alpine
Township or an authorized agent of the Township, and where the inspection finds
that the WES complies with all applicable state construction and electrical codes,
local building permit requirements, and all manufacturers’ installation instructions.
The WES shall not operate nor remain on the property unless all applicable
construction permits have been issued and complied with. A copy of the
manufacturer’s installation instructions and construction information shall be
provided to the Township.
(f) An On-Site Use WES may provide electrical power to more than one building,
provided the buildings are located on the same lot or parcel on which the WES is
located.
(g) An On-Site Use WES shall comply with the regulations of Section 21.09(b),
Standards For All Wind Energy Systems.

SECTION 3.06 RESTORATION AND REPAIR. Such repairs and maintenance
work as are required to keep a nonconforming building or structure in a sound
condition may be made. In the event any nonconforming building or structure
shall be damaged by fire or wind or an act of God or a public enemy or other
natural forces, including but not limited to wear, tear, and depreciation, it may be
rebuilt or restored provided the cost thereof shall not exceed 1/2 the value of
such building or structure as determined by the tax assessment rolls of the
Township at the time immediately preceding the damage from said causes,
except in the case where the damage is caused by wear, tear, or depreciation, it
may be rebuilt or restored, provided the cost thereof shall not exceed 1/2 the
value of said building or structure as determined by the tax assessment rolls of
the Township at the time the repairs or restoration is intended to be made; said
determination shall be made by the Building Inspector or an appeal by the Board
of Appeals.

(Ord. No. 19-03; 3/18/19)
SECTION 5.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is recognized that the public health and welfare of the citizens of Alpine Charter
Township, Kent County, the State of Michigan, and the United States are greatly
dependent upon the sustenance and economic benefits provided by a viable agriculture
industry. The regulations of the Agricultural Zone are intended to ensure that land
areas within Alpine Township which are well suited for production of food and fiber are
retained for such production, unimpeded by the establishment of incompatible uses
which would hinder farm operations and irretrievably deplete agricultural lands.
In establishing Agricultural zones, it is acknowledged that agriculture is a specialized
form of industry characterized by the production, through biological and botanical
processes, of saleable farm products as a result of the combination of raw materials
(soils, seeds, plants, water, and nutrients), manpower (farm labor and machinery), and
energy (solar and power equipment).
Other specific purposes for which this district is established include:
(a) To preserve woodlands and wetlands associated with farms which because of
their natural physical features, are useful as water retention, surface water
purification and groundwater recharge areas, and as habitat for plant and animal
life; and which have an important aesthetic and scenic value which contributes to
the unique character of the agricultural district.
(b) To provide the basis for land tax assessments which reflect its existing
agricultural nature and owing to these regulations, its limited use for other
purposes.
(c) To prevent the conversion of agricultural land to non-farm development which
when unregulated, unnecessarily increases the cost of public services to all
citizens and results in the premature dis-investment in agriculture.
(d) To protect farmland from speculative increases in land values.
(e) To prevent loss of farmland.
(f) To prevent conflicts between agricultural activities and residences.
(g) To prevent encroachment of urban and suburban services into agricultural areas.
5.01-5.08 Ag Zone
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 5-2 A, Agricultural
(h) To encourage long-term investment in improvements needed to maintain and

SECTION 6.01 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE. This district is intended to
provide for residential development in a rural setting close to agricultural land use
areas and zoning districts. With a density of one dwelling unit per one and one
half (1-1/2) acres, this zoning district will permit general and specialized farming
activities but on a much smaller scale than the Agricultural Zoning District.
The large lots and agricultural activities permitted in the R-A District are intended
to satisfy a demand for a semi-rural life style without using up prime agricultural
land.
The R-A Zone is also intended to serve as a transition or buffer zone between
the Agricultural zone and more intense land uses and divert development
pressure away from the large areas of unique farmland in Alpine Township. In
order to prolong the capacity of the R-A Zone and thereby preserve the integrity
of the Agricultural zoned areas, subdivision projects, whether platted or
unplatted, shall require special approval use as recommended by the Alpine
Township Master Plan. (Ord. No. 91-3; 8/26/91)
SECTION 6.02 USE REGULATIONS. Land in the R-A Zone may only be used
for the following purposes:

(d) Dairy farms.
(e) Tree and sod farms or other similar uses but not including retail sales on
the premises.
(f) Roadside stands for sale of produce of which at least fifty (50) percent is
grown on the same lot. Such use is permitted only if it is incidental to the
primary use of farming on the lot, and such buildings or structures may be

least forty (40) feet from the road right-of-way and have at least five (5)
off-street parking spaces. Such off-street parking spaces need not be
paved with asphalt or concrete. (Ord. 09-03; 11/3/09)
(g) Private stables subject to the following regulations:
(1) There shall be at least one acre of land for each horse kept on the
premises.
(2) The area on which the horses are kept shall be completely
enclosed by a fence or similar barrier to prevent trespass on
adjoining property or roadways.
(3) The premises shall be kept in a sanitary condition and the keeping
of horses shall not result in objectionable odors which would pose a
nuisance to nearby residents.
(h) Storing, packaging and processing of farm produce provided such
activities are done on a farm consisting of a lot of at least forty (40) acres
and that such storage, packaging or processing includes farm products
grown on that lot. Buildings or structures in which such uses occur on a
lot without any other building or structure, shall be considered the principal
building on the lot for purposes of this Ordinance. Canning and freezing
activities are prohibited. (Ord. 09-03; 11/3/09)

CHAPTER 14A
"OSN-PUD" - OPEN SPACE NEIGHBORHOOD
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
(Ord. No. 02-03; 8/1/02)
(Ord. No. 06-01; 2/26/06)
(Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
(Ord. No. 19-02; 2/108/19)
SECTION 14A.01 PURPOSE
It is the intent of this Chapter to offer an alternative means of developing residential property
through the use of an Open Space Neighborhood Planned Unit Development (OSN-PUD). The
OSN-PUD is a zoning district for master planned residential communities in which the most
important design feature is the identification and inclusion of land that is to be preserved or created
as open space. Most dwellings would abut this permanently preserved open space in order to
provide views and access for residents.
This Chapter sets forth requirements pertaining to the design of an Open Space Neighborhood
via the Planned Unit Development process. As with any land use planning endeavor, proper yet
visionary community design is essential. However, it is also understood that the property being
planned for an OSN-PUD must still be legally divided into lots via the land division, platting,
condominium, or site condominium process. As such, certain engineering realities should be
expected during the OSN-PUD design process, particularly when addressing mandatory public
utility extensions, stormwater management, and onsite grading work.
Some degree of flexibility is permitted in the use, height, bulk, and placement requirements for
OSN-PUD developments, but it is also intended that each OSN-PUD district will complement uses
that are near and adjacent to the OSN-PUD district. The OSN-PUD District is intended for the
following purposes:
a) Implementing the Township's Master Plan relating to preservation of open space, rural
character, and natural resources in the creation of well-planned residential
neighborhoods.
b) Encouraging the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability;
c) Assuring the preservation of open space and other natural resources and allowing for the
continuation of viable farming activities.
d) Providing active and/or passive recreational areas accessible to all residents of the OSNPUD;
e) Encouraging the provision of open space of a useable size and design;
f) Allowing innovation and greater flexibility in the design of master planned residential
developments;
g) Facilitating the construction and maintenance of streets, public utilities, and public
services in a more economical and efficient manner;
h) Ensuring compatibility of design, use, and density between neighboring properties and an
OSN-PUD zoning district, or as recommended by the current Master Plan;
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 2 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
i) Encouraging a more compact form of development, thus preserving open space as
undeveloped land or as maintained recreational space;
j) Providing a road design that provides connections throughout the development, rather
than utilizing numerous cul-de-sacs, and that provides traffic calming devices such as
shorter street segments, 90º turns, irregular street patterns, narrower streets, and access
to lots by shared drives and alleys.
k) Providing for neighborhood design which has a definable center and edges, and which
provides pedestrian links throughout the site.
l) Preserving and restoring wildlife habitat and native biological diversity.
m) Utilizing the “toolbox” methodology quantified within this ordinance to thoroughly plan and
design all onsite open space and built environment features, based in large part on the
pre-existing strengths and weaknesses of a particular site.
SECTION 14A.02 AUTHORIZATION AND PROCEDURE
An OSN-PUD may be approved by the Planning Commission and Township Board pursuant to
Chapter 22 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 14A.03 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
To be eligible for OSN-PUD consideration, the applicant must demonstrate that a proposed OSNPUD
meets the following criteria:
a) Location: An OSN-PUD may be approved in any location which is recommended for Rural
Estate or Low Density Residential uses by the Alpine Township Master Plan or is currently
within the Rural Agricultural or Low Density Residential zoning districts.
b) Recognizable Benefits: An OSN-PUD shall result in recognizable and substantial benefits
both to the residents of the project and to the overall quality of life in the Township. The
benefits can be provided through site design elements such as innovative architectural
design and quality housing stock, distribution of lots which would not result in as desirable
a development if developed separately, creative use of landscaping, sensitivity to adjacent
residential land uses, unique site design features, preservation and restoration of natural
features, or preservation of viable farm land and the reasonable maintenance of rural
appearance.
c) Minimum Size: Qualifying parcels must be a minimum of five contiguous acres.
d) Unified Control: The proposed development shall be under unified ownership or control,
so that one person or entity has proprietary responsibility and the ability to provide for the
full development of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of
ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed
restrictions to establish that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 3 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
SECTION 14A.04 DENSITY REQUIREMENTS
a) An OSN-PUD shall only be developed in accordance with the density and land uses
allowed by this Chapter. The permitted number of dwellings per acre (density) for a
proposed OSN-PUD shall be consistent the following table:
Density Table
Master Plan Category Comparable Zoning District OSN-PUD Maximum Density
Rural Estate Rural Agricultural .66 units/ac. (1.5 acres/unit)
Low Density Residential R1, Low Density Residential 3.0 units/ac.
To determine the maximum number of dwelling units which may be constructed within an
OSN-PUD, the permitted density from the Density Table above shall be multiplied by the
total acreage of the site, excluding those areas identified as Primary Conservation Areas
in Section 14A.8(d) as well as acreage within pre-development public road rights-of-way.
However, this maximum density may not be feasible when the 65’ lot width minimum noted
in Section 14A.07 and the required 35% of gross acreage Dedicated Open Space noted
in Section 14A.08(a) are applied to the actual PUD lot layout plan. Therefore, the actual
lot yield plan may be less than the permitted maximum number of dwelling units.
The Planning Commission and the Township Board may, based on the criteria contained
in this chapter, require fewer dwelling units than would otherwise be permitted by the
maximum density calculation noted in this Section to better protect the public health,
safety, and welfare.
SECTION 14A.05 PERMITTED USES
Land and buildings in an OSN PUD may only be used for the following uses or combination of
such uses:
a) Single family dwellings
b) Two-family dwellings. Two-family dwellings shall not constitute more than 15% of the total
dwelling units in an OSN-PUD.
c) Multi-family dwellings, provided that there are not more than four units per building and
the building is not more than one story in height. Multi-family dwellings shall not constitute
more than 15% of the total dwelling units in an OSN-PUD.
d) Other uses that are determined by the Township Board upon recommendation of the
Planning Commission to be consistent with the Alpine Township Master Plan and this
Ordinance.
e) Limited farming activities are permitted only if such activities are conducted upon the
Dedicated Open Space within the OSN-PUD. For purposes of this section farming
activities shall be limited to the growth and sale of crops, fruits, and vegetables and the
raising and keeping of farm animals.
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 4 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
f) Golf courses, tennis courts, ball fields, bike paths, walking paths, playground, community
buildings, and similar active and passive recreational facilities, provided that they are
designed to be used primarily by residents of the OSN-PUD.
g) Accessory uses, structures, and buildings that are customarily associated with the uses
specified above, shall be permitted in accordance with Section 2.01 of this Ordinance
unless specifically modified by the Planning Commission.
h) Any On-Site Use Wind Energy System, including Structure-Mounted Wind Energy
Systems, which is 65 feet or less in total height subject to Section 2.46 herein. (Ord. No.
09-01; 3/31/09)
SECTION 14A.06 USES PERMITTED SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION OF THE
TOWNSHIP BOARD
The following uses are also permitted within the OSN-PUD zone when specifically authorized by
the Township Board upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission. The uses shall be
developed in accordance with standards provided for PUDs and the specific standards applicable
to each use as set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, except that the Township Board in its
discretion may vary those specific standards in order to achieve the intent and purpose of the
PUD: (Ord. 06-01; 2/26/06) (Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
a) Housing for seniors or retired persons per Chapter 21 herein.
b) Any Wind Energy System, including Structure-Mounted Wind Energy Systems, which is
greater than 65 feet in total height and Anemometer (MET)Towers subject to Section
21.09 herein. (Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
SECTION 14A.07 DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The lot area, lot width, building setback, yard requirements, street frontage, and street widths
applicable within an OSN-PUD may be modified in order to achieve the objectives of this section,
if recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the Township Board. However,
each individual lot must be at least 65 feet in width from the front building setback throughout the
remaining depth of an individual parcel. In addition, a diversity of lot sizes may be required in
order to achieve a variety of housing types and to avoid the monotonous repetition of static lot
sizes often found in conventional subdivisions.
SECTION 14A.08 MINIMUM OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
a) An OSN-PUD shall provide and maintain a minimum of 35 percent of the gross parcel
area of the application site as Dedicated Open Space. Dedicated Open Space includes
all land within a PUD not devoted to a residential lots or units, accessory structures or
uses, vehicle access or parking areas, utility easements, roadways, or land improvements.
Dedicated Open Space shall be used for recreation, conservation, or preservation and
shall be connected to adjacent and future developments, open space, and bike paths.
b) All areas identified as Primary Conservation Areas per Section 14A.08(d) shall be
permanently preserved as dedicated open space. The Planning Commission shall
determine the actual amount of open space required, and may require more than 35
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 5 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
percent of the site to be dedicated open space based on Geographic Information System
analysis, biological surveys, topographical surveying data, the nature and intensity of the
proposed development, and compliance with the purposes of this section.
The specific types of Dedicated Open Space planned within an OSN-PUD must be chosen
from the “OSN-PUD Toolbox,” displayed on Figure 1.
c) Standards for Dedicated Open Space. The following standards shall apply to the
Dedicated Open Space required in an OSN-PUD:
1) Dedicated Open Space shall be available for use by all residents of the OSN-PUD.
2) At least one area of Dedicated Open Space shall be centrally located within the
development, insofar as it is feasible, and shall be maintained as an active recreational
area, such as a village green, playground, or ball field park. It is the intent of this
section that the centrally located open space be maintained in a more formal sense,
so as to promote community, visibility, monitoring, usability, and safety of the area.
3) Other than the centrally located Dedicated Open Space, other Dedicated Open
Spaces shall be located along the road frontage of the development, located to
preserve significant natural features, or located to connect open spaces throughout
the development and to open spaces on adjacent OSN-PUD properties.
4) If the pre-development site contains a lake, stream or other body of water, a significant
portion of the required Dedicated Open Space shall abut the body of water.
Greenways shall be established along watercourses whenever possible.
5) Narrow peripheral bands of open space may count toward up to 50% of the required
Dedicated Open Space if such peripheral open space provides a landscaped and
bermed visual buffer between land uses to create a more rural appearance from
adjacent roadways. Such open space must be at least 30’ wide, bermed to a height of
6’–10’, have at least 4’ of flat area across the top, be significantly landscaped and have
a side slope that supports lawn mowing equipment.
See Figure I, Type 4 for examples of useful peripheral open space.
6) If active recreational areas are proposed such as maintained village greens,
playgrounds, or ball fields, such areas shall be 62,500 square feet in area and at least
250 feet in length and width. The Planning Commission may approve limited active
recreational Dedicated Open Space areas of less than 62,500 square feet in area and
250 feet in length and width if such areas are designed and established as pedestrian
or bicycle paths for residents of the OSN-PUD.
These active recreational areas shall not utilize more than 60% of the overall 35%
required Dedicated Open Space area unless specifically approved by the Planning
Commission and Township Board. The remaining 40% (or more) shall be passive
open space consisting of primary or secondary conservation areas.
7) Pedestrian access points to the Dedicated Open Space areas shall be provided and
shall be clearly identified by signs and an improved path for safe and convenient
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 6 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
access. Except for boardwalks or gravel trails through natural areas, pathways shall
be paved.
8) Grading in Dedicated Open Spaces containing Primary Conservation Areas shall be
minimal, with the intent to preserve existing topography and limit soil erosion. Active
recreational areas shall be graded as flat as possible while still providing adequate
stormwater management and drainage controls.
9) Passive recreational areas shall be designed to revert to native forms of Michigan
vegetation, in order to restore biological diversity, preserve more rural appearances
and to allow for exploration of natural areas by OSN-PUD residents. In the case of
landscaped peripheral berms, more active maintenance may be prudent to improve
aesthetics and visual appeal. However, native Michigan species should be utilized
wherever possible in these landscaped areas.
10) A structure or building accessory to a recreation or conservation use may be erected
within the Dedicated Open Space, in accordance with an approved open space plan.
11)A non-motorized trail system shall be provided throughout the development. The
applicant shall provide linkage of the trail system to future neighborhoods and
developments that may occur adjacent to the development.
d) Primary Conservation Areas. The following forms of Dedicated Open Space shall be
preserved as “primary conservation areas:”
1) All wetlands and wet meadows (whether regulated or not)
2) All floodplains and drainageways (whether regulated or not)
3) Creeks, streams, ponds or lakes
4) Steep slopes (20% or over)
5) Habitats of unique or endangered species
6) Soils that will not sustain buildings
7) Woodlands wherein which at least 30% of the trees measure at least 10 inches in
diameter
The determination of the existence of all wetlands and floodplain areas on a parcel shall
be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission through a written
determination by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or by an analysis
performed by a professional biologist, professional wetland consultant, or similar
professional person deemed acceptable to the Planning Commission and Township
Board.
e) Secondary Conservation Areas. Where feasible, the following open spaces shall also be
preserved as “secondary conservation areas:”
1) Woodlands which are not part of the primary conservation area
2) Farm land
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 7 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
3) Meadows and hedgerows
4) Farm buildings and fences
5) Historic, cultural, and archeological features
6) Scenic views into and out of the site
7) Any other area which, due to significant natural or cultural features, is determined to
be worthy of preservation.
f) Open Space Preservation and Maintenance Agreement: Prior to approval of PUD
rezoning by the Township Board, the applicant shall provide an open space preservation
and maintenance agreement, in a form acceptable to the Township, providing that all
Dedicated Open Space (as referenced herein) portions of the development shall be
permanently protected from future development and maintained in the manner approved
by the Planning Commission and Township Board during the OSN-PUD review process.
Such documentation shall be in a form satisfactory to the Township Board and recorded
so as to bind all successors and future owners in title to commitments made as part of the
accepted project proposal. This provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or
control, provided notice of such transfer is provided to the Township and the Dedicated
Open Space land uses continue as approved in the OSN-PUD plan, unless the Township
Board approves an amendment.
The open space preservation and maintenance agreement is subject to approval by the
Township Board and may consist of covenants, conditions, and restrictions that run with
the land, a conservation easement established according to the Michigan Conservation
and Historic Preservation Act, Public Act 197 of 1980, as amended, or another comparable
substitute as determined by the Township Board.
The preservation and maintenance agreement shall, at a minimum:
1) Indicate the proposed uses and maximum intensity of use(s) within the Dedicated
Open Space.
2) Require that the Dedicated Open Space be maintained by parties or entities that have
an ownership interest in the open space.
3) Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the Dedicated Open Space including
necessary mowing, trash removal, irrigation, pruning of trees and new plantings to
replace withered or dead materials.
4) Provide an administrative mechanism for maintenance to be undertaken by Alpine
Township in the event that the Dedicated Open Space is inadequately maintained, as
determined by the Township, and becomes a public nuisance. Provisions shall be
made to ensure that any costs incurred by the Township to maintain shall be assessed
or apportioned to the owners of the property within the OSN-PUD.
5) Provide a legal instrument to permanently protect all Dedicated Open Space areas
from future development.
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 8 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
SECTION 14A.09 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL LOTS OR UNITS
The location of residential lots or units shall be based upon the following criteria:
a) In no case may residential lots or units extend into a primary conservation area.
Residential or units lots may extend into Secondary Conservation Areas, if approved by
the Planning Commission and Township Board.
b) Where practical, houses should be placed so that scenic views are left open or
uninterrupted, particularly as seen from the public road right-of-way.
c) Lots within an OSN-PUD are not required to have frontage on public streets or private
roadways. Lots within an OSN-PUD may face onto the walkways surrounding greens or
squares rather than directly onto streets. Such lots may take their vehicle access from
alleys or shared drives that serve the rears of these lots.
d) “Zero” lot lines on the sides of narrow lots may be permitted; side porches facing the
greater side yard of these lots are also encouraged.
e) All lots shall be accessible by emergency and public service vehicles.
f) The Township may require that garages not extend beyond the faces of houses served
by the garage. Garages located at the rears of lots may be accessed by alleys or drives
serving the lot.
g) To avoid the adjacent placement of identical home facades, the applicant shall provide the
Planning Commission and Township Board with a “non-repeat” plan for housing facades.
SECTION 14A.10 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR STREETS
The following criteria shall apply when locating and designing streets, trails, and greens. If the
applicant is also seeking approval for a private road, information and approval required by Section
2.34 herein shall also be submitted. Special land use permit approval is required for a private
road.
a) Streets shall be designed to minimize the area devoted to vehicle travel. The use of alleys
for access to rears of lots, as well as the use of shared drives, may be required.
b) Streets shall be designed to preserve existing tree lines and hedgerows.
c) Streets shall be designed to avoid crossing wetlands, wildlife habitat, or other sensitive
natural areas unless no other alternative route exists. Travel lanes may be split into a
boulevard-style street with natural areas between the travel lanes.
d) Streets shall be designed to avoid long street segments. Shorter straight segments at 90
degrees to each other are preferable, as well as irregular street patterns which combine
straight, angled, and curving street segments that increase visual appeal and help calm
traffic. The use of “T” intersections is encouraged.
e) Lanes or alleys serving lots shall have a pavement width of at least 14 feet; shared
driveways shall have a pavement width of at least 10 feet.
OSN-PUD 14A.01-14A.13
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14A - 9 Open Space Neighborhood - PUD
f) Street systems should be designed to produce terminal vistas (views) of open spaces,
village greens, water features, meadows, or playing fields.
g) Where practical, streets should allow single loading of house sites, which allows all homes
views of open spaces within the development.
h) Every effort should be made to connect streets so that dead ends are minimized, to
provide safe and efficient access for emergency and public service vehicles, and to avoid
conditions where certain residential streets become collectors that carry the majority of
neighborhood traffic.
i) Mid-block walkways shall be provided where a block is at least 800 feet long on at least
one side of the street. The Planning Commission shall determine the feasibility of such
walkways based upon the practicality of connections within and outside of the OSN-PUD.
j) Where cul-de-sacs are unavoidable, they should be provided with pedestrian and bike
linkages to nearby streets or adjoining neighborhoods. These cul-de-sacs should be
designed with a central island where existing trees can be preserved or native species
can be planted, in accordance with the Kent County Road Commission.
k) Streets shall be designed to connect with adjoining properties.
l) Street trees shall be installed on both sides of all streets (public and private) in accordance
with the approved landscaping plan. Trees shall either be massed at critical points,
spaced evenly along the street parkway, or both. A 40-foot minimum spacing interval shall
be utilized when placing street trees. Street trees species should be chosen for their ability
to withstand roadside environmental conditions. Tree type may vary depending on the
overall effect desired, but as a general rule, trees should be the same kind on a particular
street. The installation of street trees shall be the applicant’s responsibility and seasonal
mass plantings are encouraged to promote cost efficiency and improved survival of trees.
All street and canopy trees shall be at least of 2” caliper size. All evergreen trees shall be
at least 6 feet in height. Understory and flowering trees shall be at least 1.5” caliper in
size.
SECTION 14A.11 LANDSCAPING PLAN REQUIRED
a) Plan Content. A landscaping plan prepared by a registered landscape architect shall be
submitted with an OSN-PUD application. The plan shall identify proposed trees, shrubs,
ground covers and other landscaping elements. The plan shall identify where plantings
will be located as well as planting/construction/phasing details. Where existing natural
growth will be preserved, the plan must detail methods to protect existing vegetation
during and after construction.

SECTION 14A.12 STORMWATER AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES
All OSN-PUD projects must provide for adequate onsite stormwater and drainage facilities, in
compliance with Ordinance #01-06, as amended. Based on their design, stormwater and
drainage facilities will be classified and reviewed in accordance with the following designations:
a) Functional: This facility is designed only for engineering functionality and may be
necessary in certain situations. Functional detention basins, headwalls, outlet structures,
concrete flow channels, rip rap channels, and other drainage improvements must be
screened with plant material and berms.
b) Functional and Created Wetlands: These types of facilities combine functional designs
with wetland creation techniques. These types of facilities must be carefully designed to
ensure long-term functionality and maintenance provisions. The detention basin
embankment and the basin itself must be extensively planted with wet tolerant plant
materials with the intention of re-creating a seasonal and high water wet ecosystem.
c) Functional and Aesthetic: These types of facilities combine functional design with
landscape architecture and active/passive recreation potential. These facilities are
detailed in Figure 1, Type 8. These ponds must be developed both as functional utilities
and neighborhood amenities. Aeration of wet ponds and created lakes is required. Such
facilities cannot be allowed to become a visual nuisance. As such, ongoing maintenance
of these facilities is essential, either by the public drain district process or as noted in the
required OSN-PUD operation and maintenance agreement noted in Section 14A.09(c).
SECTION 14A.13 SIGNS
Signage within an OSN-PUD shall comply with the regulations for the proposed uses contained
in Chapter 20, Signs of the Alpine Township Zoning Ordinance.

CHAPTER 14B
"M-PUD" - MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
(Ord. No. 08-05; 12/2/08) (Ord. No 09-01; 3/31/09) (Ord. No. 19-02; 2/18/19)
SECTION 14B.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE. The purpose of the “M-PUD” Zoning District is
to permit a variety of uses to be located on the same site and/or within the same buildings and to
enable these uses to function in an integrated fashion as a community or neighborhood without
the separation that is usually required by traditional zoning development standards. The M-PUD
zoning district is not intended to be developed with a single type of land use. Uses shall be
integrated in such a manner that they are compatible in form and function.
The M-PUD shall be designed to promote interaction among residents and users through the use
of pedestrian walkways, by connecting uses on site through building placement and appearance,
through preservation of open space, and the provision of public places or spaces for individuals
to gather or rest. The M-PUD district is intended to encourage a high-quality built environment
which includes distinctive architecture and public gathering spaces, and reflects innovation in the
placement and orientation of buildings and other structures. Non-residential uses must be
developed concurrently with residential uses in order to ensure a project with a variety of land
uses.
SECTION 14B.02 ELIGIBLE PROPERTY AND PROCEDURES
A Mixed Use Planned Unit Development zoning district shall be reviewed pursuant to this Chapter
and the procedures of Chapter 22. In order to be eligible for rezoning, an M-PUD shall meet the
following minimum qualifying conditions:
(a) Location: Land proposed for an M-PUD may only be located in an area planned for MPUDs
in the adopted Alpine Township Master Plan.
(b) Minimum Size: Land proposed for rezoning to M-PUD shall have an area of at least ten
acres, unless waived by the Planning Commission and Township Board based on criteria
set forth in this chapter.
(c) Utilities: An M-PUD shall be served by public water and public sanitary sewer services.
(d) Unified Control: The M-PUD shall be under unified ownership or control such that there is
one person, group of persons, or legal entity that would have responsibility for the design,
construction, and completion of the M-PUD in compliance with this Chapter.
(e) Recognizable Benefits: The M-PUD shall result in recognizable and substantial benefits
to the users of the M-PUD and to the Township, such as:

f) Off-Street Parking
When determining the baseline vehicular parking requirements for a C-PUD site, the
Planning Commission shall consider the requirements found for the particular use(s) in
Chapter XIX herein. The Planning Commission may modify the static parking
requirements of Chapter XIX based on the following criteria:
1) The nature and intensity of use(s) proposed for the site
2) The location and arrangement of all buildings
3) The type, number and size of all buildings
4) Market data submitted by the developer or found in generally accepted professional
reference manuals.
Where deemed feasible by the Planning Commission, no more than 60% of the site’s
off-street parking shall be located between the front façade and the corresponding
primary street frontage. Parking areas should be placed at the side and rear of
buildings wherever possible to allow the building’s architecture and onsite landscaping
to be the predominate view from the street. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
g) SIGNS
Building, pylon, and directional signs within a C-PUD shall comply with the regulations
for the proposed uses contained in Chapter XX of the Alpine Township Zoning
Ordinance.
The Planning Commission may modify the regulations of Chapter XX if the alterations
would still result in achieving the objectives of this Chapter. The Planning Commission
in its discretion may modify the size, height, area, placement, type and number of signs
within a C-PUD. In considering modifications, the Planning Commission shall find that
the signage plan as approved will not result in traffic or other transportation safety
hazards, will not result in visual blight, and will otherwise not result in a detriment to the
public health, safety or welfare.
The developer must submit a separate signage plan at the time of Preliminary
Development Plan review by the Planning Commission. The plan must clearly identify
where the proposed signage exceeds or deviates from the standards of Chapter XX of
the Alpine Township Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)

h) LANDSCAPING
A separate landscaping plan shall be submitted at the time of Preliminary Development
Plan review. The landscaping plan shall illustrate the type, size, location and number of
all proposed plantings. The landscaping proposal must substantially comply with the
requirements of the current Alpine Township landscaping policy and/or zoning
ordinance.
Landscaping plans should incorporate a “tree-lined street” design along all roadways
and service drives. Evergreen tree plantings should be used to screen dumpsters,
utility meters and ground HVAC units as appropriate. Evergreen shrub plantings should
be used to shield parking areas from the street.
The overall goal of the landscaping plan is not to overload a site with plantings but to
complement the built environment of the site. The color, texture and placement of
plantings is, therefore, very important. The use of a registered landscape architect is
encouraged in order to create a complementary landscaping plan.
All landscaped areas must be irrigated by a professionally-designed underground
watering system. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
(i) ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND TRAFFIC CALMING
Driveways, service drives, public and private roads and cross access connections must
be shown on the Final Development Plan in accordance with the current Alpine
Township Master Plan and M-37 Access Management Plan
Driveways proposed onto public roads must receive preliminary approval from the
appropriate permitting agency prior to Planning Commission review of the Final
Development Plan.
In order to protect pedestrians and non-motorized transportation users, the Plan must
display appropriately placed and designed traffic calming devices and strategies.
Examples of traffic calming measures include speed bumps, bump outs, chicanes, bulb
out midblock or intersection, traffic circles or roundabouts.
(j) STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A Stormwater management plan must be submitted along with the C-PUD site
plan proposal. The Township Engineer will review the Stormwater management
plan in accordance with the standards and procedures of the current Alpine
Township Stormwater Ordinance. (Gen. Ord. 01-06)

14D.01-14D.04 B-PUD
SECTION 14D.04 DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
(a) Minimum Lot Size Any site zoned for B-PUD shall not be less than five acres in
size. This requirement may be waived by the Planning Commission when the
site under consideration can be shown to meet the intent and objectives of this
Chapter.
(b) Lot Width and Setbacks The lot width, building setbacks and public or private
road frontage requirements shall be determined by the Planning Commission in its
review of the B-PUD site plan. The required front building setback for projects with
frontage on Alpine Avenue shall be a minimum of 75 feet from the M-37 right-of-way
line, but can be altered by the Planning Commission for a good cause shown based on
specific findings of fact. When determining these requirements, the Planning
Commission shall analyze:
1) The nature of existing and planned land uses adjacent to and near the site
2) Compatibility of all building setbacks with adjacent land uses
3) The location of natural features on the site
4) Existing and proposed site topography
5) The location of public utilities
6) Public safety and emergency vehicle access
7) The design of the planned service drive – cross access system
8) The design of existing and proposed pedestrian walkways
9) The objectives of the C-PUD district contained herein. (Ord. 04-03;5/7/04)
(c) Private Roads Private roads may be permitted within an B-PUD Zone when
specifically approved by the Planning Commission. The private road shall
adhere to the private road requirements of this Ordinance except that the road
shall be built to the minimum construction standards required by the Kent County
Road Commission for industrial roads. The requirements for private roads other
than road construction standards however, may be modified by the Planning
Commission according to the following criteria:
(1) Number and type of buildings served by the private road
(2) Amount of traffic generated by the proposed uses
(3) Existing topography and vegetation
(4) Security provisions
(5) The inter-relationship with the public street network
(6) The likelihood of public dedication of the roadway.
(d) Building Dimensions and Appearance. B-PUD developments shall be
designed with buildings that are architecturally compatible with each other and with
nearby structures.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14D - 2 B-PUD, Business PUD
14D.01-14D.04 B-PUD
1) All buildings (commercial and non-commercial) fronting on or visible from a public
street shall be designed consistent with the standards of Section 2.44.
2) All other buildings are required to have only the front façade finished primarily
with brick, textured or architectural block, glass, stone, concrete or stucco-like
material or a combination thereof. Aluminum, vinyl or wood sidings can be used
as building trim or accent features as allowed by the Planning Commission.
3) Industrial buildings shall not exceed 45 feet in height. All other buildings shall not
exceed 35 feet in height.
4) All business, service, production or processing shall be conducted entirely within
an enclosed building. All outdoor storage of material and machinery must be
completely screened from adjacent roadways and properties via an opaque
fence or landscaped berm. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
(e) PUBLIC SIDEWALKS :
Sidewalks and walkways shall be installed consistent with Section 2.45. (Ord. 04-03;
5/7/04)
(f) OFF STREET PARKING:
When determining the baseline vehicular parking requirements for a B-PUD site,
the Planning Commission shall consider the requirements found for the particular
use(s) in Chapter XIX herein. The Planning Commission may modify the static
parking requirements of Chapter XIX based on the following criteria:
1) The nature and intensity of use(s) proposed for the site
2) The location and arrangement of all buildings
3) The type, number and size of all buildings
4) Market data submitted by the developer or found in generally accepted professional
reference manuals.
Where deemed feasible by the Planning Commission, no more than 60% of the site’s
off-street parking shall be located between the front façade and the corresponding
primary street frontage. Parking areas should be placed at the side and rear of
buildings wherever possible to allow the building’s architecture and onsite landscaping
to be the predominate view from the street. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
5) SIGNS:
Building, pylon and directional signs within a B-PUD shall comply with the regulations
for the proposed uses contained in Chapter XX of the Alpine Township Zoning
Ordinance.
The Planning Commission may modify the regulations of Chapter XX if the alterations
would still result in achieving the objectives of this Chapter. The Planning Commission
in its discretion may modify the size, height, area, placement, type and number of signs
within a B-PUD. In considering modifications, the Planning Commission shall find that
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14D - 3 B-PUD, Business PUD
14D.01-14D.04 B-PUD
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14D - 4 B-PUD, Business PUD
the signage plan as approved will not result in traffic or other transportation safety
hazards, will not result in visual blight, and will otherwise not result in a detriment to the
public health, safety or welfare.
The developer must submit a separate signage plan at the time of Preliminary
Development Plan review by the Planning Commission. The plan must clearly identify
where the proposed signage exceeds or deviates from the standards of Chapter XX of
the Alpine Township Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
(h) LANDSCAPING:
A separate landscaping plan shall be submitted at the time of Preliminary Development Plan
review. The landscaping plan shall illustrate the type, size, location and number of all proposed
plantings. The landscaping proposal must substantially comply with the requirements of the
current Alpine Township landscaping policy and/or zoning ordinance.
Landscaping plans should incorporate a “tree-lined street” design along all roadways and
service drives. Evergreen tree plantings should be used to screen dumpsters, utility meters and
ground HVAC units as appropriate. Evergreen shrub plantings should be used to shield parking
areas from the street.
The overall goal of the landscaping plan is not to overload a site with plantings but to
complement the built environment of the site. The color, texture and placement of plantings is,
therefore, very important. The use of a registered landscape architect is encouraged in order to
create a complementary landscaping plan.
All landscaped areas must be irrigated by a professionally-designed underground watering
system. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
(i) ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND TRAFFIC CALMING:
Driveways, service drives, public and private roads and cross access connections must be
shown on the Final Development Plan in accordance with the current Alpine Township Master
Plan and M-37 Access Management Plan
Driveways proposed onto public roads must receive preliminary approval from the appropriate
permitting agency prior to Planning Commission review of the Final Development Plan.
In order to protect pedestrians and non-motorized transportation users, the Plan must display
appropriately placed and designed traffic calming devices and strategies. Examples of traffic
calming measures include speed bumps, bump outs, chicanes, bulb out midblock or
intersection, traffic circles or roundabouts. (Ord. 04-03; 5/7/04)
j) STORMWATER MANAGEMENT:
A stormwater management plan must be submitted along with the B-PUD site plan proposal.
The Township Engineer will review the stormwater management plan in accordance with the
standards and procedures of the current Alpine Township stormwater ordinance. (Ord. 04-03;
5/7/04)

RESIDENTIAL OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION – PUBLIC ACT NO. 177 OF 2001,
AS AMENDED - MCLA 125.286h et seq.
(Ord. No. 02-04; Effective 12-28-02)
(Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
SECTION 14E.01 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this Chapter are intended to carry out the provisions of Public
Act No. 177 of 2001, as amended, being MCLA 125.286h et seq. (“Act No. 177”). In
order for a landowner to exercise the open space preservation option of that statute, the
land involved must be rezoned to a planned unit development (“PUD”) zoning designation
pursuant to this Chapter and all of the requirements of this Chapter must be met.
Additionally, the PUD provisions of Chapter 22 of this Ordinance shall also apply except
to the extent that an express provision of this Chapter modifies the PUD process.
Act No. 177 requires that townships having a population of 1,800 or more and
which have a zoning ordinance must adopt provisions in their zoning ordinances known
as “open space preservation” provisions, which permit lands satisfying certain criteria to
be developed, at the option of the landowner, with the same number of dwellings on a
portion of the land specified in the zoning ordinance, but not more than 50%, that, as
determined by the townships could otherwise be developed under existing ordinances,
laws, and rules on the entire land area. The purpose of this Chapter is to adopt open
space preservation provisions consistent with the requirements of Act No. 177.
SECTION 14E.02 DEFINITIONS
For purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “Land zoned for residential development” shall mean any land located in the R-A
or R-1 zoning districts pursuant to this Ordinance.
(b) “Act No. 177” shall mean Public Act No. 177 of 2001, as amended, being
MCLA 125.286h et seq.
SECTION 14E.03 QUALIFYING CONDITIONS
(a) Land may be developed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter and Act
No. 177 only if all of the following requirements and conditions are met:
(1) The land is located in the R-A or R-1 zoning districts pursuant to this
Zoning Ordinance;
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14E - 1 Res. Open Space Preservation
14E.01 – 14E.12 ROSP
(2) The development of land pursuant to this Chapter shall not depend upon
the extension of a public sanitary sewer or a public water supply system to
the land, unless the development of the land without the exercise of the
clustering or open space option provided for by this Chapter would also
depend on such extension; and
(3) The clustering or open space option provided pursuant to this Chapter
shall not have previously been exercised with respect to the same land.
(b) If all of the preceding conditions and requirements listed in this Section are
satisfied, the land may be developed, at the option of the landowner, in
accordance with the provisions and requirements of this Chapter.
SECTION 14E.04 PERMITTED USES
(a) Only those residential land uses permitted by the zoning district in which the land
is located shall be permitted on land developed or used pursuant to the provisions
of this Chapter.
(b) Any On-Site Use Wind Energy System, including Structure-Mounted Wind
Energy Systems, which is 65 feet or less in total height subject to Section
2.46 herein. (Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
(c) Any Wind Energy System, including Structure-Mounted Wind Energy
Systems, which is greater than 65 feet in total height and Anemometer
(MET)Towers subject to Section 21.09 herein and when specifically

Planning Commission. (Ord. No. 09-01; 3/31/09)
SECTION 14E.05 PROCESS
Only land located in the R-A and R-1 zoning districts is eligible for the open space
preservation option provided for in this Chapter and pursuant to Act No. 177. Should the
owner of a property within the R-A or R-1 zoning districts desire to take advantage of
such option, the landowner must apply for a PUD rezoning approval pursuant to the
procedural requirements of Chapter 22 of this Zoning Ordinance. Once the land is zoned
for a PUD pursuant to this Chapter, it will be deemed a “Residential-Open Space
Preservation PUD.” All of the normal minimum lot size, setback, road frontage, lot width,
width-to-depth ratio, and other dimensional, frontage, and area requirements governing
the development of land within the zoning district where the land is located shall apply
except to the extent that such standards are expressly varied pursuant to this Chapter or
where the Planning Commission and Township Board approve such a variation pursuant
to the PUD approval process.

(G) If the development is to be served by public streets, proof that the
Kent County Road Commission has granted preliminary approval
of the design, layout and construction of the streets.
(H) If any portion of the land has frontage on a lake, river, or stream,
the site development plan shall show the proposed location and
number of dwelling units with proposed frontage on or access to a
body of water.
(I) The location, construction and design of any proposed private
street(s).
(J) The site development plan shall demonstrate that each of the
proposed residential lots and proposed building envelopes is
“buildable” and fully suited for the construction and use of a singlefamily
residential dwelling.
(3) Developable Area. When reviewing an application submitted under the
terms of this Chapter, the Planning Commission shall determine whether
the Existing Zoning Yield Plan accurately reflects the number and location
of dwelling units that could be developed on the land under its existing
zoning if the clustering or open space option provided by this Chapter
were not exercised.
If the Planning Commission determines that the number and/or location of
dwellings shown on the Existing Zoning Yield Plan exceeds the number of
dwellings that could be permitted or developed on the land if it were
developed under its existing zoning if the clustering or open space option
provided by this Chapter were not exercised (or the locations are not
accurate), the applicant shall submit a revised Existing Zoning Yield Plan
which accurately reflects the number and location of dwellings which could
have been developed under existing zoning if the Act No. 177 option were
not exercised pursuant to this Chapter. For purposes of determining the
number and location of dwellings that would have been permitted or
developed on the land under its existing zoning if the clustering or open
space option were not exercised, the following shall be deemed land not
developable and shall be excluded from the formula of determining
otherwise developable land area under existing ordinances:
(A) Wetlands as defined by Michigan law.
(B) Land located under a lake, pond, river, or stream.

flooding.
(4) The Restrictions Document. The applicant shall submit a copy of the
proposed deed restrictions, restrictive covenants, conservation easement,
plat dedication, or other legal document which the applicant proposes to
utilize if the proposed open space or cluster development is approved
pursuant to this Chapter and which would have the legal effect of
preserving in perpetuity the open space required by this Chapter in an
undeveloped state. Such document shall be reviewed and approved by
the Township and the Township Attorney (as to form and content) prior to
recording. At a minimum, the document(s) shall provide for all of the
following:
(A) Indicate the proposed permitted use(s) of the undeveloped open
space.
(B) Require that the open space be maintained forever in an
undeveloped condition, without buildings, structures, or other
improvements, except such drainage improvements, utilities, riding
trails, hiking trails, picnic areas, park or playground equipment,
growing of crops, agricultural structures, or similar improvements
which are approved by the Planning Commission.
(C) Require that the undeveloped open space be maintained by the
parties who have an ownership interest in it.
(D) Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the undeveloped
open space, including necessary pruning and harvesting of trees
and new plantings.
(E) Provide language explicitly stating that the Township may specially
assess those parties having an ownership interest in the open
spaces for the purposes of maintenance and upkeep in
accordance with original Township approvals if maintenance is not
undertaken in a reasonable time period and manner.
The approved restrictions document shall be fully executed by all of the
owner(s) of the land and shall be recorded with the Kent County Register
of Deeds before any lots are sold and before any building permits are
issued.

SECTION 14E.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR OPEN SPACE
(a) Required Open Space. At least 50%, but no more than 80%, of the land
proposed for development under the provisions of this Chapter shall remain in a
perpetually undeveloped state (i.e., “open space”) by means of a conservation
easement, plat dedication, restrictive covenant, or other legal instrument that runs
with the land as approved by the Township Board (upon recommendation by the
Planning Commission) and the Township Attorney.
(b) Lands to be Set Aside as Open Space. It shall be the Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission) that determines which 50% or
more of the land shall be set aside for open space, as well as which portion or
portions of the land may be developed. At the discretion of the Township Board
(upon recommendation from the Planning Commission), the land to be set aside
as permanent open space need not be contiguous. The Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission) shall also determine what
percentage of the total land area (between 50% and 80%) shall be set aside as
permanent open space.
(c) The following areas shall not constitute open space and may not be utilized to
satisfy the open space requirement:
(1) Any areas located within or under any public street easement or right-ofway.
(2) Property located under or within any private street or road easement.
(3) The land located under or the area within any easement for overhead
utility lines.

(1) The open space shall not include a golf course.
(2) The open space may include a recreational trail, picnic area, children’s
play area, greenway, linear park, an agricultural use or other use which, as
determined by the Planning Commission, is substantially similar to these
uses.
(3) The open space shall be available for all residents of the development,
subject to reasonable rules and regulations. The open space may be, but
is not required to be, dedicated to the use of the public.
(4) If the land contains a lake, stream or other body of water, the Planning
Commission may require that a portion of the open space abut the body of
water.
(5) A portion of the open space shall be located along the public street
frontage abutting the land. The depth of this area shall be at least 75 feet,
not including public right-of-way, and this area shall be left in its natural

However, the Township Board (upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission), at its discretion, may permit structures or improvements to be
located in the open space if the structures and/or improvements would be
consistent with the designated purpose of the open space. By way of example
only, park or playground equipment could be permitted on open space designated
for recreational use, or agricultural structures could be permitted on open space
designated for agricultural use.
SECTION 14E.08 INDIVIDUAL LOTS, STREETS, AND OTHER
IMPROVEMENTS; MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
(a) Underlying Zoning District. The development of land under this Chapter shall
comply with all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to the zoning district in

14E.01 – 14E.12 ROSP
which the land is located, except those setback, area, lot width to depth ratio, and
yard size requirements that must be adjusted to allow the clustering option
permitted under this Chapter where approved by the Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission).
(b) Uniform Lot Size. Lots for dwellings in the clustered portion of the development
shall be as uniform in area as is reasonably practicable, unless otherwise
approved by the Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission).
(c) Building Envelopes. The location and area of building envelopes, as proposed by
the applicant, shall be subject to the review and approval of the Township Board
(upon recommendation from the Planning Commission). The location and area of
building envelopes shall be established to achieve the intent and purpose of the
zoning district in which the land is located.
(d) Required Street Frontage. Each lot shall have a minimum of at least 60 feet of
frontage on a lawful street, measured at the street right-of-way line.
(e) Lot Width. Each lot shall have a minimum lot width of 65 feet, measured at the
front setback line of the underlying zoning district in which the land is located.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, each lot which abuts or has
frontage on a lake, river, stream or creek shall have frontage on such body of
water equal to or greater than the minimum lot width requirement for the zoning
district in which the land is located.
(f) Maximum Number of Lots. The clustered portion of the development shall
contain no more than the maximum number of lots, as determined from the
Existing Zoning Yield Plan approved by the Planning Commission and Township
Board.
(g) Nondwelling Unit Structures. Lots containing nondwelling structures such as a
clubhouse and its related amenities, shall be subject to all requirements of this
Chapter applicable to lots containing dwellings and shall further be subject to all
other requirements of this Ordinance and other Township ordinances applicable
to the type of structure proposed. However, the Township Board (upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission) may, at its discretion, permit the
enlargement of a lot containing a nondwelling structure so as to reasonably
accommodate it.
(h) Perimeter Lots. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, the
Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission) may
require that the clustered development be designed and constructed with lot sizes
and setbacks on the perimeter that will be reasonably consistent with the lot sizes
and setbacks of either planned or existing adjacent uses.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 14E - 9 Res. Open Space Preservation
14E.01 – 14E.12 ROSP
(i) Sidewalks. The Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission) may require sidewalks as deemed reasonable throughout the
development.
(j) Grading. Grading within the clustered development shall comply with the
following requirements:
(1) To preserve the natural appearance of the land, all graded areas, cuts and
fills shall be kept to a minimum. Specific requirements may be placed by
the Township Board on the area of land to be graded or to be used for
building, and on the size, height, and angles of cut-and-fill slopes and the
shape thereof. Retaining walls may be required by the Township Board.
(2) All areas indicated as open space on the approved development plan shall
be undisturbed by grading, excavating, structures or otherwise, except as
permitted by the Township Board (upon recommendation from the
Planning Commission). Drainage improvements, utility lines, riding trails,
hiking trails, picnic areas, and similar recreational improvements and
amenities may be placed in open space areas if approved by the
Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission).
(3) Grading within the clustered development shall be planned and carried out
so as to avoid erosion, pollution, flooding or other adverse effects upon the
land, and so as to have only such minimal effect upon lakes, streams,
wetlands, and the environmental characteristics of the land as may be
reasonably feasible.
(k) Private Streets. Private streets within a clustered development shall conform to
the private street requirements found in Section 2.34 of this Ordinance. The
Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission) may,
however, modify the requirements for private streets and in doing so, shall
consider the following criteria:
(1) The number and type of dwelling units served by the private street;

SECTION 18.06 STANDARDS.
(a) GENERAL STANDARDS. The Site Plan Review Committee or Planning Commission
shall review the site plan for compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and
conformance with the following general standards:
(1) All elements of the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently organized in
relation to topography, the size and type of the lot, the character of adjoining
property, and the type and size of buildings. The site shall be so developed as not
to impede the normal and orderly development or improvement of surrounding
property for uses permitted in this Ordinance.
(2) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practical, by
minimizing tree and soil removal, and by topographic modifications which result in
maximum harmony with adjacent areas.
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 5 Site Plan Review
(3) Special attention shall be given to proper site drainage so that removal of storm
waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties.
(4) The site plan shall provide reasonable, visual, and sound privacy for all dwelling
units located therein. Fences, walks, barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as
appropriate, for the protection and enhancement of property and for the privacy of
its occupants.
(5) All buildings or groups of buildings shall be so arranged as to permit emergency
vehicle access by some practical means as required by the Township Fire
Department.
(6) Every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public street, walkway, or
other area dedicated to common use.
(7) There shall be provided a pedestrian circulation system which is insulated as
completely as reasonably possible from the vehicular circulation system.
(8) All loading and unloading areas and outside storage areas including areas for the
storage of trash, which face or are visible from residential districts or public
thoroughfares, shall be screened by a vertical screen consisting of structural or
plant materials no less than six (6) feet in height.
(9) Exterior lighting shall be arranged so that it is deflected away from adjacent
properties and so that it does not impede the vision of traffic along adjacent streets.
(10) With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior
drives, and parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of
access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, particularly the avoidance of building corners next to access drives, and
arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient, and insofar as
practicable, do not detract from the design of the proposed buildings and structures
and the neighboring properties. Streets and drives which are part of an existing or
planned street pattern which serve adjacent development shall be of a width
appropriate to the traffic volume they will carry and shall have a dedicated right-ofway
equal to that specified in the Alpine Township Master Plan.
(11) All streets shall be built in accordance with the requirements of the Alpine
Township Subdivision Ordinance and the specifications of the Kent County Road
Commission.
(12) Site plans shall conform to all applicable requirements of state and federal
statutes and approval may be conditioned on the applicant receiving necessary
state and Federal permits before final site plan approval or an occupancy permit
is granted.
(13) The Commission or Committee shall review the proposed landscaping for
conformance to the Alpine Township Landscape Guidelines.
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 6 Site Plan Review
(b) ACCESS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
The Planning Commission, the Site Plan Review Committee and staff shall review site
plans according to the access management standards contained in this section relating to
vehicle access and circulation. The standards contained in this Section are intended to
balance the right of property owners to reasonably use their property with the need to
enhance vehicular safety and ingress-egress on public roadways. It is the judgment of
the Township that the adoption and implementation of these standards is in the best
interest of the Township in order to increase traffic safety, lessen congestion, provide safe
and adequate access, promote community character, enhance the value of property and
ensure orderly and inter-connected development.
The Township, in conjunction with other governmental agencies with appropriate
jurisdiction, may require service drives for contiguous parcels along Alpine Avenue and
on other streets. The Township may also limit the number of driveways for a site, to
require that parking lots on contiguous parcels be shared, and that opposite driveways be
directly aligned, all as required by the particular circumstances of a development project.
Temporary direct access to M-37 may be granted in instances where access roads or
adjoining parcels are not yet developed. A temporary driveway permit shall specify the
future means of access, location (if known), and date the change will be made. Any
temporary access agreement must first be approved by Alpine Township and the
permitting agency and recorded with the County Register of Deeds.
While a parcel shall not be denied reasonable access to M-37 or other public streets, the
public good shall be considered and public safety addressed via the application of the
access management standards contained in this Section and cooperation between Alpine
Township, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), and the Kent County
Road Commission and the developer.
These access management standards do not seek to supplant the permitting authority of
MDOT and the Kent County Road Commission. Rather, these standards have been
developed in partnership with MDOT and the Kent County Road Commission to facilitate
vehicular movement and safety within the context of inter-governmental cooperation
during the site plan review process.
(1) Access Management Plan Maps
Maps 1 – 7 (found at the end of this chapter) graphically display the access
management standards applicable by the Township during site plan review. It shall
be the responsibility of the Alpine Township Planning Commission, Site Plan
Review Committee and staff to implement the access management standards
shown on Maps 1-7 consistent with the terms of this Ordinance.
Figures A, B and C (found at the end of this chapter) provide conceptual references
for designing service drives, parking lot cross access and rear service drives.
In its review of future public road and access point needs as shown on Maps
1 – 7, the relevant Township body or individual shall examine the zoning
designations, master planning considerations, pre-existing and proposed
land uses for the specific site and vicinity. The goal of any review shall be
to facilitate an interconnected, safe and efficient public road network.
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 7 Site Plan Review
Recommendations and requirements of Kent County Road Commission and
MDOT shall be gathered as part of the public road planning and development
process.
In situations where Maps 1 - 7 do not identify specific access management
requirements for a particular parcel, the Township shall, in consultation with MDOT
and the Kent County Road Commission, develop and implement such standards,
relying on MDOT access management methodology.
In determining such access management methods and requirements, the following
criteria shall be considered:
? The type and location of existing and proposed uses on the site
? The location and design of existing and proposed parking areas
? The existing and projected traffic volume on adjacent roadways
? Compatibility between adjacent land uses
? Land ownership and location of lot lines
? The general area recommendations of Maps 1 - 7
? Topography and sight distance along adjacent roadways and onsite
? Location of median crossings on Alpine Avenue
? Distance from intersections
? Location of driveways opposite the site
? Width of roadway and number of lanes.
? Such other factors as deemed appropriate by the relevant Township body or
individual
Subject to the provisions of this section, the Planning Commission or its
Committee, upon the recommendation of the Planning Director, shall have the
power to waive or alter the provisions of this section where all of the following
conditions are found to exist:
(i) There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property which impacts access to or from the property.
Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions include:
(A) Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or the shape of a specific
piece of property on the effective date of this ordinance
amendment; or
(B) Exceptional topographic, environmental or similar conditions or
situations; or
(C) Those created by reason of the use, development or legal
restrictions on the property or immediately adjoining property.
(ii) The waiver or alteration will not be detrimental to adjacent properties or the
surrounding neighborhood.
(iii) The waiver or alteration will not adversely impact the intent and purpose of
the overall access management plan.
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 8 Site Plan Review
(2) Service Drives
Service drives shall be constructed according to the following requirements:
(i) A service drive shall have a minimum width of 24 feet and be constructed
to Kent County Road Commission standards for base and thickness of
asphalt.
(ii) A minimum of 10 feet snow storage/landscaping area must be reserved
along both sides of the service drive with the edge of the service drive
located a minimum of 10 feet from the road right-of-way.
(iii) All driveway radii shall be concrete curbs.
(iv) The entrance of the service drive from a public road other than Alpine
Avenue shall be at least 200 feet measured from the tangent point of the
driveway radius along the public road to the tangent point of the public
street radius along Alpine Avenue to provide for adequate stacking and
maneuvering. The Planning Commission or Committee shall have the
authority to waive or modify the aforementioned spacing requirements
when strict adherence to them would result in unreasonable access to a
site.
(v) The service drive shall be a private road maintained by adjoining property
owners or user who shall enter into a formal agreement together for the
joint maintenance of the service drive. This agreement shall first be
reviewed and approved by the Township. This agreement shall then be
recorded with the Kent County Register of Deeds and shall be binding upon
all future property owners.
(vi) Landscaping along the service drive shall be determined by the Planning
Commission or its Committee during site plan review. Installation and
maintenance of landscaping shall be the responsibility of each lot owner or
user.
(3) Driveways
All driveways proposed onto Alpine Avenue/M-37 and other public streets must be
permitted by MDOT and/or the Kent County Road Commission.
A right turn lane and taper shall be required for driveways in accordance with
MDOT and/or the Kent County Road Commission.
(4) Traffic Studies
The Township may commission a traffic study for a project as part of the site plan
review process. The purpose of such a study is to review the access management
plan’s requirements and to test the plan for ongoing viability with respect to a
particular development. The traffic study shall be funded by the developer and
conducted by a firm with traffic planning expertise chosen by the Township. The
results of the study shall be shared with the Planning Commission, MDOT and the
Kent County Road Commission for comparison purposes and to support site plan
review decisions.
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 9 Site Plan Review
The level of detail required in a traffic study shall be based upon the expected
amount of traffic to be generated by the proposed use, based on generally
accepted traffic engineering sources such as the Michigan handbook, “Evaluating
Traffic Impact Studies”, and the “ITE Trip Generation” sourcebook.
(i) Traffic Impact Assessment: A Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) shall be
required for projects expected to generate either between 50-99 directional
trips during peak hour traffic or 500-750 directional trips during a typical
day. The TIA shall evaluate current and future inbound and outbound traffic
operations at site access points and shall support and describe proposed
access design and other mitigation measures that will positively affect
traffic operations at these points.
(ii) Traffic Impact Study: A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required for
projects expected to generate either 100 or more directional trips in the
peak hour or over 750 trips on an average day. The TIS shall evaluate
current, background and future traffic operations at site access points and
major signalized or non-signalized intersections in proximity to the site.
The TIS must also describe and support proposed access design and other
mitigation measures that will positively affect traffic operations at the site
and nearby intersections. The TIS shall also evaluate pedestrian access,
circulation and safety. The TIS must take into account the Alpine Township
Master Plan in analyzing future traffic developments.

Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 15 Site Plan Review
SECTION 18.07 CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
(a) The Committee or Planning Commission may condition approval of a site plan on
conformance with the standards of another local, county, state, or federal agency. It may
do so when such conditions:
(1) Would ensure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or
activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads
caused by the land use or activity.
(2) Would protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and
energy.
(3) Would ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land.
(4) Would promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner.
(b) The Committee or Planning Commission may conditionally approve a site plan upon
conformance with fencing, screening, buffering, or landscaping proposals of the Alpine
Township Landscape Guidelines and may collect a performance guarantee consistent
with the requirements of Section 18.08 herein to ensure conformance. When so doing,
the following finding shall be made and documented as part of the review process:
(1) That such fencing, screening, buffering, or landscaping would mitigate negative
effects of noise, dust, lighting, vehicular or pedestrian traffic, loading or unloading,
parking, or other similar impact on adjoining parcels.
(2) That absent such conditions, the development would adversely affect the
reasonable use, enjoyment, and value of adjoining lands in light of similar benefits
enjoyed by other properties in the area.
SECTION 18.08 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
The Committee or Planning Commission may require a performance bond, letter of credit, or
certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of road, lighting, utility, sidewalk,
landscaping, drainage, and other required improvements associated with the project. The
estimated amount shall be determined by the applicant. Such performance guarantee shall be
deposited with the Clerk of the Township at the time of the issuance of the permit authorizing the
activity or project to ensure faithful completion of the improvements indicated with the approved

18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 17 Site Plan Review
SECTION 18.12 EXPANSION OF EXISTING USE, STRUCTURE or BUILDING. (Ord. No. 93-6;
8/5/93)
It is recognized that there are existing land uses, buildings, and structures which do not conform
to the current regulations of this Ordinance and as such do not achieve the intended purposes of
this Ordinance. When these uses, buildings, and structures are expanded, enlarged or increased
in intensity so that a site plan review is required per Section 18.02 herein, the following regulations
shall apply.
(a) The Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee shall require that the site
development standards used in reviewing site plans be applied to existing uses, structures
or buildings. Those standards shall be applied if it is determined that any of the following
situations exist:
(1) Existing stormwater drainage provisions on site are inadequate.
(2) There is insufficient on-site parking to satisfy current Zoning Ordinance
requirements and/or a hard surface parking area is needed to reduce dust and
reduce gravel and dirt runoff into the public stormwater drainage system.
(3) Existing driveways may result in hazardous vehicle movements.
(4) Additional plantings are needed in order to comply with the intent of the Alpine
Township Landscape Guidelines or replace trees and shrubs previously removed
and screening is needed in the form of fencing or landscaping to provide a buffer
between uses, particularly to screen materials stored outside.
(5) Access to adjoining properties is inadequate and can be improved by way of
parking lot connections or installation of a service drive to improve traffic circulation
and reduce the number of turning movements onto the public street system.
(6) Safety for pedestrians can be improved and better emergency vehicle access can
be provided.
(7) Better lighting conditions are needed to reduce or eliminate nuisance lighting
situations for drivers and nearby residents.
(8) Screening of dumpsters is needed to improve the appearance of a site and reduce
the likelihood of windblown trash.
(9) Sidewalks are needed to improve pedestrian safety. (The criteria of Section 11.04
(g) herein shall be considered in addition to the criteria of this Section.)
(b) In determining how to apply the site plan review standards to address the above
deficiencies found on a site, the Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee
shall be guided by the following criteria:
(1) Whether or not compliance would ensure safer on site conditions, protect the
natural environment, improve traffic circulation, achieve compatibility with adjacent
land uses, promote the use of the land in a socially and economically desirable
manner and generally accomplish the purposes of site plan review as described in
18.01 – 18.13 Site Plan Review
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 18 - 18 Site Plan Review
this chapter.
(2) The practicality of requiring compliance with the applicable regulations of this
Ordinance based on the existing design, layout, and operation of the existing use
and size of the site.
(3) Whether or not requiring compliance would have a negative impact on the
character, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood or surrounding area.
SECTION 18.13 VALIDITY OF FINAL SITE PLANS
Approval of the final site plan is valid for a period of not longer than one year unless extended as
allowed herein. The one-year period shall commence on the date when the site plan is signed
for approval by the chairperson of the Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee as
the case may be. If actual physical construction of a substantial nature of the improvements
included in the approved site plan has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward
completion during that period, the approval of the final site plan shall be terminated.
Upon written application, filed prior to the termination of the one year review period, the Planning
Commission or Site Plan Review Committee, whichever granted final site plan approval, may
authorize a single extension of the time limit for approval of a final site plan for a further period of
not more than one year. Such extension shall only be granted based on evidence from the
applicant that there is a likelihood of construction commencing within the one-year extension.

CHAPTER XIX
OFFSTREET PARKING AND LOADING
(Ord. No. 95-8; 11/2/95)
(Ord. No. 00-06; 9/1/00)
(Ord. No 14-04; 10/20/14)
SECTION 19.01 PURPOSE
The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe regulations for off-street parking of motor
vehicles in residential and non-residential zoning districts, to ensure by the provision of
these regulations that adequate parking and access is provided in a safe and
convenient manner, and to afford reasonable protection to adjacent land uses from light,
noise, air pollution, and other affects of parking areas.
SECTION 19.02 SCOPE
(a) At the time any building or structure is erected, enlarged, or increased in
capacity, or uses established, off-street parking and loading spaces shall be
provided in all zoning districts according to the requirements of this Chapter.
(b) No parking or loading area or space which exists at the time of the adoption of
this Ordinance shall thereafter be relinquished or reduced in any manner below
the requirements established by this Ordinance.
(c) Parking areas must have the same zoning classification as the property on which
the principal use is located which they are serving.
SECTION 19.03 LOCATION OF PARKING AREAS
(a) For all residential uses the number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance
shall be located on the same lot or parcel as the dwelling units served.
(b) For all other uses the number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance shall
be located on the same lot, or lots under the same ownership, within 300 feet of
the building it is intended to serve, measured from the building to the nearest
parking space of the on-premise parking lot.
Parking on lots under different ownership within 300 feet of the building it is
intended to serve shall also be permitted, if such arrangement does not result in
a parking deficiency for the other use, and a legal agreement specifying the
terms for the parking arrangement, signed by all involved parties is provided.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 19 - 1 Parking and Loading
19.01 - 19.10 Parking
SECTION 19.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
(a) Units of Measurement
(1) Where benches, pews, or other similar seating are used as seats, each 24
inches of such seating facility shall be counted as one seat.
(2) For requirements stated in terms of employees, the calculation shall be
based upon the maximum number of employees likely to be on the
premises during the largest shift.
(3) When units of measurement determining the number of required parking
spaces or loading spaces result in a requirement of a fractional space, that
fraction shall be counted as a full parking space.
(b) Shared Parking and Mixed Occupancy
(1) In the case of mixed uses in the same building or on the same lot or
parcel, the total requirements for off-street parking and loading shall be
the sum of the requirements for the individual uses computed separately.
(2) Joint or collective provision of off-street parking areas for buildings or uses
on two or more properties shall not be less than the sum of the
requirements for the participating individual uses computed separately
except that the Planning Commission may approve a lesser parking
requirement for such uses provided that all of the following requirements
are met:
(i) The uses proposing to combine parking requirements shall have
hours of operation which do not coincide.
(ii) Evidence of a signed agreement between the owners of both
properties agreeing to such joint use shall be provided to the
Planning Commission.
(iii) Sufficient area shall be available such that the required parking for
both uses computed separately may be provided on each lot or
parcel involved in the event that one party to the joint parking
agreement abrogates or otherwise withdraws from such agreement.
Should such agreement be withdrawn by either party each use
shall provide the parking as herein required.
(c) Storage and Repair
The use of semi-trailers for storage purposes for more than one week within a
parking area is prohibited.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 19 - 2 Parking and Loading
19.01 - 19.10 Parking
(d) Parking Requirements for Uses Not Listed
The minimum parking space requirements for all uses shall be as listed in
Section 19.07. For uses not specifically listed in Section 19.07 the requirements
shall be determined as follows.
(1) The Zoning Administrator may establish the parking requirement by
making the determination that the proposed use is similar in parking
requirement to a use which is listed in Section 19.07. In such case, the
same parking requirement shall apply.
(2) If the proposed use is not similar to a use listed in Section 19.07, the
Zoning Administrator shall refer to engineering or planning manuals,
publications and reports, or to the parking requirements used by other
municipalities in order to determine the minimum parking requirements.
(e) Maximum Amount of Parking
In order to minimize excess areas of pavement which result in adverse aesthetic
impacts and contribute to high rates of storm-water runoff, parking lots exceeding
the minimum parking space requirements by greater than 20 percent shall be
prohibited, unless the applicant can demonstrate that additional parking is
necessary to the operation of the proposed use. Factors to be considered in
such demonstration shall include but need not be limited to the type of use
proposed, examples of similar uses requiring such additional parking and
whether such additional parking is for seasonal or peak periods only.
(f) Conformance to Parking Plan
Once a parking area has been approved as part of an approved site plan the
owners, operators, or tenants shall conform at all times to the requirements of the
approved plan including maintaining the parking lot in good working order and
appearance.
(g) Existing Parking Lots
Parking areas which are in existence as of the date of adoption of this chapter
shall be considered legal non-conforming uses if lawfully approved under the
previous regulations. Any expansion of such existing parking areas shall
conform to the requirements of this Chapter.
(h) Selling of Vehicles in Parking Lots.
In Commercial, Office and Industrial zoning districts the parking storage or
display of vehicles for sale is prohibited within the front yard of any off street
parking area unless the vehicle is being offered for sale by the owner or operator
of the property or business or unless such use is otherwise permitted under the
terms of this Ordinance.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 19 - 3 Parking and Loading
19.01 - 19.10 Parking
SECTION 19.05 DESIGN, LOCATION, AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
The following regulations shall apply to all uses except one and two family dwellings
and farm uses.
(a) Parking Lot Surface and Drainage
All drives, driveways, and parking spaces shall be surfaced with asphalt,
bituminous, portland cement binder pavement or gravel surface tested in such a
manner so as to provide a durable and dustless surface. Such surfaces shall be
graded and drained to dispose of all surface water and prevent drainage onto
abutting properties.
In order to reduce the amount of impervious surface and the corresponding storm
water runoff as well as improve parking lot aesthetics, the Planning Commission
or Site Plan Review Committee as the case may be may approve alternate
parking lot surfaces for overflow parking or employee parking. Such alternate
parking lot surfaces may include but not be limited to gravel, crushed stone, or
products which are installed in the ground to support a vehicle but allow grass to
grow within the supporting spaces.
(b) Striping
All parking spaces shall be striped with paint or a material approved by the
Zoning Administrator. Striping shall be at least four inches in width. The striping
shall be maintained at all times. For parking lots approved without a paintable
surface, the method of marking parking spaces shall be approved by the
Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee whichever is responsible
for approving the parking site plan.
(c) Lighting
Lighting fixtures used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be so arranged
as to deflect the light away from any adjoining residential properties or streets
and highways. Lighting fixtures in required parking facilities for commercial,
industrial, or office districts within 150 feet of any residential area shall not
exceed 20 feet in height. All other fixtures shall not exceed 35 feet in height.
Light fixtures shall be designed to achieve total luminary cutoff (See Chapter 18,
Figure 1).
(d) Bumper Blocks
The parking lot shall be provided with wheel or bumper guards, or other
appropriate means, so that no part of a parked vehicle will extend beyond the
parking area onto a street right of way or adjacent property and to protect
landscaped areas.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 19 - 4 Parking and Loading
19.01 - 19.10 Parking
(e) Backing into Public Road
All off-street parking and loading areas that make it necessary for vehicles to
back directly into a public road are prohibited, provided that this prohibition shall
not apply to off-street parking areas serving residential dwellings with four or less
units.
(f) Parking Lot Setbacks
All off-street parking areas, except those serving residential dwellings with less
than four dwelling units, shall be set back a minimum of 5 feet from the rear and
side lot lines, and a minimum of 20 feet from the front lot line. The Planning
Commission or Site Plan Review Committee may permit parking aisles or vehicle
maneuvering areas to encroach within the parking setback where substantial
additional screening or landscaping acceptable to the Planning Commission is
provided. Such setback area shall be landscaped, except for necessary drives,
walk-ways, signs, utility or light poles, or similar structures.
(g) Parking areas shall be designed to delineate access aisles or drives and to
provide drivers proper sight distance at the end of parking rows where such rows
intersect access aisles or drive. This can be accomplished by traffic islands,
striped pavement or other methods approved by the Planning Commission.
Such islands shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide.
(h) Parking lots shall be designed to limit the number of points where pedestrians
must cross in front of vehicles. In particular, vehicle access in front of building
entrances and exits should be minimized. Landscaped pedestrian walkways to
and from parking areas may be required to enhance pedestrian safety.
(i) Snow shall not be stored in areas with plantings or where it may create visibility
problems for drivers or pedestrians.
(j) Parking areas wherever reasonably possible shall be placed at the side or rear of
buildings.

(g) Deferred Parking Construction
In order to avoid excessive amount of impervious surface, the Planning
Commission or Site Plan Review Committee may approve a development which
provides less than the minimum number of parking spaces required herein if the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that a
reduced amount of total parking space will meet the projected parking needs of
the project due to:
(1) The nature, size, density, location, or design of the proposed
development, including the design of the circulation and parking plan;
(2) The availability of vacant or otherwise undeveloped land on the same
parcel as shown on the proposed development plan, will remain available
to provide additional off-street parking space if additional parking space is
subsequently determined to be necessary by the Township Planning
Commission to meet the parking needs of the development;
(3) Characteristics of the development which will affect the parking needs,

owner or operator.

SECTION 20.15 BILLBOARDS (Ord. No. 95-2; 4/6/95) (Ord. No. 12-04; 9/17/12)
Billboards are, by their size and nature, different in scope, impact, and purpose from
other types of signage in the Township. Among other matters, billboards advertise or
communicate goods, services or messages not conducted, sold or generated on the lot
where the billboard is located. Billboards are significantly larger in size than other types
of stand alone signage allowed in the Township and their principal purpose is to attract
the attention of the traveling public and to divert that attention from the road. The
potential impact of a billboard on adjacent areas is significantly greater than other types
of signage. Moreover, the potential for distraction to motorists and pedestrians is
greater than for other signs. Recently, more businesses desire to utilize advancements
in technology which allow signs (including billboards) to change copy electronically (e.g.
utilizing an L.E.D. or digital type of sign). These newer technologies exacerbate the
potential negative impacts of a billboard in terms of dominating the environment in
which they operate due to light spillover and light pollution as well as creating additional
distractions for the traveling public. The intent of this section is to (i) establish size,
illumination, location and operation standards and regulations for billboards, and (ii)
prohibit billboards utilizing these newer technologies in order to minimize the secondary
effects that can accompany the display of these types of signs, preserve the character
and repose of adjacent areas, property values in all area of the Township, and reduce
traffic, pedestrian, and similar hazards caused by undue distractions.
Billboards are subject to all of the following regulations:
(a) Billboards are permitted only on lots located in the C-1, C-2, C-3, O-S, I-1 and I-2
zoning districts which have frontage on or touch a State of Michigan highway.
(b) A billboard which is established on a lot shall constitute the principal use of that
lot. Any other principal use allowed in that zoning district shall not be established
on the same lot as the billboard. No building shall be present on a lot with a
billboard thereon and no building shall be built on a lot with a billboard thereon.
(c) The lot upon which the billboard is to be placed shall conform to the minimum lot
area and width regulations of the zoning district in which the billboard is located.
(d) No more than one billboard shall be located on a lot.
(f) Each billboard shall be located not less than 1,000 feet from any other billboard.
regardless of municipal jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, the distance
between billboards on opposite sides of the State of Michigan highway shall be
measured as the distance between the points at which lines drawn perpendicular
to the State of Michigan highway from the location of each billboard intersect with
a line along the center of the highway.
(g) A billboard shall not exceed 300 square feet in area as measured per Section
20.10.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 20 - 25 Signs
Signs 20.01-20.17
(h) No billboard shall contain more than one sign panel facing the same direction of
traffic on the highway.
(i) The height of a billboard shall not exceed 35 feet above the preexisting grade at
the base of the support pole(s) as measured per Section 20.10.
(j) A billboard shall have a front setback of 20 feet from the front lot line and a side
and rear setback of 15 feet from side and rear lot lines. The setbacks for a
billboard shall be measured from the closest point or edge of the billboard.
(k) A billboard shall not be internally lit.
(l) Support structures, poles or braces may exceed 3 feet wide on any one side.
(m) Digital Billboards and Mechanical Billboards, as defined herein, are prohibited.
(n) Conversion of an existing static or other billboard to a Digital or Mechanical
Billboard in part or in whole is prohibited.
SECTION 20.16 REMOVAL OF SIGNS
(a) Signs on Public Property. Any sign installed or placed in the public right-of-way or
otherwise on public property, except in compliance with provisions of this
Chapter, shall be and subject to confiscation and may be immediately removed
by the Township. In addition to other available remedies, the Township shall
have the right to recover from the owner or person placing an unauthorized sign
the full costs of removal and disposal of the sign.
(b) Signs not in Conformance with Ordinance. Any sign and appurtenant structure
shall be removed by the owner within 72 hours of receipt of notice from the
Zoning Administrator or designee stating that the sign is unsafe, not properly
maintained, or otherwise does not comply with the requirements of this
Ordinance. Such notice shall also state that the sign will be removed unless the
unsafe or improper condition is corrected by the owner.
Upon failure to remove or correct the unsafe or improper condition within 72
hours of receipt of notice, the Zoning Administrator or designee may take
whatever action is necessary to have the sign and appurtenant structure
removed or to otherwise abate the unsafe or improper condition. In addition, the
Zoning Administrator or designee shall take whatever action is necessary to
recover from the owner of the sign the full costs of removing and disposing of the
sign or abating the unsafe or improper condition.
(c) Abandoned signs. Abandoned signs are not permitted and must be removed by
the owner of the lot on which the sign is located. If the owner does not remove
the sign, or if no owner can be found, the Township may remove the sign. The
Township shall have the right to recover from the owner of the sign the full costs
of removing and disposing of the sign. (Ord. 07-02; 8/20/07)

21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
CHAPTER XXI
SPECIAL USES
(Ord. 06-01; 02/26/06)
(Ord. 06-07; 08/24/06)
(Ord. 09-01; 3/31/09)
(Ord. 11-03; 6/20/11)
SECTION 21.01 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to provide regulations for uses which are not essentially
incompatible with uses permitted by right in a given district but which should not be
permitted without restrictions or conditions being imposed by reason of special
problems presented by the use itself or its particular location in relation to neighboring
properties. The special use permit procedure established herein is designed to provide
the Planning Commission with an opportunity to review and act upon any application for
a conditional use permit.
SECTION 21.02 PROCEDURE FOR ALL SPECIAL USES.
Any special use shall meet and continuously follow and adhere to the approved site
development plan conditions placed upon the use, and the requirements for approval
and the requirements of the district in which they are located.
(a) APPLICATIONS--The applicant shall submit to the Planning Commission,
through the Township Clerk, an application which shall include a site plan per the
requirements of Chapter 18, and written evidence and drawings showing that all
requirements for the applicable special use are met.
(b) NOTICES -- Upon receipt of such application, one (1) notice that a request for a
special land use has been received shall be published within a newspaper which
circulates within the township, an additional notice shall be sent by mail or by
personal delivery to all owners of property to whom real property is assessed and
to all occupants of structures within 300 feet of the boundary of the property that
is the subject of the application and to the petitioner.
(c) NOTICE TIMING-- Such notice must be given no less than five (5) days nor more
than fifteen (15) days before the date the application will be considered.
(d) NOTIFICATION ITEMS – The notice shall include the following:
(1) Describe the nature of the special land use requested.
(2) Indicate the property which is subject of the special land use request.
(3) State when and where the special land use request will be considered.
(4) Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning
the request.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 1 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
(5) Indicate that a public hearing on the special land use request may be
requested by the property owner as the occupant of any structure within
three hundred (300) feet of the boundary of the property being considered
for a special use.
(e) PUBLIC HEARING – Upon the initiative of the Planning Commission, Township
Board, or Building Inspector, as the case may be, the applicant or the owner of
the property or occupant of the structure within three hundred (300) feet of the
boundary of the subject property, a public hearing will be held before a decision
is made with notice given as stated in Sections 21.02 (c) and (d); however, a
second notice is not required if initiated by the Planning Commission, Township
Board, or Building Inspector, or the applicant and the notice specifies it is a public
hearing and a prior notice was not given before such initiation by the Planning
Commission, Township Board, or Building Inspector, or applicant.
(f) CONDITIONS – Reasonable conditions may be required with the approval of a
special land use, by the Planning Commission, Township Board, or Building
Inspector, as the case may be. The conditions may include, but are not limited
to, conditions necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a
proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased
service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural
environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility
with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the
following requirements:
(1) Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare
and the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use
or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately
adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a
whole.
(2) Be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes which
will be affected by the proposed use or activity.
(3) Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be
related to the standards established in the ordinance for the land use or
activity under consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with
those standards.
(g) RECORD OF CONDITIONS – The conditions imposed with respect to the
approval of a special land use shall be recorded in the record of the approval
action, and shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the
Planning Commission, Township Board, or Building Inspector, as the case may
be, and the landowner. The approving Planning Commission, Township Board,
or Building Inspector, as the case may be, shall maintain a record of conditions
which are changed.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 2 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
(h) STANDARDS -- The following general standards shall serve as the basis for
decisions by the Planning Commission involving special use permits. The
Commission shall find that, in addition to specific standards listed herein for a
particular use, the proposed use shall:
(1.) Be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so it will be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the area in which it is proposed.
(2.) Be adequately served by essential public facilities and services such as
highways, streets, police, fire protection, drainage structures, water and
sewage facilities and schools.
(3.) Not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public
facilities and services.
(4.) Not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, and equipment, or
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, or odors.
(5.) Be consistent with the intent and purpose of the zoning district in which
such use will be located and not set precedents for development which
could adversely affect the long term plans and policies of the Township.
(6.) Be compatible and in accordance with the Alpine Township Master Plan.
(Ord. No. 91-3; 8/26/91)
SECTION 21.03 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
If a violation of any of the above conditions, regulations, or special conditions is found to
exist following inspection, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the owner of the
premises of the special use, and the Planning Commission, Township Board, or
Building Inspector (whichever allowed the special use) that such violation exists and
that the permit will be revoked within fifteen (15) days of such notification. If said
violation is not corrected within fifteen (15) days, the body or official who allowed the
special use shall revoke the permit.
SECTION 21.04 HOUSING FOR SENIORS OR RETIRED PERSONS (Ord. 06-01;
02/26/06)
The following shall apply:
(a) The facility may include independent living units, basic or intermediate nursing
care, meal services, recreation and health facilities. Other uses may be included
if deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission.
(b) The minimum lot size for the development shall be two (2) acres and the housing
density shall not exceed eight (8) dwelling units per acre unless the requirements
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 3 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
of this subsection (b) are waived or varied by the Planning Commission using the
standards in Section 21.02(h).
(c) No part of the building or buildings so used is closer than 100 feet to an adjacent
lot line; except that the Planning Commission may reduce this setback
requirement to not less than 25 feet if it finds such reduction in the set back will
not be injurious to the use or enjoyment of nearby properties; will not result in
traffic or other safety hazards; will not result in visual blight, distraction, or clutter;
and will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this Ordinance or the
public’s interest. In modifying such set back requirements, the Planning
Commission may attach conditions regarding the location, character,
landscaping, or treatment of the buildings or premises or other such matters as
are reasonably necessary to the furtherance of the intent and spirit of this
Ordinance and the public’s interest.
(d) Each dwelling unit shall contain a minimum of 400 square feet of finished floor
area, exclusive of basement and attic space unless the Planning Commission
waives or varies such requirement under the standards contained in
Section 21.02(h).
SECTION 21.05 REMOVAL OF NATURAL RESOURCES.
Special Use. The removal or extraction of sand, gravel, soil, rock, minerals, and similar
natural resources or the reshaping, enlarging, straightening, damming or diminuation of
lakes, waterways, pond, or other bodies of water is only permitted with the intent and in
such manner as to prepare or render the premises suitable for the primary intended
uses of the district in which such premises is located. No such operation, change,
removal, or extraction shall be permitted by the Planning Commission unless the
following provisions are complied with:
(a) EXCEPTIONS -- The provisions of this section shall not apply to
the following:
(1) Where the removal or extraction of natural resources is more
than five hundred (500) feet from any street or property line,
occupies not more than one (1) acre in area, does not
constitute an average intensity of use of more than five (5)
yards of material per day and creates no area which fills with
water other than a watering pond for farms.
(2) The control and regulation of oil or gas.
(b) PROCEDURE FOR PERMIT—No building permit shall be issued to
the owner of any parcel of land or body of water desiring to proceed
with any undertaking set forth in Section 21.04 until application to
the Planning Commission for a temporary occupancy permit has
been approved. Said application shall include the following
information and fees:
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 4 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
(1) A fee of five ($5.00) dollars for each acre of land affected or
from which the natural resources are to be removed.
(2) A map of the parcel to be so changed depicting all buildings,
streets, drainage facilities, and natural features within two
hundred (200) feet thereof, which map shall show contour
elevation readings at five (5) foot intervals along the
perimeter of the subject property or portion involved.
(3) A two-foot interval contour plan of proposed final elevations,
the location of proposed temporary structures, drives,
parking areas, loading equipment, drainage facilities, and the
extent of the operating during the first year.

the process involved, estimating the time such removal will
require, describing the proposed use of the premises after
such removal and an agreement to conform to the provisions
of this section.
(c) REQUIRED CONDITIONS – The following conditions shall be
complied with:
(1) Final grades shall be harmonious with surrounding grades
and shall not be in excess of ten percent unless
demonstrably necessary for future intended use of the land.
Topsoil may be removed from the property, but in no case
shall the amount of topsoil removed exceed that amount
which would leave the premises with a minimum of four
inches of topsoil for the entire site. Except as provided in (c)
of this section, no final grades shall be as such to create any
area which will fill with water after the removal operation. No
removal shall be permitted below the grades of the proposed
plan unless a surety bond satisfactory to the township board
is posted with the township to insure that the final grades of
the plan will be met by the expiration date of the building
permit.
(2) No mechanical processing of natural resources shall be
permitted in any R or C district where such operation would
be detrimental to an adjacent conforming use of land. Storm
or water run-off shall be led to existing drainage systems in a
manner approved by the township and the county.
(3) The creation or enlargement of a lake shall only be permitted
where the applicant can demonstrate from engineering and
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 5 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
(4) The alteration, straightening, damming, widening, or
diminuation of a waterway or body of water shall be
approved by the said Department and Commission.

County to protect or repair the roads and to insure the safety
of the public.
(7) All structures and stored material equipment shall be
removed from the property within six (6) months of the
discontinuance of the use for removal or extraction of natural
resources. All land shall be graded to final elevations and
re-seeded so as to avoid erosion following the expiration of
activities.
(d) DETERMINATION BY PLANNING COMMISSION –Following
public hearing, the Planning Commission shall determine the
proper disposition of the application. In making its determination,
the Planning Commission shall determine that the proposed
change or removal will:
(1) Prepare or render the premises for a permitted primary
intended use for its district in a reasonable period of time.
(2) Not adversely affect permitted uses in the district.
(3) Conform to all provision of this section.
(4) Not create any condition which will adversely affect the

necessary building permit and a temporary occupancy permit for a
one-year period. All approved plans, sureties, recommendations,
reports and special conditions shall be filed by the Building
Inspector for future reference.
(f) PERMIT AND RENEWAL OF PERMIT. An occupancy permit may
be issued for three (3) years and may be renewed for up to three
(3) years at a time or for the duration of an accepted surety bond,
whichever is lesser, upon a finding by the Planning Commission
that all conditions and plans are being complied with and no
nuisance had been created by prior operations. Where any new
area is to be considered, or where any area not shown by the
contour plan of Section 21.04(b)(3) is to be included, the
procedures for a new application shall be followed.
(g) REVOCATION OF PERMIT. The Building Inspector shall revoke
an occupancy permit where operations do not conform to approved
plans or special conditions. All operations shall cease 14 days
following notification by the Building Inspector of such violations
unless such conditions are corrected. Reinstatement of a revoked
permit shall require a new application and approval therefor.
Any person, firm, corporation, trust, partnership or other legal entity
which violates or refuses to comply with any provision of this
chapter of this Ordinance shall be responsible for a municipal civil
infraction and shall be punished by a civil fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for a first violation and five hundred dollars
($500.00) for a second or subsequent violation. In addition to the
penalties set forth above, a person, firm, corporation, trust,
partnership or other legal entity which violates or refuses to comply
with any provision of this chapter shall be subject to the penalties
and provisions contained in subsections (a-e) of Section 24.05.
(Ord. No. 95-6; 7/17/95)
SECTION 21.06 UNPLATTED AND PLATTED PROJECTS IN THE R-A ZONE
(a) PURPOSE – Single family detached dwelling units are considered to be a use
which can, in most instances, be compatible with other permitted uses in the R-A
Zone, principally farming uses, due to the larger lots required. Single family
dwellings which are part of a condominium project or traditional plat, however,
may not be compatible with farm operations and may, therefore, not be
appropriate in all locations in the R-A Zone. Such projects are essentially
subdivisions.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 7 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
The construction of several non-farm residences, which would be built over a
period of years in the vicinity of an active farm, are unlikely to adversely affect the
farm operation. A subdivision, however, in the same location would be much
more rapid in occurrence and of greater scale, and therefore poses more of a
threat to the viability of the farming operation.
In order to protect the viability and integrity of farm operations, to guard against
the premature loss of farmland, as well as to provide a measure of protection for
non-farm residents from the nuisance characteristics of farming, subdivisions
shall be subject to special approval by the Planning Commission. Such a
procedure will enable the Commission to more effectively manage the location,
size, and timing of subdivisions in the R-A Zone so they can be compatible with
active farm operations in the same zone and to also preserve the long-term
farming practices in the Agricultural Zone, as recommended in the Alpine
Township Master Plan.
(b) SITE LOCATION STANDARDS – Subdivisions in the R-A Zone shall be located
according to the following criteria:
(1) Subdivision shall have direct access to a paved roadway.
(2) Subdivisions shall be located such that they are part of a logical residential
growth pattern extending outward from developed or developing
residential areas so that such projects do not “leapfrog” into areas of
active farms.
(3) Subdivision projects shall be located where public sanitary sewer is
available or can be economically and efficiently provided for the long-term
health and safety of project residents and where a potable source of water
can be supplied.
(4) Subdivisions shall be located such that project residents and farm
operations will not adversely affect each other.
(5) Such projects shall not be located on land that is classified as prime or
unique by the United States Department of Agriculture.
(c) APPROVAL STANDARDS—In addition to the Standards of Approval for all
Special Uses as contained herein, the Planning Commission, before approval for
subdivisions in the R-A Zone shall find:
(1) That future residents of the proposed subdivision will not be adversely
affected by nearby farming activities such as spraying of pesticides,
spreading manure, operation of farm equipment in early morning or night,
or other similar activities, or the Commission shall find that measures can
be implemented to mitigate the adverse affects of such activities.
(2) That any nearby farming operations will not be hampered or economically
threatened by the subdivision project due to an increase in traffic on
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 8 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
adjacent roadways, complaints from nearby residents regarding farm
operations, or the possibility of subdivision residents interfering with farm
operations by trespassing on farm property or posing a hazard or
nuisance to farm animals.
(3) The proposed project will not have a detrimental impact on the natural
features of the site such as steep slopes, wetlands, drainage, and mature
woodlots, and that steps will be taken to protect nearby streams and
drains during and after construction. (Ord. No. 91-3; 8/26/91)
SECTION 21.07 VALIDITY OF SPECIAL LAND USE PERMIT
(a) In cases where actual physical construction of a substantial nature of the
structures authorized by a special land use permit has not commenced within
one year of issuance, and a written application for extension of the approval has
not been filed as provided in Subsection (b) below, the permit shall automatically
be terminated and all rights thereunder shall terminate. The one year period
shall commence on the date when the site plan is signed for approval by the
chairperson of the Planning Commission or Site Plan Review Committee as the
case may be.
(b) Upon written application filed prior to the termination of the one year period, the
Planning Commission may authorize a single extension of the time limit for a
further period of not more than one year. Such extension shall only be granted
based on evidence from the applicant that the development has a reasonable
likelihood of commencing construction within the one year extension.
(c) An application for a special land use permit which has been denied wholly or in
part shall not be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order
of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions
relating to all of the reasons noted for the denial found to be valid by the Planning
Commission.
SECTION 21.08 ANTENNAS AND TOWERS ABOVE A CERTAIN HEIGHT OR
EXCEEDING A CERTAIN DIMENSION.
Freestanding radio, television, or microwave antennas or towers including cellular
phone antennas, exceeding a height of 35 feet above grade, or exceeding a dimension
of 35 feet in any other direction, including any mounting structure, may be approved by
the Planning Commission as a special land use upon compliance with the following
conditions:
(a) Any such antenna or tower shall be permanently secured to a
stable foundation. It shall be grounded to protect against damage

located on a smaller leased parcel or area within such lot or
parcel.
Parcels of land leased for more than one year are deemed to
be a land division per the state Land Division Act (P.A. 288
of 1967). Such leases of land for a WES or MET tower will
be treated as a tax parcel division by the Township, but will
not be deemed to create a lot for Township Zoning
purposes. Therefore, lot area, width and frontage of the
respective zoning district are not applicable.
(iii) Setbacks for Towers from Dwellings. The distance between a Utility
Grid WES and a dwelling on a non-leased property shall be at least
1,320 feet as measured from the base of the WES to the nearest

the WES or MET Tower becomes obsolete or abandoned.
(6) Removal.
(i) A WES or any structure or equipment regulated under the terms of
this section shall be removed by the applicant not later than when
the device or equipment is no longer consistently operating or when
it has been abandoned.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a WES shall be deemed abandoned
when it has not produced appreciable amounts of electrical energy
for 12 consecutive months. Operation of the WES for less than 168
hours within 12 consecutive months shall not be considered
production for purposes of this subsection.
(iii) The failure to timely remove a WES or any structure or equipment
regulated by the terms of this section shall be a violation of this
Ordinance and may be abated as a nuisance per se.
(7) Insurance. The WES operator shall maintain a current insurance policy

Section 21.10 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
The Township hereby adopts and incorporates as the rationale for this section of the
Zoning Ordinance the Legislative Findings and record related to the adverse secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses adopted by separate resolution of the Township
Board (Resolution No. 11-04). Without limiting the foregoing, the Township further finds
and states that the purpose and intent of this Section is to minimize the negative
secondary effects associated with Sexually Oriented Businesses through regulating, but
not excluding, the location and operation of Sexually Oriented Businesses within the
Township. It is recognized that Sexually Oriented Businesses, because of their very
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 20 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics which cause negative
secondary effects upon nearby residential, educational, religious and other similar
public and private land uses. The regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses is
necessary to ensure that these negative secondary effects will neither adversely impact
the health, safety and general welfare of Township residents, nor contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of surrounding areas. The provisions of this Section are not
intended: (i) to violate the guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution or Article I, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963; (ii) to deny
adults access to Sexually Oriented Businesses and their products; (iii) to deny Sexually
Oriented Businesses access to their intended market; or (iv) to legitimatize activities
which are prohibited by Township ordinance, state or federal law. The Township further
states that it would have passed and adopted what might remain of this Section
following the removal, reduction or revision of any portion of this Section found to be
invalid or unconstitutional.
(a) Regulated Uses. Uses subject to theses regulations are as follows:
Adult Arcades, Adult Cabaret, Adult Merchandise Store, Adult Motion Picture
Film Studio, Adult Motion Picture Theater, Adult Motel, Adult Theater, Massage
Establishment, Massage School, Nude Model Studio, Sexual Encounter Center,
Sexual Oriented Business, or other commercial enterprise regularly featuring the
sale, rental or exhibition for consideration of books, films, videos, DVDs or other
visual representation of live performances characterized by an emphasis on the
display of specified anatomical areas or sexual activities or a commercial
enterprise that regularly features activities that expose specified anatomical
areas or involves specified sexual activities.
(b) Notification and Use Requirements. Any of the regulated uses in Section 21.10
identified herein as “Sexually Oriented Businesses” are permitted only after a
public hearing is held, which hearing was preceded (in addition to the notice
required in Section 21.02), by mailing of a notice to all property owners and
occupants of structures within a five hundred (500) foot radius of the subject
property, stating the time, place, and purpose of the meeting. Following the
public hearing the Planning Commission may approve the use if it determines
that all of the following standards are met:
(1) The use is located solely within a "C-2" Commercial Zone.
(2) The use will not be established on a parcel within five hundred (500) feet
of any residential district or any parcel used for a single or multiple family
residence, public park, school, licensed child day care center, church or
place of worship, public library, hospital, Township office, or commercially
operated school attended by children (e.g., dance schools, gymnastic
centers, etc.), regardless if located in Alpine Township or another
municipality. With respect to such spacing determination, the following
guidelines apply:
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 21 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
(i) The distance between a proposed sexually oriented business and a
zoning district or existing use shall be measured in a straight line
from the nearest property line upon which the proposed sexually
oriented business is to be located to the nearest property line of that
zoned area or existing use.
(ii) A sexually oriented business lawfully operating is not rendered a
nonconforming use by the subsequent location of one or more of the
uses listed in this subsection 2 above; provided however, that if the
sexually oriented business ceases operation for a period of one (1)
year or more, it shall, as a matter of law and without regard of any
intent to resume operation, not recommence operation at that
location.
(3) The use will not be located within five hundred (500) feet of another
sexually oriented business as measured in subsection 2(i) above, except
that such restriction may be waived by the Planning Commission, if it finds
all of the following exist:
(i) That the proximity of the uses will not be contrary to the public
interest or injurious to nearby properties and that the spirit and
intent of this section will be observed.
(ii) That the proximity of the uses will not enlarge or encourage the
development of a blighted or deteriorating area in its immediate
surroundings.
(iii) That the proximity of the uses will not be contrary to any program of
neighborhood conservation, and will not interfere with any program
of urban renewal.
(iv) That all applicable state laws and local ordinances will be observed.
(4) Multiple Businesses. No sexually oriented business shall be located within
a principal building that is occupied by another use, an accessory building,
or on the same parcel already containing another sexually oriented
business.
(5) Entrances. The entrances to the proposed sexually oriented business at
the exterior walls, in a location visible to those entering the business, must
be clearly marked with lettering at least two (2) inches in height stating:
(i) “Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to enter
the premises;” and
(ii) “No alcoholic beverages of any type are permitted within the
premises;” unless specifically allowed pursuant to a license duly
issued by the Liquor Control Commission.
(6) Visibility of Merchandise or Services.
(a) An Adult Merchandise Store may only display in its window(s)
merchandise that does not depict, describe or relate to any
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 22 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
specified sexual activity or any specified anatomical area. Sexually
Graphic Signs as defined herein are prohibited in windows and
doors.
(b) For all other sexually oriented businesses, no product or service for
sale, rent or gift, or any picture or other representation of any
product or service for sale, rent or gift, shall be displayed so as to be
visible to a person outside the building whether through a window,
doorway or otherwise. Sexually Graphic Signs as defined herein are
prohibited in windows and doors.
(7) Booths or Rooms. Any booth, room or cubicle available in any sexually
oriented business, except an adult motel, that is used by patrons for the
viewing of any entertainment characterized by the showing of specified
anatomical areas or specified sexual activities shall:
(i) Be unobstructed by any floor, lock or other entrance and exit
control device;
(ii) Have at least one (1) side totally open to a public, lighted aisle so
that there is an unobstructed view of any occupant at all times from
the adjoining aisle;
(iii) Be illuminated such that a person of normal visual acuity can, by
looking into the booth, room or cubicle from its entrance adjoining
the public lighted aisle, clearly determine the number of people
within; and
(iv) Have no holes or openings in any side or rear walls not relating to
utility, ventilation or temperature control services or otherwise
required by any governmental building code authority.

shall comply with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. In addition,
the parking lot shall be illuminated after sunset during all hours of
operation of the sexually oriented business until one (1) hour after the
business closes. The illumination shall be designed to provide a minimum
level of brightness of one (1) foot candle, with a 3:1 uniformity ratio on the
parking surface and walkways. This required lighting level is established
in order to provide sufficient illumination of the parking areas and
walkways serving the sexually oriented business to help ensure the
personal safety of patrons and employees and to reduce the incidence of
vandalism and other criminal conduct.
(10) Other Regulations. The proposed use shall be in compliance with all other
ordinances of the Township and with all statutes, laws, rules and
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 21 - 23 Special Uses
21.01 – 21.10 Special Uses
regulations of the County, State and Federal government and, to the
extent required, all governmental approvals must be obtained.

an approved site plan to the Planning Commission for review and approval,
regardless of whether the change may qualify as a minor change.
(c) Should the Planning Director determine that the requested modification to the
approved site plan is not minor, re-submission to the Planning Commission for an
amendment to the preliminary development plan and PUD rezoning shall be
required and conducted in the same manner as an original application.
PUD 22.01 – 22.11
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 22 - 10 PUD Procedures
SECTION 22.10 TIME LIMITATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT
Each PUD shall be under construction within one (1) year after the date of approval of the
Final Site Development Plan.. If this requirement is not met, the Planning Commission
may, in its discretion, grant a one-time extension not exceeding one year, provided that
the PUD applicant submits reasonable evidence to the effect that unforeseen difficulties
or special circumstances have been encountered, causing delay in commencement of
the PUD. Such extension shall be requested by the applicant and must be submitted in
writing to the Township at least one month before expiration of the Final Site Development
Plan.
If the PUD has not been commenced within the above-stated period of time, or within any
authorized extension thereof, any building permits issued for the PUD or any part thereof
shall be of no further effect at the conclusion of said periods of time and all development
rights granted by the PUD approval shall be null and void. Further, the Planning
Commission and Township Board may, in their discretion, initiate proceedings to rezone
the land to its previous zoning district, or to another zoning district, as appropriate.
SECTION 22.11 PHASED PROJECTS
(a) If a PUD is authorized for construction in phases, it shall be designed and
constructed such that each phase, when complete, includes all services, facilities,
and open space necessary for the full occupancy and use of that phase. Further,
each phase shall include all necessary elements to ensure protection of natural
features and the health, safety and welfare of the residents and users of the PUD.
(b) Each phase of a PUD shall be commenced and/or completed within the time period
specified in the PUD’s approved phasing plan. If construction of a phase is not
commenced within the required time period, the provisions for a requested
extension and the expiration of the PUD approval set forth in Section 22.10 shall
apply.

CHAPTER XXIII
BOARD OF APPEALS
SECTION 23.01 MEMBERS, PER DIEM EXPENSES AND REMOVAL.
There is hereby continued and/or created a Zoning Board of Appeals of five (5)
members. The first member of such Board of Appeals shall be a member of the
Township Planning Commission and appointed by the Township Board. The
remaining members shall be appointed by the Township Board; and shall be
selected from among the electors residing in the unincorporated area of the
Township and shall represent the population distribution of the various interests
present in the Township; provided that no employee or contractor of the
Township Board may serve as a member of or as an employee of the Township
Board of Appeals, and that no elected officer of the Township shall serve as
chairman of the Board of Appeals.
The Township Board shall appoint two alternate members who shall serve in the
case of the absence or temporary incapacity of the regular members of the
Zoning Board of Appeals. The total amount allowed such Board of Appeals in
any one year as per diem or as expenses actually incurred in the discharge of
their duties shall be a reasonable sum which shall be provided annually in
advance by the Township Board. Members of the Board of Appeals shall be
removable by the Township Board for non-performance of duty or misconduct in
office upon written charges and after a public hearing. (Ord. No. 15-82; 7/19/82).
SECTION 23.02 OFFICERS.
The Board shall elect from its membership a chairman, vice chairman, and
such other officers as deemed necessary.
SECTION 23.03 RULES OF PROCEDURE.
The Board shall adopt procedural rules and regulations. Copies of such
regulations shall be made available to the public at the office of the Township
Clerk.
(a) Meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as the Board may
determine. There shall be a fixed place of meeting and all hearings shall
be open to the public.
(b) The presence of a majority of total members shall constitute a quorum.
The Board shall act by resolution. The concurring vote of a majority of
members present of said Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Building Inspector or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 23 - 1 Zoning Board of Appeals
23.01 – 23.11 Board of Appeals
pass by this Ordinance, or to grant variances from the requirements of this
Ordinance.
(c) The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the action of the
Board, the reasons on which it bases its action, and the vote of each
member upon each question, or, if absent, or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its proceedings and other official
action, all of which shall be filed promptly in the office of the Board and
shall be a public record.
(d) A copy of each resolution passed upon by the said Board of Appeals shall
be filed with the Clerk of the Township and to the secretary of the Zoning
Board.
SECTION 23.04 JURISDICTION.
The Board of Appeals, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, may
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements,
decision, or determination appealed from, and shall make such order,
requirements, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made on the
premises, and to that end shall have all the powers to hear and decide all matters
referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance; also where
it is alleged by the appellant that there is error or misinterpretation in any order,
requirements, decision, grant or refusal made by the Building Inspector or other
administrative officer in the carrying out or enforcement of the provisions of this
ordinance.
SECTION 23.05 VARIANCES.
Subject to the provisions of Section 23.06, the Board, after public hearing, shall
have the power to decide the applications, filed as hereafter provided, for
variances:
(a) Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness in width, breadth, length, or
shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of this
ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other
extraordinary situation or condition of the land, building, or structure, or of
the use of or development of property immediately adjoining the property
in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this ordinance
would involve practical difficulties or would cause undue hardship;
provided that the Board shall not grant a variance on a lot of less area
than the requirements of its zone district, even though such lot existed at
the time of passage of this ordinance, if the owners or members of his
immediate family own adjacent land which can, without undue hardship,
be included as part of the lot.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 23 - 2 Zoning Board of Appeals
23.01 – 23.11 Board of Appeals
(b) Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of such ordinance relating to the
construction, structural changes in equipment, or alterations of buildings or
structures, or the use of land, buildings or structures, so that the spirit of
this ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial
justice done.
SECTION 23.06 GENERAL.
No variance in the provisions or requirements of this ordinance shall be
authorized by the Board unless the Board finds, from reasonable evidence that
all the following facts and conditions exist:
(a) That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property in question as to the intended use of the property
that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district.
(b) That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in
the same zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility of increased
financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a
variance.
(c) That the authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to
adjacent property and will not materially impair the intent and purposes of
this ordinance or the public interest.
(d) That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property, or the
intended use of said property for which the variance is sought is not of so
general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the
formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situation.
SECTION 23.07 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
Reasonable conditions may be required with the approval of a variance by the
Zoning Board of Appeals. The conditions may include, but are not limited to,
conditions necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a
proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased
service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural
environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility
with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the
following requirements:
(a) Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare
and the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 23 - 3 Zoning Board of Appeals
23.01 – 23.11 Board of Appeals
or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately
adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a
whole.
(b) Be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes which
are affected by the proposed use or activity.
(c) Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be
related to the standards established in the ordinance for the land use or
activity under consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with
those standards.
The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a special land use shall
be recorded in the record of the approval action, and shall remain unchanged
except upon the mutual consent of the Zoning Board of Appeals and landowner.
The approving Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain a record of conditions
which are changed. (Ord. No. 13-79; 10/16/79)
SECTION 23.08 PROCEDURE.
The following procedure shall be required:
(a) An appeal for variance from any ruling of the Building Inspector or other
administrative officer administering any portion of this ordinance may be
taken by any person, partnership, corporation, or any governmental
department affected or aggrieved. All matters coming before the Board of
Appeals by the Zoning Board for consideration as required by the Zoning
Ordinance. When a matter is so referred by the Zoning Board, no fee
shall be charged.
(b) Fees. The required fees for a hearing before the Board of Appeals are a
part of the cost of any building permit and are in addition to other building
permit fees.
If a petition is filed for a hearing before the Board of Appeals, a fee of
seventy-five ($75.00) dollars shall accompany said petition.
Said fee shall be paid to the Township Clerk before any action shall be
taken on said petition. Said amount so received shall be used as provided
by law. Fees may be changed by the Township Board at any regular
meeting, which change shall be effective thirty (30) days from the date of
publication of such change.
(c) When an application for hearing or appeal has been filed in proper form
and the fee paid with the required data, the Secretary of the Board shall
immediately place the said application or appeal upon the calendar for
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 23 - 4 Zoning Board of Appeals
23.01 – 23.11 Board of Appeals
hearing and cause notices stating the time, place, and object of the
hearing to be served. Such notices shall be served personally or by mail
at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the day of such hearing, or other
administrative body from which such appeal is taken. A like notice shall
be sent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the hearing to all owners of
property as shown by the Township Treasurer's Office within three
hundred (300) feet of the premises involved by regular United States Mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address of such property
owners as shown by said records. Any interested party may appear and
be heard at such hearings, in person or by agent or attorney.
(d) Upon the day for hearing any application or appeal, the Board may
adjourn the hearing in order to permit the obtaining of additional
information, or to cause such further notice as it deems proper to be
served or for further consideration of the matter involved. In the case of
an adjourned hearing, persons previously notified and persons already
heard need not be notified of the time of resumption of said hearing unless
the Board so decides, provided, however, any adjournment shall be stated
at the hearing giving the date, time, and place to which adjournment is
made.
SECTION 23.09 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD.
(a) The Board shall decide all applications and appeals within thirty (30) days
after the final hearing thereon. A copy of the Board's decision shall be
transmitted to the applicant or appellant and to the Building Inspector.
Such decision shall be binding upon the Building Inspector and observed
by him and he shall incorporate the terms and conditions of the same in
the permit to the applicant or appellant whenever a permit is authorized by
the Board. A decision of the Board shall not become final until the
expiration of five (5) days from the date such decision is made, unless the
Board shall find that immediate effect of such decision is necessary for the
preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the
record. (Ord. No. 226; 6/6/78)
(b) In the event the Board of Appeals grants a variance, the individual or his
successor in interest shall not use the property in question such that it
would exceed those rights given by the zoning ordinance or the variance
or fail to follow any conditions placed thereon by the Board of Appeals. In
the event the use of the property exceeds those rights given by the zoning
ordinance or the variance, or fails to follow the conditions placed upon the
variance, the variance shall immediately terminate. (Ord. No. 226; 6/6/78)

SECTION 23.10 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Building Inspector certifies to the Board of Appeals after notice of
appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of fact stated in the
certificate, a stay, would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.
In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining

granting of such variance.
(b) Upon written application filed with the Township Clerk prior to the
termination of the one year time period, the Board of Appeals may

beyond the control of the applicant.

SECTION 24.01 BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED.
It shall be unlawful for any person to commence excavation for construction of
any building, structure, or parking area, or to make structural changes in any
existing building or structure, or to change the use of any premises, without first
obtaining a building permit from the Township Building Inspector. No permit shall
be issued for the construction, alteration, or remodeling of any building or
structure until an application has been submitted showing that the construction
proposed is in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and with the
Building Code, and a site plan is submitted on approval in accord with Section
11.03(h). No plumbing, electrical or drainage permit shall be issued until the
Building Inspector has determined that the plans and designated use indicate
that the structure and premises, if constructed as planned and proposed, will
conform with the provisions of this Ordinance. (Ord. No. 13-79; 10/16/79)
SECTION 24.02 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS.
The Township Board shall appoint a Zoning Administrator to administer and
enforce the provisions of this Ordinance. The Building Inspector may also serve
as the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator or his or her agent shall
also have the authority to receive applications, inspect premises for violations,
issue building permits, and institute proceedings for enforcement of this Zoning
Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator or his or her designated agent is
specifically authorized to issue and serve appearance tickets, based on
reasonable cause, on any person, business, or organization in violation of any of
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and for which a fine, imprisonment, or
both may be levied as a result of such violation. (Ord. No. 90-2; 5/21/90)
SECTION 24.03 PERMITS.
Every application for a building permit shall be made as required by the Building
Code and shall designate the existing or intended use of the structure or
premises, or part thereof which is proposed to be altered, erected, or extended,
and the number of dwelling units, if any, to be occupied. The application shall be
accompanied by two ink, blueprint, or photostatic copies of drawings, drawn to
scale, showing the actual lines, angles, and dimensions of the lot to be built upon
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 1 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
or used, and the size and location on the lot of all existing and proposed
structures and uses, together with specifications.
The application shall contain other information with respect to the lot and
adjoining property as may be required by the Building Inspector. One copy of
both plans and specifications shall be filed in and retained by the Office of the
Building Inspector, and the other shall be delivered to the applicant when the
Building Inspector has approved the application and issued the permit. In cases
of minor alterations, the Building Inspector may waive portions of the foregoing
requirements obviously not necessary for determination of compliance with this
Ordinance.
Any permit required by this Zoning Ordinance or the Building Code of this
Township shall be displayed face out, within twenty-four (24) hours of its
issuance by placing the same in a conspicuous place on the premises facing the
nearest highway, and shall be continuously so displayed until all work, or the
term for which issued, or purpose for which issued is completed. Failure to
obtain and display any such permit shall constitute a violation of the Zoning
Ordinance and Building Code and shall subject each person or persons or
corporations who performs or authorized the performance of any act for which a
building permit is required, and the owner or owners of the premises involved to
prosecution for such violation.
SECTION 24.04 OCCUPANCY.
It shall be unlawful to use or permit the use of any structure or premises hereafter
altered, extended or erected, until the Building Inspector shall have made an
inspection of the premises and shall have approved the same in writing for
occupancy. The Building Inspector shall not issue a certificate of occupancy until
he has ascertained that there has been compliance with all of the requirements
of this Ordinance and the Building Code and substantially all of the approved
plans of the building.
A certificate of occupancy requested prior to the completion of improvements
noted on an approved site plan, noted as specific conditions of project approval
by the Alpine Township Planning Commission or Township Board, and/or
required in accordance with the Construction Code, may only be issued upon the
applicant’s filing with the Township a performance guarantee in a form
satisfactory to the Township. The performance guarantee shall be an irrevocable
letter of credit unless the Township approves a performance bond or other type
of security.
The performance guarantee must be accompanied by a detailed punch list of the
uncompleted improvements along with the corresponding estimated cost of
completing the same and a completion deadline. The amount of the performance
guarantee must be sufficient to cover all uncompleted improvements as
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 2 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
determined by the Township and must include a provision authorizing the
Township to utilize the performance guarantee if the applicant has not completed
the improvements in accordance with the approved deadlines. The Township will
hold the performance guarantee until all improvements have been inspected and
approved by the Township or as otherwise provided for in accordance with this
section. (Ord. No. 03-01; 01-23-03)
SECTION 24.05 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTY.
Unless a section of this Ordinance specifically provides otherwise any person,

offense, and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a fine for each
day.
(a) The owner of any building, structure or premises or part thereof,
where any condition in violation of this Ordinance shall exist or shall
be created or who has assisted knowingly in the commission of
such violation shall be liable to the fines and costs provided above.
(b) In addition to a civil fine, a person admitting or determined to be
responsible for a municipal civil infraction shall be liable for the
payment of the costs of the prosecution in an amount not less than
nine dollars ($9.00) or more than five hundred ($500.00).
(c) In addition to the penalties otherwise provided, the district court
shall have jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, writ or order
necessary to enforce any provision of this Ordinance, the violation
of which is a municipal civil infraction, including, but not limited to,
abatement of the violating condition or granting injunctive relief.
(d) Any building or structure which is erected, altered or converted, or
any use of premises or land which is begun or changed subsequent
to the effective date of this Ordinance and in violation of any of its
provisions is declared to be a public nuisance per se, and may be
abated by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(e) The rights and remedies provided for in this section are cumulative

24.06-A CONDITIONAL REZONING (Ord. 06-01; 02/26/06)
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 3 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
The Planning Commission and Township Board recognize that, in certain
instances, it would be an advantage to the Township and any property owners
seeking rezoning if the application for rezoning was accompanied by a site plan
and was subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, it is the intent of this Section
of the Zoning Ordinance to provide a conditional rezoning option to property
owners in connection with the submission of an application for rezoning. This
option is intended to accomplish the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance through
a rezoning review process that applies site planning criteria to achieve integration
of the development project into the fabric of the project area.
(a) Definitions
The following definitions should apply in the interpretation of this Section:
(1) Applicant: The property owner, or a person with the written and
signed authorization of the property owner to make application
under this Section.
(2) Conditional Rezoning Agreement (CR Agreement): A written
agreement approved and executed by the Township and property
owner, incorporating a CR Plan, and setting forth Rezoning
Conditions and any other terms mutually agreed upon by the
parties relative to land for which the Township has approved a
conditional rezoning.
(3) Conditional Rezoning Plan (CR Plan): A plan of the property
which is the subject of a conditional rezoning, prepared by a
licensed civil engineer or architect, that may show the location,
size, height, design, architecture, or other measure or feature of
buildings, structures and improvements on, and in some cases
adjacent to, the property. The details to be offered for inclusion on
a CR Plan shall be determined by the applicant, subject to approval
of the Township Board after recommendation by the Planning
Commission.
(4) Rezoning Conditions: Conditions proposed by the applicant and
approved by the Township as part of an approval under this
Section, which shall constitute regulations in connection with the
development and use of property for which conditional approval has
been granted. Such Rezoning Conditions shall not:
a. Authorize uses or developments of greater intensity of
density than are permitted in the district proposed by the
rezoning.
b. Authorize uses that are not permitted in the district proposed
by the rezoning.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 4 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
c. Permit uses or development expressly or implicitly prohibited
in the CR Agreement.
(5) Rezoning: The act of rezoning land from an existing zoning
district/classification to a different zoning district pursuant to
MCL 125.271, et seq., as amended. A rezoning constitutes an
amendment to the Zoning Map (which is an integral part of the
Zoning Ordinance).
(b) Authorization and Eligibility
(1) Application for Optional Conditional Rezoning. A property
owner shall have the option of seeking conditional rezoning in
connection with submission of an application seeking rezoning.
The conditional rezoning option shall be selected by filing an
Application for Conditional Rezoning Review, which, if approved,
would authorize a specific use for the property. Conditional
rezoning represents a legislative amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance, pursuant to MCL 125.268i.
(2) Site-Specific Regulations. In order to be eligible for review of an
application for conditional rezoning, a property owner must propose
a rezoning of property to a new zoning district classification, and
must, as part of such proposal, voluntarily offer certain site-specific
regulations (to be set forth on a CR Plan and CR Agreement) which
are equally more strict or limiting than the regulations that would
apply to the land under the proposed zoning district.
(c) Review and Approval Procedures
(1) Pre-Application Meeting. Prior to submitting an Application for
Conditional Rezoning, the applicant shall schedule a preapplication
meeting with the Township Supervisor and Township
Planner for preliminary review of the proposal and to provide the
applicant with an understanding of the review process. The
applicant shall pay the expenses incurred by the Township for this
meeting.
(2) Application. A property owner may submit an Application for
Conditional Rezoning at the time the application for rezoning is filed
or at a subsequent point in the process of review of the proposed
rezoning. The application, which may be amended during the
review process, shall include a CR Plan proposed by the applicant
and a list of Rezoning Conditions proposed by the applicant,
recognizing that the Rezoning Conditions shall not authorize uses
or development not permitted in the proposed zoning district.
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 5 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
(3) Planning Commission Review. After the completed application
and all required supporting materials have been received and fees
paid, the petition shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 24.01 (b) (1)
and (2).
a. Public Hearing. The petition shall be placed on the agenda
of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission shall review the
petition for amendment in accordance with the procedures
and public hearing and notice requirements set forth in
Section 14 and other applicable sections of Public Act 184 of
1943, as amended.
b. Action by the Planning Commission. Following the
hearing on the proposed amendment, the Planning
Commission shall make findings of fact which it shall
transmit to the Township Board, together with its comments
made at the public hearing and its recommendation.
(4) Township Board Consideration. Upon receipt of the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, the Township Board
shall deliberate on the proposed conditional rezoning. If the
Township Board determines that it may approve the conditional
rezoning, then the Township Board shall work with the landowner to
identify tentative conditions, and direct the Township Planner to
work with the applicant to develop a draft CR Agreement.
(5) Township Board Action. Upon completion of the CR Agreement,
the Township Board, by majority vote of its membership, shall make
a final determination to approve, approve with conditions, or deny
the conditional rezoning.
(6) Zoning District Designation. If approved, the zoning
classification of the rezoned property shall consist of the district to
which the property has been rezoned, accompanied by a reference
to “CR, Conditional Rezoning.” For example, in the C-2-
Commercial District the Zoning Map designation would be “C-
2/CR.” The use of property so designated shall be restricted to the
uses specified in the CR Agreement, and no other development or
use shall be permitted.
(7) Effects of Approval. The use of property in question shall
conform with all regulations governing development and use in the
zoning district to which the property has been rezoned, subject to
the following:
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 6 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
a. Development Subject to Conditional Rezoning
Requirements. Development and use of the property shall
be subject to the more restrictive requirements specified on
the CR Plan, in the Rezoning Conditions and in the CR
Agreement, required as part of the Conditional Rezoning
approval. Such requirements shall supersede all
inconsistent regulations otherwise applicable under the
Zoning Ordinance.
b. Site Plan Review Required. Approval of the CR Plan and
Agreement confirms only the rezoning of the property,
subject to any conditions imposed as reflected in the CR
Plan. Site plan, special land use, plat, and condominium
approval, as appropriate, shall be required, pursuant to
procedures set forth by the Alpine Township Zoning
Ordinance, prior to any improvements to the property.
c. Recordation of CR Agreement. A conditional rezoning
shall become effective following publication in the manner
provided by law, and after recordation of the CR Agreement,
whichever is later.
(8) Amendments of CR Agreement. Amendment of a CR Agreement
shall be proposed, reviewed, and approved in the same manner as
a new conditional rezoning application.
(9) Expiration of CR Agreement. The conditional rezoning approval
shall expire following a period of two (2) years from the effective
date of the rezoning unless: 1) approved development of the
property commences within such two (2) year period and proceeds
diligently and in good faith as required by ordinance to completion,
or 2) the rezoning is extended for good cause by the Township
Board as provided herein.
a. Extension of Approval. In the event that a bona fide
development has not commenced within two (2) years from

and CR Agreement shall be void and of no effect. However,
the land owner may apply to the Township Board for a one
(1) year extension one (1) time. The request for extension
must be submitted to the Township Clerk before the two (2)
year time limit expires. The land owner must show good
cause why the extension should be granted.

zoning classification, which shall be confirmed by resolution
of the Township Board.
(10) Violations of the CR Agreement. If development or actions are
undertaken on or with respect to the property in violation of the CR
Agreement, such development or actions shall constitute a
nuisance per se. In such case, the Township may issue a stop
work order relative to the property and seek any other lawful
remedies. Until curative action is taken to bring the property into
compliance with the CR Agreement, the Township may withhold,
or, following notice and an opportunity to be heard, revoke permits
and certificates, in addition to or in lieu of such other lawful action to
achieve compliance.
(11) Fees. The applicant shall pay as a fee the expenses incurred by
the Township in the review of any conditional rezoning application.
Additionally, zoning escrow fees or amounts shall be deposited with
the Township by the applicant as required by this Ordinance or
Township resolution or policy. Any unexpended amounts from
such escrow shall be returned to the applicant.

reviewed and may be approved:
(1) CR Plan. A CR Plan, with such details as proposed by the
applicant and approved by the Township Board in accordance with
this Section. The CR Plan shall not replace the requirements for
site plan, subdivision or condominium approval, as the case may
be.
(2) Rezoning Conditions. Rezoning conditions shall not authorize
uses or development which are not permitted in the proposed
zoning district, and shall not permit uses or development which are
expressly or implicitly prohibited in the CR Agreement. Rezoning
conditions may include some or all of the following:
a. The location, size, height, and setbacks of buildings,
structures, and improvements.

per acre, maximum usable floor area, hours of operation,
etc.).
c. Measures to preserve natural resources or features.

j. Permissible and prohibited uses of the property.
k. Provisions to preserve historic farms, barns and other
buildings to preserve the history of the Township.
l. Measures to protect the rural view shed, which is an
undeveloped area adjacent to the road right-of-way, having a
depth of at least two hundred (200) feet, where existing
natural features, such as wetlands, woodlands, hedgerows,
undulating landforms, and scenic vistas are preserved and
incorporated into the landscape.
m. Reclamation and reuse of land, where previous use of land
causes severe development difficulties, or has caused blight.
n. Drainage improvements, beyond what is required by
ordinance, using best management practices (BMP).
o. Such other conditions as deemed important to the
development by the applicant.
(3) CR Agreement. A CR Agreement, which shall be prepared by the
Township Planner and the applicant (or designee) and which shall
incorporate the CR Plan and set forth the Rezoning Conditions,
together with any other term mutually agreed upon by the parties,
including the following terms.
a. Agreement and acknowledgement that the conditional
rezoning was proposed by the applicant to induce the
Township to grant the rezoning, and that the Township relied
upon such proposal would not have granted the rezoning but
for the terms in the CR Agreement.
b. Agreement and acknowledgement that the conditions and
CR Agreement are authorized by all applicable state and
federal laws and constitution, and that the CR Agreement is
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 9 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
valid and was entered into only on a voluntary basis,
representing a permissible exercise of authority by the
Township.
c. Agreement and understanding that the property in question
shall not be developed or used in a manner that is
inconsistent with the CR Plan or CR Agreement.
d. Agreement and understanding that the approval and CR
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the property owner and the Township, and their respective
heirs, successors, assigns, and transferees.
e. Agreement and understanding that, if a conditional zoning
becomes void in the manner provided in this Section, no
development shall be undertaken or permits for development
issued until a new zoning district classification of the
property has been established.
f. Agreement and understanding that each of the requirements
and conditions in the CR Agreement represents a necessary
and reasonable measure which, when considered with all
other conditions and requirements, is roughly proportional to
the increased impact created by the use represented in the
approved conditional rezoning, taking into consideration the
changed zoning district classification and the specific use
authorization granted.
(e) Approval Criteria
The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the following
requirements and standards are met by the CR Plan, Rezoning
Conditions, and CR Agreement:
(1) Enhance the Project Area. The Township Board shall determine
that the approval of the conditional rezoning shall accomplish the
integration of the proposed land development project with the
characteristics of the project area, and result in an enhancement of
the project area, and such enhancement would be unlikely to be
achieved or would not be assured in the absence of the use of
conditional rezoning.
(2) In the Public Interest. The Township Board shall determine that,
in considering the site specific land use proposed by the applicant,
sufficient conditions have been included in the CR Plan and CR
Agreement so that it would be in the public interest to grant the
conditional rezoning. In determining whether approval of a
proposal would be in the public interest, the benefits that would be
Alpine Twp. Zoning Ordinance 24 - 10 Administration & Enforcement
24.01-24.07 Admin. & Enforce.
reasonably expected to accrue from the proposal shall be balanced
against, and be found to clearly outweigh the reasonably
foreseeable detriments thereof, taking into consideration
reasonably accepted, planning, engineering, environmental and
other principles.

POLICY GUIDELINES FOR
LANDSCAPING, BUFFER STRIPS, AND SCREENING
ADOPTED BY THE ALPINE TOWNSHIP PLANNING COMMISSION ON
AUGUST 17, 1989
INTENT The intent of this policy is to promote the public’s health, safety, and general
welfare by minimizing noise, air, and visual pollution; improving the appearance of offstreet
parking and other vehicular use, areas buffering incompatible land uses;
controlling the appearance of property abutting public rights-of-way; protecting and
preserving the appearance, character, and value of the community and its residential
neighborhood areas; preventing soil erosion and soil depletion; and promoting soil water
retention. The recommendations contained in this document are designed to assist
land planners, landscape architects, developers, and builders in providing landscaping
for their developments which will meet the desired landscaping objectives of the Alpine
Township Planning Commission.
a) This policy applies to all uses for which site plan review is required under Section
18.02 of the Alpine Township Zoning Ordinance.
b) For existing and proposed uses which require site plan approval to either expand
or be built, landscaping as noted herein should be installed insofar as practical.
The Site Plan Review Committee and Planning Commission in its review of the
site plan have the authority to vary the landscaping and screening guidelines for
such uses. In doing so, the Committee and Commission shall consider the
following criteria:
1) The amount of space on the site available for landscaping.
2) Existing landscaping on the site and on adjacent properties.
3) The type of use on the site and size of the development.
4) Existing and proposed adjacent land uses.
5) The effect which the required landscaping would have on the operation of
the existing or proposed land use.
GENERAL REGULATIONS
a) Landscaping shall be installed within one hundred eighty (180) days of
occupancy of the building or structure unless a longer period is permitted in
writing by the Building Inspector.
b) All landscaping shall be hardy plant materials and maintained thereafter in a
neat, healthy and orderly manner. Withered and/or dead plant materials shall be
replaced within a reasonable period of time, but no longer than one growing
season.
c) For the purpose of this Chapter, a corner lot is considered as having two front
yards and the appropriate landscaping shall be provided for both.
d) The extensive use of cobblestones, crushed stones, or other non-living material
as a ground cover should be minimized.

in height or walls of six (6) feet or greater, located where the greenbelt should be.
d) MINIMUM PLANT SIZE: All new plants in any required greenbelt shall meet the
minimum size requirements set forth herein.
e) LOCATION: Trees shall be planted no less than five (5) feet from a property line
where a greenbelt is located entirely on property in one zoning district. If one
property is in two zoning districts, the boundary between the districts may be the
approximate midpoint of the greenbelt.
f) REQUIRED GREENBELTS – ADDITIONAL PLANTING REQUIREMENTS: For
reasons of conflicting uses, unfavorable topography, or other unique or
extenuating physical circumstances, the Site Plan Review Committee or Planning
Commission may increase recommended landscape plantings in any required
green strip or greenbelt, if in its discretion an increase is found to be necessary to
reasonably achieve the intent of this chapter. In making such a determination,
the criteria of Section 18.07 (b) of the Zoning Ordinance shall be considered.
g) GREENBELTS – REDUCTIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS OF PLANTINGS: If a
physical hardship exists or existing topography and vegetation are determined by
the Committee or Planning Commission to provide equal or better landscape and
buffering effect, the Committee may approve modifications to the planting
recommendations of this document. The Committee or Planning Commission
may require such alternate plantings and visual screens as hedges, fences,
walls, and/or combination thereof which it deems necessary to ensure
compliance with the intent of this document and Section 18.07 (b) of the Zoning
Ordinance herein.

RESOLUTION NO. 12-37
AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLUTION SETTING ZONING AND LAND
DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION FEES AND ESTABLISHING AN ESCROW FUND
REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN ZONING AND LAND DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS
AND DEVELOPMENTS
WHEREAS, the Alpine Township Board of Trustees (the “Township Board”) desires to
establish certain application fees for zoning and other land development reviews and

require Alpine Township (the “Township”) to incur additional and at times extraordinary
out-of-pocket costs and expenses above and beyond what is associated with typical or

escrow fees be in addition to the fixed application fees and also be reasonably related and
proportionate to the costs incurred by the Township for the particular application or zoning
process involved, and that such fees and reimbursements be used to defray the costs of
administering and enforcing the Zoning Ordinance, the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, as
amended (MCL 125.3101 et seq.); the Alpine Township Land Division Ordinance, the

provided by the applicant to the Township Treasurer at the time of application. No
application shall be processed prior to the required escrow fee having been deposited
with the Township Treasurer. Any excess funds remaining in the Escrow Account after

Township's determination regarding these matters to the Township Board. All such
appeals shall be in writing and shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after the

Section 1.10 Reserved
Section 1.11 Enforcement, Violations, Penalties and Liabilities
(a) Enforcement. A discharger shall be guilty of a violation of this ordinance if such
person: (i) violates an order of the director (ii) fails to comply with any provision of this
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 13 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
ordinance (or permits issued hereunder or by the owner/operator of the sewage
treatment facility which treats the discharger’s effluent); or (iii) fails to comply with the
regulations or rules of the NKSA (the North Kent Sewer Authority Rules and
Regulations) for that portion of the system that flows into or is treated by the NKSA
sewage treatment facility. To the extent the rules, requirements and standards contained
in the ordinance differ from the rules, requirements and standards of the owner of the
sewage treatment facility where the sewage is treated, the stricter rules, requirements
and standards shall apply. Whenever the director finds that any user has violated, or is
violating, this ordinance, a significant industrial user discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the director may serve upon said
user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention thereof,
to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violation occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the NKSA or the Township to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b) Recovery of costs incurred by POTW. Any discharger violating any of the
provisions of this ordinance, or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a
deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the POTW or sewage treatment
facility, shall be liable to the Township and the entity incurring such loss, damage or
impairment for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. This
shall include, but not be limited to, penalties levied upon the POTW by the USEPA or
MDEQ for violation of its NPDES Permit caused by any violation by a discharger,
including all actual costs, court, attorney and other related legal fees plus an additional
charge of 100 percent of the total costs and/or penalties.
(c) Falsifying information. Any person or entity who knowingly makes any false
statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other
document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this ordinance, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required
under this ordinance, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided for in section 38-
182(a) of this ordinance.
(d) Suspension of service and discharge permits. The director may temporarily
suspend or permanently revoke the sewage disposal system service and/or the
significant industrial user discharge permit of a discharger when it appears that an actual
or impending discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the
health or welfare of persons, or the environment, interferes with the operation of the
POTW, violates any pretreatment limits, or conditions imposed by this ordinance
(including those established by the owner/operator of the sewage treatment facility) or
any significant industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant to this ordinance. Except
in the event of an emergency situation, before the director prohibits a person or entity
from discharging sewage into the POTW, the director shall provide the person or entity
with notice reasonably intended to apprise the user of the circumstances necessitating
such action and the anticipated length of time during which sewage may not be
discharged into the POTW. In the event of an emergency, notice shall be given as soon
thereafter as practical. Any discharger notified of the suspension of sewage disposal
system service and/or the discharger's significant industrial user discharge permit, shall,
within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the director, cease all discharges
and/or shut off the sewer connection to the POTW. In addition to or in lieu of the
discharger taking the necessary steps to cease all discharges, the director may take
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 14 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
whatever steps deemed necessary to eliminate the discharge, including prohibiting any
sewage from entering the POTW at its point of entry, or by shutting off a portion of the
POTW to one or more dischargers at any other location in the system, cessation of
Township water service, if applicable, and/or commencing judicial proceedings for
injunctive relief to compel the discharger's compliance with such order. The director may
reinstate the significant industrial user discharge permit and/or sewage disposal system
service and terminate any judicial proceeding upon presentation of proof by the
discharger of the elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the
threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
(e) Director's authority to issue administrative orders. Whenever the director
determines that any discharger has violated this ordinance, or any other applicable laws
or regulations which the Township is authorized to enforce, the director may issue
administrative orders of the type listed below, as deemed appropriate under the
circumstances. Multiple orders may be issued simultaneously or in combination as a
single order with respect to a single discharger.
(1) Cease and desist order. A cease and desist order directs the non-complying user
to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge
altogether. Any person, who uses, applies for use and/or is connected directly or
indirectly to the POTW shall be deemed to have consented to inspection pursuant to this
section including entrance upon the person's property by the director to take such steps
as necessary to eliminate the discharge should the discharger fail to comply with such
order. Such order shall be final and in effect until a hearing, if requested by the user, is
conducted and a final decision is made by the director. A written request for such
hearing shall be made within ten calendar days after receiving the order.
(2) Consent order. An agreement between the director and the user that may contain
compliance schedules, requirements for reimbursement of the Township for damages
and costs incurred or remedial actions, fines and administrative penalties, and
signatures of the director and the authorized representative. A consent order shall
address every identified and potential deficiency in the user's compliance status at the
time of the order.
(3) Show cause order. Where the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the
director may order any discharger who causes or allows prohibited conduct, to show
cause before the director why a proposed permit revocation action should not be taken.
A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service, or by certified
mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by
the director regarding the violations, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be
taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the discharger to show cause
before the director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of the discharger. The
proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the director who shall then enter
appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger.
Appeal of such order may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable state
law.
(4) Compliance order. A compliance order directs the discharger to achieve
compliance by a date specified in the order. Compliance orders require industrial users
to develop management practices, spill prevention programs and related POTW
industrial pretreatment program requirements.
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 15 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
(5) Stop work order. Where there is work in progress that constitutes causes or is
causing a violation of any provision of this ordinance, the director may issue a stop work
order to prevent further violations or damage.
(f) Director's authority to require financial assurances. Pursuant to the director's
authority to issue administrative orders, the director may require a non-complying
industrial or commercial user to post a performance bond sufficient to cover expenses
that might reasonably be incurred as a result of future violations. Industrial or
commercial users, who have, in the prior two years, been responsible for causing an
upset at the POTW, may be required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the
reasonable costs of restoring the POTW in the event of another such incident. These
requirements may be made conditions of the significant industrial user discharge permit.
(g) Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the director with respect to
the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provision of this ordinance, the Township
may, following the authorization of such actions by the director, commence a civil, civil
infraction or criminal action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the court of
competent jurisdiction. Such relief may include, but is not limited to, the following:
injunctive relief; suit for damages and costs to the NKSA, or the Township including legal
expense; municipal civil infraction actions and criminal prosecution seeking fines and
imprisonment as permitted by Section 1.12 of this ordinance and state law.
(h) Right of interpretation or ruling. Any discharger shall have the right to request, in
writing, an interpretation or ruling by the director on any matter covered by this ordinance
and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply.
(i) Operating upsets. Any discharger experiencing an upset in operations that places
the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this ordinance, or a significant
industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant hereto, shall inform both the director
and the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the sewage flows immediately
upon becoming aware of the upset. The director shall make a determination whether this
discharge can continue. Upon the director allowing the discharge to continue, a written
follow-up report thereof shall be filed within five days by the discharger with both the
director and the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the sewage flows. The
report shall include:
[1.] A description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact on a
discharger's compliance status;
[2.] The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and time of noncompliance,
and if noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to
occur; and
[3.] All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such
upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
(2) A documented and verified operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to any
enforcement action brought by the director against a discharger for any noncompliance
with this ordinance or any significant industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant
hereto, which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the
upset. It will not, however, be a defense to an action for damages to the POTW or to
persons, property or natural resources caused by the upset. An upset will be considered
"documented and bona fide" only if the discharger complies with subsection (a) above
and with 40 CFR 403.16(c) and rule 323.2315 of MAC. In any enforcement proceedings
the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(3) The user shall have controlled production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility, until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 16 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(4) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an operating upset shall
demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant
evidence that:
a. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
b. The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and appropriate manner
and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
c. The user notified the director immediately upon becoming aware of the upset; and
d. A written submission, containing the following information, was provided within five
days of commencement of the upset:
[1.] A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
[2.] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected,
the anticipated time the noncompliance was expected to continue; and
[3.] Steps taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
Section 1.12 Penalties
(a) Criminal and civil liability . (1) Except as provided in subsection (a)(3), any person
or entity in violation of this ordinance, or of any permit issued pursuant hereto or by the
owner/operator of the sewage treatment facility which treats a discharger’s effluent, or
standards, rules and regulations, any order of the director issued pursuant to those rules
and regulations or this ordinance, shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction
which the director is authorized to enforce citations pursuant thereto on behalf of the
Township. Each act of violation and every day upon which any violation is permitted or
suffered to exist shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to a separate
penalty. The director may issue a notice of violation prior to issuing a citation. In the case
of a conviction pursuant to this section of a discharger who is not a natural person, any
officer or director of a corporation, any officer or partner of a partnership, or any member
of a limited liability company, or any officer or owner of a proprietorship is hereby
deemed to be a proper person to serve any term of imprisonment imposed by the court
as a result of the conviction.
(2) In addition to, and expressly not in lieu of, the foregoing any discharger who violates
this ordinance, or any permit issued pursuant hereto, or the standards, rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to this ordinance, or any order of the director issued
pursuant to this ordinance, shall be subject to civil penalties, and to the payment of any
damages and costs which may be awarded, by any court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) In addition to any applicable state and federal penalties, any person who:
a. At the time of a violation knew or should have known that a pollutant or substance
was discharged contrary to any provision of this ordinance, or contrary to any notice,
order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the director
under this ordinance; or
b. Intentionally makes a false statement, representation, or certification in an
application for, or form pertaining to a permit, or in a notice, report, or record required by
this ordinance, or in any other correspondence or communication, written or oral, with
the POTW regarding matters regulated by this ordinance; or
c. Intentionally falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any sampling or monitoring

Adopted 02/15/2010
$500.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for up to 90 days, or both at the
discretion of the court.
Section 1.13 Record Retention
(a) Any person or entity subject to this ordinance shall retain and preserve, for no less
than three years, any and all books, drawings, plans, prints, documents, memoranda,
reports, correspondence and records related to compliance with this ordinance. This
includes, but is not limited to, records on magnetic or electronic media and any and all
summaries of such records, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis of
any discharge or other liquids discharged into the POTW.
(b) Any and all records which pertain to matters which are the subject of a notice of
violation, administrative order, show cause hearing, or any other enforcement or
litigation activities brought by the Township pursuant to this ordinance, shall be retained
and preserved for five years, or until all enforcement activities have concluded and all
periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired, whichever is later.
Section 1.14 Reserved
Section 1.15 User Charges
(a) Purpose of charges. Charges for the installation of, connection to and use of the
POTW shall be established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, repair, operation and replacement of the system. Such
charges shall be made in accordance with USEPA regulations. Rates and charges shall
be levied from time to time by resolution of the Township Board.
(b) Use charges. Rates and charges for sewage disposal service furnished by the
POTW shall be charged to all persons using the system. Such charges shall reasonably
reflect the proportionate costs of providing the service to the users of the POTW.
(c) Determination of user charges. The charges established shall be based upon the
water consumption of the user's premises, including water from public and private
supplies, as determined by this ordinance and the standards, rules and regulations
promulgated pursuant hereto. Where public water is not available, the Township shall, at
its sole option, estimate water sewage flow or require such metering as the Township in
its sole discretion may authorize. However, a monthly service charge shall be based
upon the size of the water meter. If a premises is served by both public water and a
private well (e.g. irrigation system), no water from the private well shall be allowed to
enter the POTW unless the director’s written approval is obtained and a method of
determining usage is in place.
Section 1.16 Rates and Charges
(a) Applicability. Users of the system shall pay rates and charges as established by
resolution of the Township Board. Such fees, rates and charges shall be designed to
produce revenues that are proportionate to the cost of providing service to each user
class of each customer class. Such cost may include but not be limited to operation,
maintenance, replacement, depreciation and capital costs of the system.
(b) Surcharges and permit fees. Fees and charges for a significant industrial user
discharge permit shall be determined by the operator of the sewage treatment facility to
which the sewage flows. Said sewage treatment facility may assess fees for analytical
testing which may be required as part of a significant industrial user discharge permit
and may also assess such other fees and charges within the lawful authority of said
sewage treatment facility.
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 18 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
(c) Enforcement. Delinquent bills due prior to July 1 shall be collected by adding them
to the winter tax rolls of the same year.
Section 1.17 Sewer Use Standards
(a) Sewer service applications and notification.
(1) A user desiring to obtain sewer service shall make application on forms prescribed by
the Township. In the event that sewer service at a premises is continuous through a
change of ownership, the new owner must file a notification of change of ownership
within ten days. Failure to complete an application or notification may result in
discontinuance of service.
(2) Whenever a condominium has a single sewer connection servicing the premises,
the account shall be made in the name of the condominium association. Sewer service
shall not be provided until the condominium association has filed with the Township
written proof that it has the authority to enter into such an agreement.
(b) Sewer lines.
(1) Oversizing shall mean the enlargement of a local collector sewer so that the
enlargement will serve as a trunk or interceptor sewer. When the system requires a local
collector sewer line to be oversized, it will pay the cost of such oversizing as computed
in the following manner:
a. In a residential assessment district or a new residential plot, the oversizing share is
the difference in the materials cost of the oversized sewer;
b. In a commercial, industrial or high density residential development assessment
district, the oversizing share is the difference in the materials cost of the oversized
sewer; and
c. In cases where the larger than normal size sewer line is required solely to provide
adequate service to a local service area and is not used as part of the larger network,
then the entire cost of the enlargement will be treated in the same manner as a normal
sized local collector line and the system will not participate in the oversizing cost.
(2) All new sewer lines shall conform to the standard specifications of the Township, or
its designee, for sanitary sewage collection systems and shall be a minimum of eight
inches in diameter in most areas. The director reserves the right to determine the
minimum acceptable sewer size in those cases where drainage problems exist or larger
size lines are warranted.
(c) Sewer laterals and appurtenances.
(1) The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and/or replacement at
his/her expense of his/her sewer lateral to insure continuous flow of sewage and be free
from infiltration from the structure to the local collector sewer.
(2) Whenever a sewer lateral is to be extended into the premises, the plumber or
contractor shall obtain location measurements from the Township or its designee.
However, the Township does not assume responsibility for the accuracy of such location
measurements.
(3) Every structure with plumbing fixture(s) shall have an independent, ownermaintained
building sewer lateral to the local collector sewer line when the system is
available. There shall not be more than one structure served by a single sewer lateral
connection, except upon approval of the director.
(4) When a structure is to be demolished, satisfactory arrangements shall be made with
the Township to disconnect and seal the sewer lateral at the property line or at the point
designated by the Township or its designee. The lateral disconnection shall be
inspected by the Township or its designee prior to sealing. Failure to make
arrangements for inspection and the proper termination of the connection shall cause the
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 19 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
director to order excavation of the lateral for the required inspection with all associated
costs to be the responsibility of the property owner.
(5) Unless specifically permitted by this ordinance, no person or entity shall cause or
permit any inflow, including but not limited to inflow from roof drains or footing drains, to
enter the POTW. The owner of the premises shall be responsible for any and all costs
associated with disconnections necessary to prevent inflow, and all costs including, but
not limited to, legal costs and inspection services required to enforce the provisions of
this ordinance.
(6) Basement waterproofing systems, i.e., systems within basements of structures
designed to intercept and collect groundwater that is leaking into said basements from
wall and or foundation cracks and intercepted and channeled away from said
basements, shall not be connected into the system – directly or indirectly. Captured or
channeled groundwater shall be discharged to a public or private storm drainage
system, where available, in such a manner as to not cause a public or private nuisance.
The director shall have the authority to inspect property where he has reason to suspect
a violation, upon reasonable notice to the property owner, and may order the owner to
discontinue the discharge of water from a basement waterproofing system.
(7) Disposal of garbage into the POTW shall be permitted only after it has been
pulverized by an installed food-waste-grinder unit. Such units shall be installed in
accordance with the then current plumbing code for the Township.
(d) Connection permits. Persons shall obtain a permit for sewer lateral connection from
the Township in accordance with the plumbing code for the Township or the State of
Michigan. Said permits shall be obtained before any such work may begin.
(e) Sewer connections.
(1) If at any time it is found that any sewer lateral connection has been installed
contrary to or in violation of this ordinance or rules or regulations governing such
installation, the director shall issue an order requiring compliance within 30 days after
notification. If compliance has not been obtained within 30 days of the notice, the
director may authorize termination of water/sewer service until the corrections are made.
The owner or user will not have redress for any such charges occurring because of shutoff
or termination. In addition, the violator may be subject to a municipal civil infraction
action.
(2) Each new sewer lateral installation, or repair of an existing sewer lateral, shall be
inspected and approved by the Township or its designee prior to backfilling.
(3) If a piece of property that has an existing sewer lateral serving more than one
building is subdivided into separate lots or parcels, then the owner of the building that
does not have direct sewer service must install his/her own sewer service across his/her
property or on an easement and the original sewer lateral to the adjoining sub-divided
property must be disconnected. Any required easements shall be recorded with the Kent
County Register of Deeds.
(4) Whenever a new sewer lateral is installed or repaired by a contractor or plumber, it
shall be guaranteed to be free from any defective material or poor workmanship, in the
public right-of-way, for a period of one year from the date of installation.
(5) Wastewater metering facilities may be installed by a user as required by the director
to measure sewage discharge from the user's premises to the sanitary sewer. All such
arrangements shall be made subject to acceptance by the director, and the expense
thereof, including the installation, maintenance and operation, shall be borne by the
user. Plans and specifications for the installation of any wastewater meter must be
Ordinance No. 10-02
Sewer Administration Ordinance
Page 20 or 29
Adopted 02/15/2010
submitted to the Township before actual installation begins. Such metering facilities shall
meet the following criteria:
a. A state licensed professional engineer must develop installation plans. Drawings of
the location of the primary measuring device and the meter, the location of the meter's
data output(s) and specifications for the meter, including its manufacturer, model and
logging frequency, must be included with the plans.
b. A plan location map, which accurately shows where the primary measuring device
and meter are located, shall be submitted as part of the drawings.
c. Meter reading provisions shall be convenient to any existing water meter reading
location.
(6) Underground structures and all associated piping that contain the primary
measuring device and the meter shall be installed in accordance with the plumbing code
for the Township.
(7) If possible, the primary measuring device must be located in an open or nonpermitted
confined space. The recording device may not be located in a confined space.
(8) The meter must include a data logger capable of recording and displaying
continuous flow data in 1,000 gallon units. The data must be inspected each business
day, by the user, with documentation of the inspection in the form of the inspector's
initials, date and time. All data records must be maintained for a minimum of three years
and be available for inspection by the director.
(9) The meter installation must be inspected and found to be acceptable by the director
before any data from the meter will be used for billing purposes.
(10) The user must maintain a meter service contract provided by the manufacturer or
the manufacturers approved representative. The meter shall be checked and calibrated
annually, or more frequently as required by the director, by the service provider. All
calibration records must be maintained for a minimum of three years and be available for
inspection by the Township.
(11) If failure of the meter occurs, the user must notify the director within one business
day. Repairs to the meter, which are the responsibility of the owner, must be completed
within five business days. If repairs cannot be completed within five business days, a
timetable for completion of repairs must be submitted to the director. If, as a result of
failure, or suspected failure, the sewer meter readings are in dispute, the volume of
water indicated by the water meter during the disputed time will be used as the
wastewater volume.
(12) At its discretion, the Township must be allowed to inspect the meter and all
records pertaining to the meter. At the director's discretion, the acceptance of any
wastewater metering device and/or data may be revoked.

ARTICLE VIII
GROUNDS AND PROCEDURE FOR A VARIAN CE
SECTION 8.1 GROUNDS FOR A VARIANCE. If the proprietor can clearly demonstrate
that literal enforcement of this Ordinance is impractical or will impose undue hardship in the use
of his land because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, the Township Board may permit
such variances as, in its sound discretion, it believed to be reasonable and within the general
purpose and policy of this Ordinance. A financial hardship or gain shall not of itself be
sufficient.
In making the findings required below, the Board shall consider the recommendations of the
Planning Commission, the location and condition of the proposed subdivision, the nature of the
proposed variance as compared with the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of
persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed
subdivisions and variances on traffic conditions, public health, and safety in the vicinity.
No variances shall be granted unless the Board finds that all of the following conditions exist:
There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use
of his land.
The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of
the applicant.
The granting of the variance will not be contrary to State or County regulations or Township
Ordinances, detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to other property in the area in which
said property is situated.
SECTION 8.2 PROCEDURE FOR A VARIAN CE. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the proprietor at the time when a preplat or the Preliminary Plat is filed
for consideration of the Planning Commission, or thereafter to meet any requirements of the
Planning Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the
facts relied upon by the petitioner. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation by •
the full majority vote to the Township Board upon any requested variance. Upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission that a variance be disapproved, the Township
Board may grant such variance upon the concurring vote of three members of the Township
Board.
ARTICLE IX
VALIDITY, ADMINISTRATION, AND ENFORCE1\1ENT
SECTION 9.1 ADMINISTRATION. This Ordinance shall be administered by the Township
Board. The rules, regulations, and standards imposed by this ordinance shall be considered to be
the minimum requirements for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the

given to these factors.
SECTION 9.2 VALIDITY. If any article, section, sentence, clause of phrase of this Ordinance
is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
remaining portions of this Ordinance.

TOWNSHIP OF ALPINE
COUNTY OF KENT, MICHIGAN
ORDINANCE NO. 01-06
{Effective Date: January 7, 2002)
AN ORDINANCE to provide for the regulation and control of storm water
runoff; to provide for storm water permits and the procedures and standards
for the issuance thereof; to provide for payment or reimbursement of costs
and expenses incurred by the Township associated with storm water permits
and the consideration thereof; to establish standards and requirements for
the protection of floodways and for the control of soil erosion and
sedimentation; to adopt other provisions forthe establishing, maintaining and
protection of drains and drainageways; to provide regulations for the
inspection, sampling and monitoring of storm water and other discharges; to
establish performance and design standards for storm water management
in specified zones of the Township; and to provide penalties for violations of
the ordinance.
THE TOWNSHIP OF ALPINE ORDAINS:
Article I - General
Sec. 1.01 Statutory Authority and Title
This ordinance is adopted in accordance with the Township Ordinance Act, as
amended, being MCL41.181, et seq.; the Township and Village Public Improvement
Act, as amended, being MCL41.721, et seq.; the Drain Code of 1956, as amended,
being MCL 280.1, et seq.; the Land Division Act, as amended, being MCL 560.1, et
seq.; the Revenue Bond Act, as amended, being MCL 141 .101, et seq.; the Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Act, as amended, being MCL 324.101, et
seq.; Section 401(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the
Clean Water Act), as amended, being 33 USC 1342(p) and 40 CFR Parts 9, 122,
123 and 124; and other applicable state and federal laws.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Alpine Township Storm ·
Water Ordinance.
Sec. 1.02 Findings
The Township finds that:
(1) Water bodies, roadways, structures, and other property within, and
downstream of the Township are at times subjected to flooding;
(2) Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a
danger to the natural resources of the Township and the region;
(3) Land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, resulting in
increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding,
increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and
deposition;
(4) Storm water runoff produced by land development contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants;
(5) Increases of storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution
have occurred as a result of land development, and cause deterioration of
the water resources of the Township and downstream municipalities;
(6) Storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution, due to land
development within the Township, have resulted in a deterioration of the
water resources of the Township and downstream municipalities;
(7) Increased storm water runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and
pollutants associated with storm water runoff from future development
projects within the Township will, absent reasonable regulation and control,
adversely affect the Township's water bodies and water resources, and those
of downstream municipalities;
(8) Storm water runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution can be
controlled and minimized by the regulation of storm water runoff from
development;
(9) Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this ordinance
and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of
storm water runoff;
(10) Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public
health, safety and welfare.
Sec. 1.03 Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to establish minimum storm water management
requirements and controls to accomplish, among others, the following objectives:
(1) To reduce artificially induced flood damage;
(2) To minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from identified
new land development;
(3) To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and bridges,
and other structures;
(4) To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable
conditions exist;
(5) To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution;
(6) To maintain the integrity of stream channels fortheir biological functions, as
well as for drainage and other purposes;
(7) To minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and streambed
stability;
(8) To reduce erosion from development or construction projects;

cause practical difficulties for a development or development site; provided,
however, that practical difficulties shall not include the need forthe developer
to incur additional reasonable expenses in order to comply with the
ordinance; and
(2) The granting of the relief requested will not substantially prevent the goals
and purposes sought to be accomplished by this ordinance, nor result in less
effective management of storm water runoff.
Article VII - Storm Water Easements and Maintenance Agreements
Sec. 7 .01 Applicability of Requirements
The requirements of this Article concerning storm water easements and
maintenance agreements shall apply to all persons required to submit a drainage
plan to the Township for review and approval.
Sec. 7 .02 Storm Water Management Easements
The developer shall provide all storm water management easements necessary to
implement the approved drainage plan and to otherwise comply with this ordinance
in form and substance required by the Township and shall record such easements
as directed by the Township. The easements shall be capable of being conveyed
to a County drainage district, assure access for proper inspection and maintenance
of storm water runoff facilities and provide adequate emergency overland flow-ways.
Sec. 7.03 Maintenance Agreements
The developer shall provide to the Township all storm water maintenance
agreements necessary to implement the approved drainage plan and to otherwise
comply with this ordinance in form and substance as required by the Township, and

Article VIII - Performance and Design Standards
Sec. 8.01 Performance Standards
In order to achieve the goals and purposes of this ordinance, the following three
storm water management zones (Zones A, Band C) are hereby established. The
Zones are shown on the map attached as Appendix A and made a part of this
ordinance.
(1) Zone A represents areas which require the most protective storm water
management regulations. The goal of this zone is to preserve the natural
condition of water bodies included in it, in whole or in part. Zone A has, in
general, little impervious surface area and few storm water facilities. In this
zone, when site conditions permit, infiltration of storm water runoff shall be
required, ratherthan the directed flow of storm water runoff into water bodies.
This storm water management practice provides greater protection for
surface water quality, and also assists in augmenting stream base flow,
reduction of flash storm flows and prevention of stream bank erosion.
Section 8.02 specifies design criteria for Zone A, in order that the volume and
rate of storm water runoff are controlled at predevelopment levels.
(2) Zone B represents developed areas that have significant impervious surfaces
and storm water runoff facilities in place. The goal of Zone B is the control
of storm water runoff in order to prevent further destabilizing of streams and
other water bodies. In this zone, the use of detention ponds, the
maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips and other measures to reduce
directly-connected impervious areas are specified in Section 8.02 for the
achieving of the storm water management standards applicable to Zone B.
The management practices for this zone are intended to maintain existing
water quality and to·alleviate adverse downstream impact on water bodies.
(5) Zone C consists of highly urbanized areas, or areas where there has been
significant modification of drainageways. The amount of impervious surface
area in Zone C is generally greaterthan 25%. Among the measures required
in Zone C, as stated in Section 8.02, are the use of sediment basins, the
maintenance and enhancement of buffer strips along water bodies and the
reduction of impeNious surface areas that are directly connected to water
bodies. An important element of storm water management practice in Zone
C is the control and prevention of sedimentation, in order to reduce pollution
of water bodies.
Sec. 8.02 Design Standards
The design standards for storm water runoff facilities for Zones A, B and C, as
described in Section 8.01, are the following:
Zone A Zone B ZoneC
Criteria High quality waters. Degraded physical, biological, Heavily degraded

Sec. 8.03 Resolution to Implement Performance and Design Standards
The Township Board may adopt a resolution establishing more detailed design and
performance standards for storm water runoff facilities, consistent with the terms of
this ordinance, and in order to further implement its goals and purposes.
