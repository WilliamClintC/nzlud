TOWN OF PAXTON STORM WATER BYLAW
Accepted May 6, 2006 (Amended May 6, 2019)


Introduction
Land uses in Town affect our streams, lakes and water supplies.  Careful planning of new development will protect the quality and health of these important water resources.  Therefore, the Town of Paxton enacts this Stormwater Bylaw to provide guidance that will prevent harmful impacts from land development activities.

1.0	PURPOSE
A.)  The purpose of this Bylaw is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing requirements and procedures to manage stormwater runoff, promote groundwater recharge and to prevent water pollution from new development and redevelopment.  This Bylaw seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:  

1.	Establish regulations for land development activities that preserve the health of water resources; 

2.	Require that the amount and quality of stormwater from new development is equal to or better than pre-development conditions in order to reduce flooding, stream erosion, pollution, property damage and harm to aquatic life; 

3.	Establish stormwater management standards and design criteria to control the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff; 

4.	Encourage the use of  “low impact development practices”, such as reducing impervious cover and preserving greenspace and other natural areas;  

5.	Establish maintenance provisions to ensure that stormwater treatment practices will continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; 

6.	Establish procedures for the Town’s review of stormwater management plans and for the Town’s inspection of approved stormwater treatment practices. 

B)	Nothing in this Bylaw is intended to replace the requirements of the Town of Paxton Flood Plain Zoning Bylaw, or any other Bylaw that may be adopted by the Town of Paxton.  Any activity subject to the provisions of the above-cited Bylaws must comply with the specifications of each.

2.0	DEFINITIONS 
Definitions are in Appendix A of this Bylaw and shall apply in the interpretation and implementation of the Bylaw.  Terms not defined in this Appendix shall be understood according to their customary and usual meaning. Additional definitions may be adopted by separate regulation. 

3.0	AUTHORITY  
This Bylaw is adopted under authority granted by the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution, and pursuant to the regulations of the federal Clean Water Act, and as authorized by the residents of the Town of Paxton at Town Meeting, dated May 6, 2006. 

4.0	ADMINISTRATION
A)	The Stormwater Authority, shall administer, implement and enforce this Bylaw.  Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Stormwater Authority may be delegated in writing by the Stormwater Authority to its employees or agents.  

B)	Stormwater Regulations. The Stormwater Authority may adopt, and periodically amend, rules and regulations relating to the terms, conditions, definitions, enforcement, fees (including application, inspection, and/or consultant fees), procedures and administration of this Stormwater Bylaw by majority vote of the Stormwater Authority, after conducting a public hearing to receive comments on any proposed revisions.  Such hearing dates shall be advertised in a newspaper of general local circulation, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing date.  After public notice and public hearing, the Stormwater Authority may issue rules and regulations to fulfill the purposes of this Bylaw. Failure by the Stormwater Authority to issue such rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this Bylaw. 

C)	Stormwater Management Manual.  The Stormwater Authority will utilize the policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards of the latest edition of the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy, to execute the provisions of this Bylaw.  This Policy includes a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria for each. The Policy may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring, and local maintenance experience. Unless specifically altered in the Stormwater Regulations, stormwater management practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to be protective of Massachusetts water quality standards.

D)   Actions by the Stormwater Authority.  The Stormwater Authority may take any of the following actions as a result of an application for a Stormwater Management Permit:  Approval, Approval with Conditions, Disapproval, or Disapproval without Prejudice.

E)	Appeals of Action by the Stormwater Authority.  A decision of the Stormwater Authority shall be final.  Further relief of a decision by the Stormwater Authority made under this Bylaw shall be reviewable in the Superior Court in an action filed within [60 days] thereof, in accordance with M.G.L. Ch. 249 § 4.

F)	Stormwater Credit System. The Stormwater Authority shall adopt, through the Regulations authorized by this Stormwater Management Bylaw, a Stormwater Credit System.  This credit system will allow applicants the option, if approved by the Stormwater Authority, to take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices to reduce some of the requirements specified in the criteria section of the Regulations.  Failure by the Stormwater Authority to issue such a credit system through its Regulations or a legal declaration of its invalidity by a court shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this Bylaw.

5.0	APPLICABILITY
A)	This bylaw shall be applicable to all new development and redevelopment, including site plan applications and subdivision applications as well as any illicit discharges.  The Bylaw shall apply to any activities that will result in an increased amount of stormwater runoff or pollutants from a parcel of land, or that will alter the drainage characteristics of a parcel of land, unless exempt under Section 5.C of this Bylaw.  All new development and redevelopment under the jurisdiction of this Bylaw shall be required to obtain a Stormwater Management Permit.   

B)	An alteration, redevelopment, or conversion of land use to a hotspot such as: auto salvage yards, auto fueling facilities, fleet storage yards, commercial parking lots with high intensity use, road salt storage areas, commercial nurseries and landscaping, outdoor storage and loading areas of hazardous substances, or marinas, shall require a Stormwater Management Permit.

C)	Exemptions

No person shall alter land within the Town of Paxton without having obtained a Stormwater Management Permit (SMP) for the property with the following exceptions:

1.   Any activity that will disturb an area less than 10,000 square feet or less than 25% of a contiguous property, whichever is less.

Prior to land disturbance activities, persons constructing single-family dwellings are strongly encouraged to consult with the Town Superintendent of the Department of Public Works about actions to reduce stormwater impacts during and after construction. It is also recommended that individuals constructing single-family dwellings prepare and grade lots in such a manner that development of the lot does not cause detrimental drainage on another lot or onto streets either during construction or upon completion. Persons constructing single-family dwellings are strongly encouraged to use stormwater control and site planning methods described in the Town of Paxton Best Development Practices Guidebook.

7.   Repair or replacement of an existing septic system. Persons repairing or replacing septic systems are strongly encouraged to consult with the Town Board of Health about actions to
	reduce stormwater impacts during and after construction.

Not withstanding any other provision of this bylaw, no person or entity shall dump, discharge, cause, or allow to be discharged any pollutant or non-storm water discharge into any pipe, drain, catch basin, or other structure in the MS4 such that it discharges into MS4, a water body, or a wetland resources area, whether by direct or indirect connection.  No person shall construct, use, allow, maintain, or continue any illicit connection to the MS4, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under applicable law, regulation, or custom at the time of construction.  No person or entity shall discharge, cause, or allow to be discharged any septage or septic tank or cesspool overflow in the MS4.  

The Storm Water Authority or designee will investigate all suspected illicit discharges into the MS4 and take immediate action to seek out the responsible party.  


6.0	PROCEDURES
Permit Procedures and Requirements shall be defined and included as part of any rules and regulations issued as permitted under Section 4 of this Bylaw.

7.0	ENFORCEMENT
The Stormwater Authority or its designee shall enforce these Regulations, and may pursue all remedies for violations, including a written enforcement order.  

If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the enforcement order shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed.  
Where elimination is not possible within 60 days of source confirmation, a schedule for its elimination will be set for no more than 180 days.  Said order shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated government agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.

8.0	SEVERABILITY
The invalidity of any section, provision, paragraph, sentence, or clause of this Bylaw shall not invalidate any section, provision, paragraph, sentence, or clause thereof, nor shall it invalidate any permit or determination that previously has been issued. 
 
APPENDIX A	DEFINITIONS

ALTER:  Any activity, which will measurably change the ability of a ground surface area to absorb water or will change existing surface drainage patterns.  Alter may be similarly represented as “alteration of drainage characteristics,” and “conducting land disturbance activities.”

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP):  Structural, non-structural and managerial techniques that are recognized to be the most effective and practical means to prevent and/or reduce increases in stormwater volumes and flows, reduce point source and nonpoint source pollution, and promote stormwater quality and protection of the environment.  “Structural” BMPs are devices that are engineered and constructed to provide temporary storage and treatment of stormwater runoff.  “Nonstructural” BMPs use natural measures to reduce pollution levels, do not require extensive construction efforts, and/or promote pollutant reduction by eliminating the pollutant source.

BETTER SITE DESIGN:  Site design approaches and techniques that can reduce a site’s impact on the watershed through the use of nonstructural stormwater management practices.  Better site design includes conserving and protecting natural areas and greenspace, reducing impervious cover, and using natural features for stormwater management. 

DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS: The addition from any source of any pollutant or combination of pollutants into the MS4. 

HOTSPOT:  Land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, such as auto salvage yards, auto fueling facilities, fleet storage yards, commercial parking lots with high intensity use, road salt storage areas, commercial nurseries and landscaping, outdoor storage and loading areas of hazardous substances, or marinas.

ILLICIT CONNECTION: A surface or subsurface drain, conduit, or conveyance that allows an illicit discharge to enter the MS4, including without limitation sewage septage, process wastewater, or wash water, and any connection from indoor drains, sinks, or toilets, regardless of whether said connection was permissible under applicable law, regulation, or custom at the time of construction. 

ILLICIT DISCHARGE: A discharge that is not entirely comprised of storm water. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an illicit discharge does not include discharges from the following activities or facilities: firefighting, water line flushing, landscape irrigation, uncontaminated ground water, potable water sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, footing drains, individual resident car washing, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated water from swimming pools, water used from street washing and water used to clean residential buildings without detergents.  These exemptions will not apply if the permittee, EPA, or MassDEP identifies such discharge as a significant contributor of pollutants to the MS4.

MASSACHUSETTS STORM WATER MANAGEMENT POLICY:  The Policy issued by the Department of Environmental Protection, and as amended, that coordinates the requirements prescribed by state regulations promulgated under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act G.L. c. 131 § 40 and Massachusetts Clean Waters Act G.L. c. 21, §. 23-56. The Policy addresses stormwater impacts through implementation of performance standards to reduce or prevent pollutants from reaching water bodies and control the quantity of runoff from a site.

MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4): The system of conveyances designed or used for collecting or conveying storm water, including any road with a drainage system, street, gutter, curb, inlet, piped storm drain, pumping facility, retention or detention basin, natural or manmade or altered drainage channel, reservoir, and other drainage structure that together comprise the storm drainage system owned or operated by the Town of Paxton.  

NEW DEVELOPMENT: Any construction or land disturbance of a parcel of land that is currently in a natural vegetated state and does not contain alteration by man-made activities. 

NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION: Pollution from many diffuse sources caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into water resource areas.

SECTION 4.  DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS

4.1	Basic Requirements

No building or other structure in any district shall be constructed which does not conform to the Dimensional Requirements as set forth in this Section 4 of this Bylaw. In Paxton, no building shall exceed two and one-half (2½) stories in height.

4.2	Schedule of Dimensional Requirements

The following table entitled “Schedule of Dimensional Requirements” with its accompanying footnotes shall be a part of this Bylaw.

4.2.1	Substantial Irregularity: No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new construction on a lot which is substantially irregular in shape. A lot having a Regularity Factor of less than 0.4 as determined by the following formula is considered to be Substantially Irregular:

R = 16A	Where:	R = Regularity Factor
P2	A = Land Area (in square feet)
	P = Perimeter of the Lot (in feet)

The Planning Board may, by special permit, authorize new construction on a lot with a Regularity Factor of less than 0.4 if it finds that the proposed application will not have a detrimental impact on abutters or the neighborhood, cause a traffic or safety hazard, or have a negative impact on the environment.

Example: A rectangular lot with dimensions of 200' by 300' contains an area of 60,000 square feet and a perimeter of 1000'. Using the formula above an R factor of 0.96 results:

R = 16A	=	R = 16 X 60,000	=	960,000	=	0.96
P2	10002	1,000,000

4.5.1	Purpose: The purpose of the Paxton Watershed Protection Overlay District is: (i) to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community; (ii) to protect, preserve, and maintain the existing water supply within the Town; (iii) to conserve the natural resources of the Town; (iv) to protect the groundwater areas of the Town from adverse development or land use practices; and (v) to prevent blight and pollution of the environment.  The provisions of this Bylaw are subject to federal law and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the extent of any conflict between such laws and this Bylaw, such laws shall control.

4.5.2	Establishment and Delineation of the Paxton Watershed Protection Overlay District

1.	There is hereby established within the Town a Paxton Watershed Protection Overlay District (the “Watershed Protection District”) consisting of an area which impacts the reservoirs owned and/or controlled by the Town of Paxton and/or the City of Worcester, which are located within the Town boundaries, including without limitation, portions of the watersheds of Asnebumskit Pond, Pine Hill Reservoir, Kettle Brook Reservoirs Nos. 2, 3, and 4, Lynde Brook Reservoir, and Holden Reservoirs Nos. 1 and 2, (The “Protected Areas”). The land within the Watershed Protection District hydrologically flows to the Protected Areas and is the basis for the need for the zoning protections.

2.	The boundaries of the Watershed Protection District are set forth on a map entitled “Watershed Protection District, Paxton, Massachusetts,” dated September 10, 2001 prepared by Marin Environmental (the “Plan”), which is on file in the office of the Town Clerk.

Chapter 40A, Sec. 5. The Plan shows a Zone I and Zone II.

3.	Due to the scale of the Plan there may be small inaccuracies in the delineation of the Watershed Protection District. Where there is some dispute as to where the boundary lies on a particular property, the Building Commissioner or his designee and the landowner shall conduct an on-site investigation to determine where the boundary lies. If the Building Commissioner and the landowner cannot agree as to the location of the boundary, the burden of proof shall be with the landowner to provide the Town with information from any individual, professionally registered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Board of Registration as a registered land surveyor, licensed environmental engineer, or other qualified individual satisfactory to the Building Commissioner showing where the boundary lies. Boundary lines may only be altered in accordance with M.G.L. Chapter 40A, Sec. 5.

The Board shall cause notice of such hearing to be published and sent to parties in interest as provided in Section 6.2.7 of this Bylaw, and shall notify the Planning Board of Paxton and the Planning Boards of adjacent cities and towns which may forward recommendations with respect to said matter for the consideration of the Board of Appeals. At such hearing, all of the following prerequisite must be proved by the petitioner or appellant to the Board’s satisfaction in order for the Board to give consideration to the granting of such Variance. Failure to prove one or more of the prerequisites will defeat the petition or appeal. Such prerequisites are:

1.	Owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape or topography of the land or structures in question, and especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant; and
2.	Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good; and
3.	Desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this Bylaw.

In granting a Variance, the Board of Appeals may impose conditions, safeguards and limitations both of time and use, including the continued existence of any particular structure but excluding any condition, safeguards or limitation based upon the continued ownership of the land or structures to which the Variance pertains by the petitioner or any other owner.

Under this Bylaw, no Variance may be authorized by the Board of Appeals for a use or activity not otherwise permitted by Right in the zoning district in which the land or structure is located; provided, however, that such variances properly granted prior to the effective date of this amended Bylaw but limited in time, may be extended on the same terms and conditions that were in effect for such variance upon said effective date.

The decision of the Board of Appeals shall be made within one hundred (100) days after the date of filing of a petition or appeal under this section. Failure of the Board to act within said one hundred (100) days shall be deemed to be the grant of petition or appeal sought, subject to an applicable judicial appeal as provided for in Chapter 40A. The required time limits for a public hearing and said action may be extended by written agreement between the applicant and the Board of Appeals. A copy of such agreement shall be filed by the applicant with the Town Clerk.

If the rights authorized by a Variance are not exercised within one year of the date of granting of such Variance, they shall lapse and may be reestablished only after notice and a new hearing pursuant to this Section 6.2.6.

6.2.6 (a)	Findings: Subject to the provisions of Section 1.5.1, the Board of Appeals, after a public hearing, may grant a Finding by a majority vote to allow the change, alteration or extension of a pre-existing nonconforming structure or use provide the Board decides that the proposed change, alteration, or extension of the nonconforming use or structure shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use or structure.

2.	if the structure height is between thirty-five and forty-five feet (35’-45’), the antennas do not project higher than forty-five feet (45’).

3.	if the structure height is thirty-five feet (35’) or less, the antennas do not project higher than ten feet (10’) above the existing structure.

8.5.4	Height, Existing Structures, (Utility): New antennas located on electric transmission and distribution towers, telephone poles and similar existing utility structures shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this Bylaw provided that there is no more than an increase of ten feet (10’) in the height of the existing structure as a result of the installation of a personal wireless service facility.

8.5.5	Height, Wireless Facility Overlay District: In the wireless facility overlay district, personal wireless service facilities of up to two hundred fifty feet (250’) feet in height may be permitted by special permit. Monopoles are the preferred type of mount for such taller structures. Such structures shall comply with all setback and special permit regulations set forth in this Bylaw.

8.6	Facility and Site Design Criteria

8.6.1	Setbacks: All personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall comply with the building setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located. In addition, the following setbacks shall be observed:

1.	In order to ensure public safety, the minimum distance from the base of any ground-mounted personal wireless service facility to any property line, road, habitable dwelling, business or institutional use, or public recreational area shall be two times the height of the facility/mount, including any antennas or other appurtenances, or five hundred feet (500’), whichever is less. This setback is considered a "fall zone".

2.	In the event that an existing structure is proposed as a mount for a personal wireless service facility, a fall zone shall not be required, but the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the case of pre-existing non-conforming structures, personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall not increase any non-conformities, except as provided in section 8.6.1.3 below.

3.	In nonresidential districts, the Board of Appeals may grant a special permit to allow a lesser setback if it makes a finding that such lesser setback provides adequate safety, promotes co-location or improves design, and will not negatively impact the appearance and character of the neighborhood.

8.6.2	Shelters and Accessory Buildings: Equipment boxes or shelters for personal wireless services equipment must either be interior to the building on which it is located, completely camouflaged, and/or completely screened from view from the public way. Equipment shelters shall be camouflaged behind an effective year-round landscape buffer, equal to the height of the proposed building, and/or wooden fence. The Board of Appeals shall determine the style of fencing and/or landscape buffer that is compatible with the neighborhood.

8.6.3	Signs: A sign not larger than one square foot shall be posted adjacent to the entry gate indicating the name of the facility owner(s) and a 24-hour emergency telephone number. Each carrier located on site shall also provide a sign with the same information. Advertising on any antenna, tower, fencing, accessory building or communication equipment shelter is prohibited.

8.6.4	Lighting: Unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), no exterior night lighting of towers or personal wireless service facilities is permitted except for manually operated emergency lights for use when operating personnel are on site. Where the FAA does require lighting, the ZBA may impose a condition in its special permit decision that the applicant indicate a preference to the FAA of a particular type, color, or manner of lighting that the ZBA believes will minimize light or visual impact on the neighborhood and Town.

8.6.5	New Towers: Any new freestanding tower shall be of a monopole construction unless the applicant demonstrates in the special permit process that other tower designs are necessary to provide adequate coverage within the Town. 

8.6.6	Screening: All personal wireless services equipment shall be sited, screened and/or painted or otherwise colored or finished to blend in with the building or structure on which it is mounted or in a manner which aesthetically minimizes the visibility of the devices in the surrounding landscape or on the building or structure to which they are attached. In certain circumstances, additional architectural features or changes to the façade may be necessary to maintain the balance and integrity of the design of the building or structure with building mounted personal wireless services equipment. The Board of Appeals shall determine the measures needed to screen or integrate the equipment and antennas into the existing landscape and adjacent properties and buildings.

8.6.7	Vegetation: If personal wireless service facilities are not camouflaged from public viewing areas by existing buildings or structures, they shall be surrounded by buffers of dense tree growth and understory vegetation in all directions to create an effective year-round visual buffer. Ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall provide a vegetated buffer of sufficient height and depth to effectively screen the facility. Trees and vegetation may be existing on the subject property or installed as part of the proposed facility or a combination of both. The Board of Appeals shall determine the types of trees and plant materials and depth of the needed buffer based on site conditions.

8.6.8	Security: The area around the personal wireless service facility shall be completely secure from trespass or vandalism. At a minimum, fencing shall be provided to control access to towers serving personal wireless service facilities and shall be compatible with the scenic character of the Town.

8.6.9	Parking: There shall be a minimum of one parking space for each facility, to be used in connection with the maintenance of the facility and the site, and not to be used for the permanent storage of vehicles. This shall not apply to any location upon an existing Town-owned structure.

8.6.10	Connections: To the extent technologically feasible, all network interconnections from the facility shall be via underground lines.

8.6.11	Noise: Ground-mounted equipment for personal wireless service facilities shall not generate noise in excess of ten (10) dBA above the ambient sound level between 7:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. based on measure-ments taken at the property line.

8.6.12	Fuel: Only propane fuel may be used and stored on site.

8.6.13	Projection from Existing Structure: Side-mounted and structure-mounted antennas shall not project more than two feet (2’) horizontally from the building or structure.

8.6.14	Redundant Safety Measures: In all cases where the public is allowed within the fall zone of a personal wireless service facility, additional measures shall be taken to insure the public is protected from falling debris related to normal operation of the facility (as in falling ice) or structural failure of any mounting system. Examples of such measures include, but are not limited to, designing a screen wall to support any falling items behind it, cabling antennas and mounting systems to a second anchor point, and  providing ice shields above pedestrian areas.

 
8.7	Justification of Need

8.7.1	Coverage Area: The applicant shall provide a map of the geographic area in which the proposed facility will provide adequate coverage.

8.7.2	Adequacy of Other Facility Sites Controlled by the Applicant: The applicant shall provide written documentation of any facility sites in the Town and in abutting Towns or cities in which it has a legal or equitable interest, whether by ownership, leasehold or otherwise. Said documentation shall demonstrate that these facility sites do not already provide, or do not have the potential to provide by site adjustment, adequate coverage.

8.7.3	Capacity of Existing Facility Sites: The applicant shall provide written documentation that it has examined all facility sites located in the Town and in abutting Towns in which the applicant has no legal or equitable interest to determine whether those existing facility sites can be used to provide adequate coverage.

8.7.4	Adequate Coverage Through the Least Disruptive Means: The applicant shall provide written documentation that the proposed facility uses the least disruptive technology (through the use of repeaters or other similar technology as it may be developed subsequent to adoption of this Bylaw) in which it can provide adequate coverage in conjunction with all facility sites listed above.

10.9	Preservation of Affordability; Restrictions on Resale
Each affordable unit created in accordance with this Bylaw shall have the following limitations governing its resale. The purpose of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability to qualified purchasers in perpetuity. The resale controls shall be established through a deed rider or an affordable housing restriction as defined by M.G.L. c.184, Section 31, recorded at the Worcester District Registry of Deeds or the Land Court, and shall be in force for as long a period as is lawful. The affordable housing use restriction shall meet the requirements of the LIP Program.
10.9.1	Resale Price: Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall include the initial discount rate between the sale price and the unit’s appraised value at the time of resale. This percentage shall be recorded as part of the restriction on the property noted in Section 10.9. For example, if a unit appraised for $300,000 is sold for $225,000 as a result of this Bylaw, it has sold for 75% of its appraised value. If, several years later, the appraised value of the unit at the time of proposed resale is $325,000, the unit may be sold for no more than $243,750, or 75% of the appraised value of $325,000. All future sales shall be to a Qualified Affordable Housing Unit Purchaser as defined in section 10.2.2.
10.9.2	First Refusal to Purchase: The purchaser of an affordable housing unit shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by the Town. This instrument shall grant the Town a right of first refusal for a period not less than the maximum period allowable under guidelines set by DHCD for Local Initiative Units. The Town may opt to purchase the property or assignment thereof, in the event that, despite diligent efforts to sell the property, a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located.
10.9.3	Rental Prohibition: The Planning Board shall require, as a condition of subdivision approval, that the deeds to the affordable housing units contain a restriction against renting or leasing said unit during the period for which the housing unit contains a restriction on affordability.
10.9.4	Deed Restrictions: The Planning Board shall require that the applicant comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of the deed rider noted in Section 10.9 The Building Commissioner shall not issue an occupancy permit for any affordable unit until the deed restriction is recorded at the Worcester District Registry of Deeds or the Land Court.
10.10	Fees in Lieu of Affordable Housing Units
As an alternative to Section 10.4.1 through 10.4.3, an applicant may contribute a cash payment to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, or other special, dedicated account, to be used for the development of affordable housing by the Town or its designees, in lieu of constructing and offering affordable units within the locus of the proposed development or off-site.
10.10.1	Calculation of Fees-In-Lieu of Units: The applicant may pay a fee in-lieu of the construction of affordable units. The fee shall be an amount equal to the sale price of an affordable housing unit to a qualified purchaser making eighty percent (80%) of the median income for a four-person household for the Worcester PMSA.
1.	The methodology used to determine an affordable purchase price shall comply with LIP Program guidelines in effect at the time of application for approval of a residential subdivision.
2.	The assumptions used to determine an affordable purchase price, including but not limited to minimum down payment, mortgage interest rate, term, closing and other costs shall be consistent with first-time homebuyer mortgage products available from commercial lending institutions located in or serving Paxton at the time of application for subdivision approval.
3.	The applicant shall present to the Planning Board and the Building Commissioner a written certified receipt, issued by the Town Treasurer, as evidence of payment of the appropriate fee to the Town.

Paxton Planning Board 40 Subdivision Regulations
4.2.3 Access from Public Ways
4.2.3.1 Where the street system within the proposed subdivision does not intersect with or have, in the opinion of the Planning Board, adequate access from an existing public way that has sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction, the Board shall require, as a condition of approval, that such adequate access be provided by the Applicant, and/or that the Applicant make physical improvements to and within such existing or proposed way of access in accord with the design and construction requirements of these Rules and Regulations, from an appropriate street within a subdivision to the nearest public way most suitable in terms of width, grade and construction.
4.2.3.2 Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the subdivider to dedicate a strip of land along its frontage for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to a width a least commensurate with that required within the subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within such public way to the same standards required within the subdivision. Such strip shall not be used in the calculation of lot area and yard setbacks. Any such dedication of land for purpose of way and any such work performed within such public way shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne by the subdivider.

1. Purpose and Intent
The purposes of this bylaw are to preserve and enhance the community character and value of real property and further the goals and policies of the Town of Paxton Open Space and Recreation Plan by: Allowing greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments; encouraging the permanent preservation of open space, including agricultural and forest lands, water resources, wildlife habitat, and historical and archaeological resources; encouraging a less sprawling, more economical form of development that conforms to natural features; and by minimizing the total amount of disturbance on the site.
2. Definitions
For purposes of this bylaw, the following terms shall have the following definitions:
Basic Maximum Number – The number of units that would be allowed on a site using the standard Zoning Bylaw Provisions and/or Subdivision Rules and Regulations as determined by a Conventional Yield Plan.
Hard (Conventional) Stormwater Management Techniques – Structural stormwater management techniques including, but not limited to, catch basins, subsurface piping, stormwater inlets, and subsurface leaching facilities. These techniques generally require heavy infrastructure and often result in significant alteration of the site hydrology.
Major Residential Development-Any new subdivision, as defined in Chapter 44, §§ 81K-81GG, of the general laws, that will create more than four (4) residential lots.
Soft Stormwater Management Techniques – Non-structural stormwater management techniques that use passive surface pre-treatment of stormwater in conjunction with decentralized recharge to achieve a low impact design that attempts to mimic predevelopment hydrologic conditions to the greatest practicable extent.
3. Applicability
A. A Major Residential Development may be permitted only upon an issuance of a Special Permit from the Planning Board. The Planning Board may issues a Major Residential Special Permit to allow either a Conventional Development or an Open Space Residential Development (“OSRD”), in accordance with this Bylaw. Applicants for a Major Residential Development shall submit both a conventional plan and an OSRD plan in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Bylaw.

D. Other Information. The submittals and permits of this section shall be in addition to any other requirements of the Subdivision Control Law or any other provisions of this Zoning Bylaw. To the extent permitted by law, the Planning Board shall coordinate the public hearing required for any application for a Special Permit for Conventional or a Major Residential Development Special Permit with the public hearing required for approval of a Definitive subdivision plan.
6. Design Process
At the time of the application for the Special Permit, in conformance with Section 5.A., applicants are required to demonstrate to the Planning Board that the following Design Process was performed by a multidisciplinary team of which one member must be a certified Landscape Architect and considered in determining the layout of proposed streets and house lots, including designation of all common areas and open space.
A. Identifying Conservation Areas. Identify preservation land by two steps. First, Primary Conservation Areas (such as wetlands, riverfront areas, and floodplains regulated by state or federal law) and Secondary Conservation Areas (including unprotected elements of the natural landscape such as steep slopes, mature woodlands, prime farmland, meadows, wildlife habitats and cultural features such as historic and archaeological sites and scenic views) shall be identified and delineated. Second, the Potentially Developable Area shall consist of land outside identified Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas.
B. Locating House Sites. Locate the approximate sites of individual houses within the Potentially Developable Area and include the delineation of private yards and shared amenities, so as to reflect an integrated community.
C. Aligning the Streets and Trails. Align streets in order to access the house lots or units. Additionally, new trails should be laid out to create internal and external connections to existing and/or potential future streets, sidewalks, and trails.
D. Lot Lines. Draw in the lot lines.
7. Design Standards for an OSRD Project
The following Generic and Site Specific Design Standards shall apply to all Sketch Plans for OSRD’s and shall govern the development and design process:
A. Generic Design Standards.
(1) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of the
{H:\PA\LU\06953\01001\A1070381.DOC [Ver: 2]}
neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual building sites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover. Topography, tree cover, surface water buffers, and natural drainage ways shall be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot configuration rather than as malleable elements that can be changed to follow a preferred development scheme.
(2) Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve natural topography, significant landmarks, and trees; to minimize cut and fill; and to preserve and enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel.
(3) All open space (landscaped and usable) shall be designed to add to the visual amenities of the area by maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or overlooking it from nearby properties.
(4) The removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures, or architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable, whether these exist on the site or on adjacent properties.
B. Site Specific Design Standards.
(1) Housing Type. An OSRD Project shall consist of single-family structures.
(2) Parking. Each dwelling unit for single or two-family homes shall be served by two (2) off-street parking spaces. Parking spaces in front of garages may count in this computation. For dwelling units with fewer than two bedrooms, the applicant shall provide one and a half (1.5) parking spaces per unit. Calculations for parking spaces in these developments shall be rounded up to the nearest integer where necessary. The Planning Board may modify these requirements during the review process in response to conditions specific to an individual proposal.
(3) Drainage. The Planning Board shall encourage the use of Soft Stormwater Management Techniques and other Low Impact Development techniques that reduce impervious surface and enable infiltration where appropriate.
(4) Screening and Landscaping. All structural surface stormwater management facilities shall be accompanied by a conceptual landscape plan.
(5) On-site Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation. Walkways, trails and bicycle paths shall be provided to link residences with recreation
{H:\PA\LU\06953\01001\A1070381.DOC [Ver: 2]}
facilities (including parkland and open space) and adjacent land uses where appropriate.
(6) Disturbed Areas. Every effort shall be made to minimize the area of disturbed areas on the tract. A disturbed area is any land not left in its natural vegetated state.
8. Open Space Requirements for an OSRD Project
A. Open Space Requirement. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the site shall be open space. Within the open space designated to meet the open space requirement, the area that is upland shall not be less than fifty percent (50%).
B. Description of Restriction on Open Space. Any proposed open space, unless conveyed to the Town or its Conservation Commission, shall be subject to a permanent Conservation or Agricultural Preservation Restriction in accordance with G.L. c. 184 § 31, approved by the Planning Board and Board of Selectmen/Town Council and enforceable by the Town, conforming to the standards of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, Division of Conservation Services, or Department of Agricultural Resources. Such land shall be perpetually kept in an open state, shall be preserved exclusively for the purposes set forth herein, and shall be maintained in a manner which will ensure its suitability for its intended purposes. Any proposed open space that does not qualify for inclusion in a Conservation Restriction or Agricultural Preservation Restriction or that is rejected from inclusion in these programs by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall be subject to a Restrictive Covenant, which shall be approved by the Planning Board and Board of Selectmen/Town Counsel and enforceable by the Town.
(1) The open space shall be contiguous. Open Space will still be considered contiguous if it is separated by a roadway or an accessory amenity. The Planning Board may waive this requirement for all or part of the required open space where it is determined that allowing noncontiguous open space will promote the goals of this bylaw and/or protect identified primary and secondary conservation areas.
(2) The open space shall be used for wildlife habitat and conservation and the following additional purposes: historic preservation, outdoor education, passive recreation, aquifer protection, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, a combination of these uses, and shall be served by suitable access for such purposes. The Planning Board may permit a small portion of the open space to be paved or built upon for structures accessory to the dedicated use or uses of such open space (i.e., pedestrian walks and bike paths) so long as it supports the primary and secondary purposes of the OSRD and is consistent with state and local level environmental protections.
{H:\PA\LU\06953\01001\A1070381.DOC [Ver: 2]}
(3) Wastewater and stormwater management systems serving the OSRD may be located within the open space. Surface systems, such as retention and detention ponds, shall not qualify towards the minimum open space required.
C. Restrictions in or Title to the Open Space. The open space shall, at the Planning Board’s election, be conveyed to or subject to Conservation Restriction(s) to be held by:
(1) The Town or its Conservation Commission;
(2) A qualified nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space and any of the purposes for such open space set forth above;
(3) A corporation, homeowners association or trust owned jointly or in common by the owners of lots within the OSRD. If such corporation or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with conveyance of the lots in perpetuity. Maintenance of such open space and facilities shall be permanently guaranteed by such corporation or trust which shall provide for mandatory assessments for maintenance expenses to each lot. Each individual deed, and the deed or trust or articles of incorporation, shall include provisions designed to effect these provisions. Documents creating such homeowners association, trust or corporation shall be submitted to the Planning Board for approval, and shall thereafter be recorded.
(4) A private owner for agricultural, horticultural or forestry.
D. Maintenance of Open Space. In any case where open space is not conveyed to the Town, the Town shall be granted an easement over such land sufficient to ensure its perpetual maintenance as conservation or recreation land. Such easement shall provide that in the event the trust or other owner fails to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, the Town may, after notice to the lot owners and public hearing, enter upon such land to maintain it in order to prevent or abate a nuisance.
9. Reduction of Dimensional Requirements for an OSRD Project
Applicant may propose to modify lot size, building placement, shape, and other dimensional requirements for lots within an OSRD, subject to the following limitations:
A. Frontage. Lots having reduced area or frontage shall not have frontage on a street other than a street created by the OSRD; provided, however, that the Planning Board may waive this requirement where it is determined that such reduced lot(s) will further the goals of this bylaw. The minimum frontage may be reduced from the frontage otherwise required in the zoning district; provided, however, that no lot shall have less than 50 feet of frontage.
{H:\PA\LU\06953\01001\A1070381.DOC [Ver: 2]}
B. Setbacks. Every dwelling fronting on the proposed roadways shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the roadway right-of-way, and 10 feet from any rear or side lot line. In no event shall structures be closer than 30 feet to each other.
10. Decision of the Planning Board
A. Criteria for Approval. The Planning Board will review all data and hold a public hearing on an application for a Major Residential Development in accordance with M.G.L. c.40A, section 9. Prior to the close of the public hearing, the Planning Board shall recommend the development plan (either the Yield Plan showing Conventional Development or the Sketch Plan showing OSRD), that it considers the most beneficial to the Town. Within seven days, the Applicant shall then elect which plan he wishes to pursue and communicate this choice in writing to the Board, prior to the close of public hearing. The Board may approve such plan or Special Permit with or without conditions. The Board shall disapprove an application for a Special Permit only if it finds that either the Conventional Development (Conventional Yield Plan) or the OSRD Development (Sketch Plan) is not a good faith design, or that the Plan that the Applicant elects to pursue does not conform to the requirements of this Bylaw. The Board may grant a Special Permit for an OSRD if it determines that the proposed OSRD has less detrimental impact on the tract than a conventional subdivision of the property and finding that the following eight (8) factors are satisfied:
(1) That the OSRD achieves greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential or unit developments than a conventional plan;
(2) That the OSRD promotes permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land, forestry land, other natural resources including water bodies and wetlands, and historical and archaeological resources;
(3) That the OSRD promotes a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features better than a conventional subdivision;
(4) That the OSRD reduces the total amount of disturbance on the site;
(5) That the OSRD furthers the goals and policies of existing community planning documents including, but not limited to, the Open Space and Recreation Plan;
(6) That the OSRD facilitates the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities, and public services in a more economical and efficient manner;
(7) That the Concept Plan and its supporting narrative documentation complies with all sections of this zoning bylaw.
{H:\PA\LU\06953\01001\A1070381.DOC [Ver: 2]}
(8) That the proposed design does not create undo risk to public health, safety and welfare.
B. Relationship between Concept Plan and Definitive Subdivision Plan. Any application for Special Permit for a Major Residential Development must be followed by the submittal of a Definitive Subdivision plan in accordance with the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the Town. The OSRD Special Permit shall be reconsidered if there is substantial variation between the Definitive Subdivision Plan and the Concept Plan. If the Planning Board finds that a substantial variation exists, it shall hold a public hearing on the modifications to the Concept Plan. A substantial variation shall be any of the following:
(1) An increase in the number of building lots and/or units;
(2) A significant decrease in the open space acreage;
(3) A significant change in the lot layout or unit placement;
(4) A significant change in the general development pattern which adversely affects natural landscape features and open space preservation;
(5) Significant changes to the stormwater management facilities; and/or
(6) Significant changes in the wastewater management systems.
11. Severability
If any provision of this bylaw is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the bylaw shall not be affected thereby. The invalidity of any section or sections or parts of any section or sections of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the town’s zoning bylaw.
and
II. To amend the “Use Schedule” found in subsection 3.2 of Section 3 of the Zoning Bylaw, by inserting a new line under part 3.2.2 “Residential” after line number 8, to read as follows:
“9) A new subdivision that will create more than four (4) residential lots (see Section 10).”
and inserting the designation “SP” under the associated columns for all Zoning Districts (GRB, GRA and B);
or act in any way thereon.
