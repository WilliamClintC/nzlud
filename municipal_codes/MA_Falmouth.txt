Demolition Delay
[Adopted AFTM 11-14-2006, Art. 53,13 approved 3-6-2007]
§ 107-1. Intent and purpose.
This bylaw is enacted for the purpose of preserving and protecting
significant buildings within the Town which constitute or reflect distinctive
features of the architectural, cultural, economic, political or social history of
the Town and to limit the detrimental effect of demolition on the character
of the Town. Through this bylaw, owners of significant buildings are
encouraged to seek out alternatives to demolition that will preserve,
rehabilitate or restore such buildings, and residents of the Town are alerted
to impending demolitions of significant buildings. By preserving and
protecting significant buildings, and the streetscapes and neighborhoods
they form, this bylaw makes the Town a more attractive and desirable place
in which to live and work. To achieve these purposes and thereby promote
the public welfare, the Historical Commission is authorized to advise the
Building Commissioner with respect to demolition permit applications. The
issuance of demolition permits is regulated as provided by this bylaw.
§ 107-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings

APPLICANT — Any person or entity who files an application for, or a request
for review of demolition relative to, a demolition permit. If the applicant
is not the owner of the premises upon which the building is situated, the

the application.
APPLICATION — An application for the demolition of a building.
BUILDING — Any combination of materials forming a shelter for persons,
animals, or property.

immediately, or at a specific time, or upon fulfillment of specified conditions
by the applicant, if the Commission deems such a waiver to be in the best
interests of the Town and in pursuit of the purpose of this article. Upon

Purpose and intent. It has been determined that certain businesses and/
or individuals on Cape Cod and the Islands are possessing and selling
certain substances which when ingested produce intoxicating effects
similar to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or marijuana. These substances,
which are described herein, are often used as an alternative synthetic
to marijuana and are potentially dangerous to users and society, and the
long-term effects are not yet known. The effects of these substances are
a health concern to the citizens of Falmouth. Not all of the substances
are categorized as illegal controlled substances under state or federal
law. By selling these legal substances for smoking and ingestion in the
guise of incense, the manufacturers avoid the United States Food and
Drug Administration process for study and approval of such prior to
distribution for consumption. In addition, by marketing such incense
products directed at the controlled drug subculture, the manufacturers
and sellers avoid the schedule implications of the Controlled
Substances Act.16 There is currently no legitimate purpose for such
synthetic chemicals contained therein.
A.
Prohibited activities.
It shall be unlawful for any person to possess, sell, barter, give,
publicly display for sale; attempt to possess, sell, barter, or give; or

quantity of synthetic marijuana or synthetic marijuana analogue.
(1)
This article shall apply regardless of whether the synthetic
marijuana or synthetic marijuana analogue is described as tobacco,
herbs, incense, spice, bath salts, plant food or any blend thereof,
and, regardless of whether the substance is marketed for the
purpose of being smoked or ingested, and, regardless of whether
the substance is marked "not for human consumption."

B.
Exceptions.
It is not an offense under this article if the person was acting at
the direction of the Falmouth Police Department and its officers, or
federal or state law enforcement, to enforce or ensure compliance
with this article prohibiting the sale of the aforementioned
substances.

New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area
§ 180-37. Public health emergency.
Because of high ground water, high density of development, significant
numbers of failed septic systems, groundwater contamination, recreational
water contamination and the inability of property owners to meet the
requirements for Title V septic systems, there presently exists a public
health emergency in the area designated by Town Meeting, Article 19,
Annual Spring Town Meeting, April, 1997, as the New Silver Beach Sewer
Service Area.
§ 180-38. Mandatory connection.
The owner of any house, building or property located in the New Silver
Beach Sewer Service Area which is used for human occupancy,
employment, recreation or other purpose is hereby required, at his expense,
to install suitable toilet facilities therein, including appliances required by
§ 180-48, and to connect such facilities directly with the public sewer in
accordance with this chapter and the provisions contained herein, within
ninety (90) days from the date the sewer shall be declared ready for
operation by the Board of Selectmen. Any new construction occurring
within the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area after such date shall
be properly equipped with suitable toilet facilities and connected with the
sewer prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
§ 180-39. Limited treatment capacity.
The treatment plant for the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area is
designed with limited capacity. The design capacity is capable of properly
treating the effluent of all existing lots in the district and the North
Falmouth School provided that each residence is limited to a maximum of
three (3) bedrooms plus allowance for residences in existence with more
than three bedrooms as reflected in the Assessor's records as of January
1, 1999. A bedroom is defined in 310 CMR 15.002, Title V Regulations,
and includes that circumstance where the total number of rooms for singlefamily
dwellings exceeds eight (8), not including bathrooms, hallways,
unfinished cellars and unheated storage areas, the number of bedrooms
presumed shall be calculated by dividing the total number of rooms by two
(2) then rounding down to next lowest whole number.
§ 180-40. Allocation of treatment capacity.
Each single-family residence in the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area
is presumed to have three (3) bedrooms. Residences with less than three
(3) bedrooms may be expanded to three (3) bedrooms as a matter of right
§ 180-37 SALES, SPECIAL § 180-40

relative to sewer capacity. No residence may be expanded beyond three (3)
bedrooms unless the owner shall first obtain a variance pursuant to this part
of the chapter. New construction is limited to three (3) bedrooms.
§ 180-41. Existing residences.
Any residence in existence on January 1, 1999, regardless of its number
of bedrooms, as determined by the Assessor's records, may maintain that
number of bedrooms without regard to the three-bedroom limitation.
Further expansion of existing residences beyond three (3) bedrooms as
defined herein shall not be allowed unless a variance pursuant to § 180-46
is first obtained.
§ 180-42. Undeveloped parcels.
For the purposes of sewer capacity any existing lot, otherwise qualified, may
be permitted for a three-bedroom single residence. Pursuant to MGL c. 41
§ 81U, the Board of Health shall disapprove a definitive plan of subdivision
of property within the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area unless and
until the applicant shall first obtain a variance pursuant to § 180-46. Without
an approved variance, any approval by the Planning Board shall be on
condition that no building or structure shall be built or placed upon the
areas designated without benefit of a variance in accordance with § 180-46.
§ 180-43. Transferability of development rights.
The size of a residence or number of bedrooms on any particular parcel of
land cannot be sold, exchanged, transferred or otherwise used to benefit
another's right to connection or the number of bedrooms on another lot.
§ 180-44. Multiple-family and nonresidential uses.
Any multiple-family or nonresidential use legally in existence on January
1, 1999, may maintain its current level of activity, as measured by water
consumption, as a matter of right. Any expansion of such multiple-family
or nonresidential use cannot occur unless the owner or operator shall
first obtain a variance pursuant to § 180-46. No new multiple-family or
nonresidential use may be commenced unless the owner or operator shall
first obtain a variance pursuant to § 180-46.
§ 180-45. Properties outside of the New Silver Beach Sewer Service
Area.
Because of the limited treatment capacity, properties located outside of the
New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area, with the exception of the North
Falmouth School for which specific capacity was included in the treatment
facility, that abut a sewer line may not, as of right, connect to the sewer.
In cases of unusual hardship, not owing to the acts or omissions of the
property owner, and with the permission of the Board of Selectmen after
a public hearing and provided the Board of Selectmen shall first make
a specific finding that adequate treatment capacity exists, such owner
§ 180-40 FALMOUTH CODE § 180-45
176:222
whose property is outside the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area may
connect to the sewer. Any costs associated with such connection are the
responsibility of the individual seeking the connection.
§ 180-46. Variances.
In case of unusual and substantial hardship, not the result of acts or
omissions of the landowner, the Board of Selectmen, after a public hearing
of which notice has been given by publication and posting for a minimum
of two (2) weeks, may grant a variance to this part of the bylaw, provided
that sufficient capacity exists and such relief may be granted without
substantially derogating from the intent of purpose of this bylaw.
§ 180-47. Rebuilding because of fire, flood, storm or other acts of
nature.
Relating to this chapter, a property owner may rebuild a structure destroyed
by fire, flood, storm or other acts of nature as a matter of right provided that
the new structure does not exceed the number of bedrooms of the structure
being replaced.

Flow Neutral Bylaw for Present and Future Sewer Service Areas. This
bylaw shall apply to all present sewer service areas of the Town, except for
the New Silver Beach Sewer Service Area, governed by §§ 180-37 through

[Adopted AFTM 11-18-2014, Art. 31, approved 2-19-2015]
§ 191-21. Purpose and intent.
The production and use of single-use plastic bags have significant impacts
on the marine and land environment of all coastal communities, including
but not limited to: contributing to the potential death of marine and
terrestrial animals through ingestion and entanglement; contributing to
pollution of the land and coastal environment; clogging our storm drainage
systems; creating a burden to our solid waste collection and recycling
efforts; and requiring the use of millions of barrels of nonrenewable,
polluting, fossil fuel nationally for their manufacture. Therefore, the Town
of Falmouth seeks to phase out the use of single-use plastic bags by all retail
establishments over a period of eighteen (18) months from the effective
date of this article.19
The purpose of this legislation is to phase out the usage of single-use
checkout bags by all retail establishments and take-out restaurants in the
Town of Falmouth.
§ 191-22. Definitions.
ESTABLISHMENT — Any business selling goods, articles, food or personal
services to the public, including take-out restaurants.

Customers are encouraged to bring their own reusable shopping bags to
stores. Establishments may provide reusable bags at no charge, or charge a
reasonable fee for each paper or other bag, as they desire. Establishments
are strongly encouraged to make reusable bags available for sale to
customers at a reasonable price.

The production and use of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam, also known
as Styrofoam®, has significant impacts on the marine and land environment
of all coastal communities, including but not limited to: contributing to
the potential death of marine and terrestrial animals through ingestion;
contributing to pollution of the land and coastal environment; clogging
storm drainage systems; creating a burden to solid waste collection by
acting as a major contaminant in curbside recycling; and requiring the use
of millions of barrels of nonrenewable fossil fuel for manufacture.
With the goal of protecting the health of its citizens and the unique natural
beauty and irreplaceable natural resources of the Town of Falmouth, and
given that inexpensive, safe alternatives to expanded polystyrene (EPS)
foam are easily obtained, the Town will phase out the use of expanded

connection to any customer's premises, the Utilities Manager or his
delegated agent shall give notice, in writing, to said customer to install
an approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to his
premises. The customer shall, within 90 days, install such approved device
or devices at his own expense, and failure or refusal or inability on the
part of the customer to install said device or devices, within 90 days, shall
constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until
such device or devices have been properly installed.
To protect the public potable water supply served by the Falmouth
Water Department (hereinafter referred to as "Department") from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating, within its
customers' internal distribution system, such contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the public water

unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which
a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to
ensure satisfactory operation.
(2)
The Department shall inform the owner by letter of any failure to
comply by the time of the first reinspection. The Department will
allow an additional 15 days for the correction. In the event that
the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time
of the second reinspection, the Department will inform the owner
by letter that the water service to the owner's premises will be
terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In the event that
the owner informs the Department of extenuating circumstances as
to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be

B.
§ 223-15 WATER § 223-15
223:297
§ 223-16. Degree of hazard.
The Department recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard
and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention devices or double check valves.
§ 223-17. Existing in-use backflow prevention devices.
Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Department to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in
the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment,
any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure
principle device or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in
the event that no backflow device was present.
§ 223-18. Periodic testing.
that the device fails to operate correctly and second reinspections
for noncompliance with Department or DEP requirements.
Reduced pressure principle backflow devices shall be tested and
inspected at least semiannually.

Periodic testing shall be performed by the Department's certified tester
or his delegated representative. This testing will be done at the owner's
expense.

The testing shall be conducted during the Department's regular
business hours. Exceptions to this policy, when at the request of the
owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to
the Department.
C.
Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion
of the repair, the device will be retested at the owner's expense to
ensure correct operation. High-hazard situations will not be allowed
to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date
of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The
owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools or a replacement
device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the
owner ensuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair
of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such
continuity.
D.
Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in Subsection A above in cases where there is a history of
test failures and the Department feels that, due to the degree of hazard

General Provisions
§ 240-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to lessen congestion in the streets; to
conserve health; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other dangers;
to provide adequate light and air; to prevent overcrowding of land; to avoid
undue concentration of population; to encourage housing for persons of all
income levels; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water
supply, drainage, schools, parks, open space and other public requirements;
to conserve the value of land and buildings, including the conservation
of natural resources and the prevention of blight and pollution of the
environment; to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the
Town, including consideration of the recommendations of the Master Plan, if
any, adopted by the Falmouth Planning Board and the Comprehensive Plan,
if any, of the Cape Cod Planning and Economic Development Commission;
and to preserve and increase amenities, pursuant to Chapter 40A, 40B and
41 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, and Article 89 of the
Amendments to the Constitution.
§ 240-2. Applicability of other laws.
This chapter is supplementary of other laws and bylaws affecting the use,
height and area of buildings and structures and the use of the premises.
Where this chapter or any portion thereof imposes a greater restriction than
is imposed by other regulations, permits, easements, covenants or other
provisions of law or bylaws, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 240-2.1. Exempt uses. [Added STM 10-2-1990, Art. 4, approved
1-9-1991]
This chapter shall not prohibit, regulate or restrict the use of the land
or structures for religious purposes or for educational purposes on
land owned or leased by the commonwealth or any of its agencies,
subdivisions or bodies politic or by a religious sect or denomination
or by a nonprofit educational corporation. However, such land or
structures shall be subject to the regulations concerning the bulk and
height of structures, yard sizes, lot area, setbacks, open space, parking
and building coverage requirements found in the Falmouth Zoning
Bylaw, unless, by special permit, the Planning Board grants relief from
these dimensional regulations as applied to exempt uses, subject to the
criteria set forth in Article XLII.
A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such regulations shall apply to any
structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the first
notice of a public hearing on this provision, provided that construction
commences within six months after the issuance of the permit and
is thereafter continued through to completion as continuously and
expeditiously as is reasonable, provided further, however, that if such
B.
§ 240-1 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-2.1
235:335
§ 240-3. Preexisting structures and uses.
building permit is renewed, such six-month period shall be extended
for the renewal periods, but not more than 12 additional months, and
provided further that no design changes occurring after the initial
issuance of the building permit shall increase the intensity of the
development of the building to which the building permit relates.
Except as hereinafter provided, this chapter shall not apply to
structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a
building or special permit issued before the date of the first publication
of notice of the public hearing on such bylaw required by MGL C.
40A, § 5. Anything to the contrary in the zoning bylaw notwithstanding,
the residential use of two or more dwellings on a single lot shall
be deemed a preexisting nonconforming use if commenced prior to
May 19, 1959, and may only be altered, extended or modified by
special permit pursuant to this section provided the Board of Appeals
finds through a preponderance of credible evidence that said use
commenced prior to May 19, 1959, and has not been abandoned or not
used for a period of two years or more. In approving any alteration,
extension or modification the Board of Appeals shall require that the
number of dwelling units shall be limited to the same as in existence
on May 19, 1959. [Amended ATM 4-5-2010, Art. 9, approved
7-14-2010]
A.
Noncomplying structures 10 years or older. In accordance with MGL
C. 40A, § 7, a structure, which has not been in compliance with this
chapter, or with the conditions set forth in any special permit or
variance affecting the structure, for a period of 10 years or more
from the commencement of the violation may not be the subject of
any enforcement action by the Town to compel the removal, alteration
or relocation of such structure. Structures which qualify under MGL
C. 40A, § 7, are considered to be nonconforming structures and are
entitled to treatment as such as provided in this section. [Added ATM
4-3-1990, Art. 18]
B.
Preexisting, nonconforming structures or uses may be extended,
altered or changed only by special permit from the Board of Appeals.
Any such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use
or structure. [Amended STM 10-7-1986, Art. 66]
Recognizing the need to provide some guidelines for determining
relative detrimentality, and recognizing there are basic and
consistent principles of zoning which are broadly accepted, the
following standards shall apply to the granting of a special permit:
(a) The standards of § 240-216.
The change or alteration of the structure or use may be
allowed as maintaining or lessening any nonconformity without
(b)
(1)
C.
§ 240-2.1 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-3
235:336
having to meet existing dimensional requirements. However,
the extension of a structure may be considered a detriment
after the Board of Appeals considers whether the extension
extends or creates a new dimensional nonconformity, impairs
views or vistas or does not reasonably conform to the average
dimensions found in the neighborhood.
Where the proposed use is regulated by other sections of
this chapter, the applicable standards of those sections shall
also be considered in determining whether the proposal is
substantially more detrimental.
(c)
Exempted from the requirement for a special permit are the
following:
Alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change
(collectively "alteration") to a nonconforming single- or twofamily
residential structure shall not be considered an increase
in the nonconforming nature of the structure and shall be
permitted by right under the following circumstances:
[Amended ASTM 4-4-1994, Art. 9, approved 7-9-1994]
Normal repairs or replacement of parts of any
nonconforming structure, provided that such repair or
replacement does not constitute an extension of a
nonconforming use of such structure.
[1]
Alteration to a conforming structure where the alteration
will also comply with all applicable sections of the zoning
bylaws in effect at the time of application, if the existing
structure is located on a lot which is nonconforming as the
result of a zoning change.
[2]
Alteration within the existing footprint of a nonconforming
structure to comply with requirements of the
Massachusetts Building Code.
[3]
Alteration to a nonconforming structure where the
alteration will comply with all applicable sections of the
zoning bylaws in effect at the time of application and will
not increase the habitable space.
[4]
Alteration to a nonconforming structure on a lot of at least
20,000 square feet, where the alteration will comply with
all applicable sections of the zoning bylaw in effect at the
time of application, including, but not limited to setback,
yard, building coverage and height requirements.
[5]
In cases where the applicant seeks to increase the height
of any structure that encroaches on a required setback,
where any increase in height will occur within such
[6]
(a)
(2)
§ 240-3 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-3
235:337
encroachment, there shall be no alteration as of right
under this section.
Interior alteration of any otherwise conforming structure
which does not change the nature of, nor increase the intensity
of, a nonconforming use, and interior alterations of preexisting
nonconforming structures for a use or uses which are
otherwise allowed by zoning. [Amended STM 10-7-1986,
Art. 66]
(b)
Reconstruction of a legally nonconforming structure damaged
or destroyed by fire or other accidental or natural cause, other
than flood damage sustained to structure within Zones A and
V Floodplains shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps of
Falmouth, if the reconstruction is substantially the form it
had at the time of damage or destruction, or in any form if
within applicable setback requirements and not larger than
previously, and if reconstruction is started within 24 months
and completed within 36 months of the damage or destruction.
[Added ATM 4-4-1979, Art. 102; amended STM
10-7-1986, Art. 66]
(c)
Reconstruction of any permitted commercial accommodation
structure or unit(s), if for the purpose of rehabilitation,
upgrade, and if the commercial accommodation was licensed
and operational for the three years prior to the rehabilitation
upgrade. The reconstruction will not allow rebuilding at a
greater density, greater height or at a different location than
previously existed. [Added ATM 4-7-1982, Art. 53]
(d)
Not exempted under this subsection are accessory uses and
structures. [Added STM 10-7-1986, Art. 66]
(e)
Any nonconforming use which has been abandoned or not used for two
years or more loses the protection of Subsection A and shall be required
to conform to the current bylaw. [Amended STM 10-14-1987, Art.
49; AFTM 11-17-1992, Art. 2, approved 2-3-1993]
D.
Residential use amnesty. Within three years from the effective date of
this bylaw, an owner of a lot with one or more structures containing
dwelling units which do not comply with the Zoning Bylaw may apply
for a special permit to establish such units as lawfully nonconforming
where the Board of Appeals determines by a preponderance of credible
evidence that such noncompliance has been continuous since January
1, 1994, without any lapse for a period of two years or more; the
provisions of § 240-216 shall also apply. [Added ATM 4-7-2014, Art.
8, approved 5-13-2014]

§ 240-4. Previously issued permits. [Amended AFTM 11-6-2017, Art.
14, approved 2-12-2018]
Construction or operation under a building permit or special permit must
conform to any subsequent amendments of this chapter unless the use
or construction is commenced within a period of twelve months after the
issuance of the permit and in cases involving construction, unless such
construction is continued through to completion continuously and
expeditiously.
§ 240-5. Existing structures. [Added ATM 4-7-1981, Art. 42]
Any residential structure in existence as of January 1, 1970, not protected
by § 240-3, will be deemed to be conforming to the dimensional
requirements of these bylaws, but any alteration, reconstruction, extension
or structural change must conform to the current bylaw dimensional
requirements.
shall accompany the special permit application and any repairs
or upgrades determined as necessary shall be a condition of the
special permit;
Any special permit issued under this amnesty program shall also
provide:
That the subject property shall be served by the municipal
sewer or an on-site waste disposal system that conforms to the
State Sanitary Code as determined by the Health Department;
(a)
As a condition of the special permit, a deed restriction,
covenant or other suitable instrument, acceptable to and
enforceable by the Town, shall be recorded with the land
records that restricts the leasing of any dwelling unit(s)
allowed by this special permit, beyond the units allowed by
right in the particular zoning district, to households with an
income 80% or less of the Barnstable County median income as
determined by the most recent federal census or other method
acceptable to the Board of Appeals and further at a gross
annual rent not to exceed 30% of the median income herein
described. The property owner shall provide to the Board of
Appeals documentation that certifies the income level and rent
paid by the tenant on a yearly basis;
(b)
The number of units allowed by this special permit may not
exceed those in existence for at least 20 years without a lapse
of two years or more, and no subsequent modification of the
special permit shall allow additional units or conversion to a
nonresidential use;

of Appeals shall take into consideration the combined effects of each use
on the property and determine whether such combination is in harmony
with the general intent of this bylaw utilizing the criteria of Articles XXII,
XXIII, XXIV and XLII. This section shall not be construed to prohibit any
property owner from conducting a use allowed by right in the zoning district
provided that any existing use approved by special permit on the same lot is
abandoned. Any additional use for which a special permit is required shall
be subject to the standards in this section with respect to review of the

Purpose. The intent of the Accessory Apartment bylaw is to:
broaden the range of housing choice in Falmouth by increasing
the number of small dwelling units available for rent; encourage
greater diversity of population with particular attention to young
adult citizens and to allow for "aging in place" for our senior
citizens; promote more economic and energy efficient use of the
Town's housing supply. All this while maintaining the appearance
and character of the Town's single-family neighborhoods.

Definitions.
ACCESSORY APARTMENT — Sections 240-3A, 240-66D and
240-70D notwithstanding, an additional dwelling unit, subordinate
in size and accessory to the principal dwelling unit on the lot,
located in either the principal dwelling or an accessory structure
on the lot. An accessory apartment is constructed so as to maintain
(2)
I.
§ 240-23 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-23
235:364
the appearance and essential character of a single-family dwelling
or accessory structure thereto located on the lot.
Requirements.
(a) Only one accessory apartment shall be allowed per lot.
(b) The lot size shall be no less than 7,500 square feet.
Either the principal dwelling or accessory apartment must be
owner-occupied for a period of seven months in every calendar
year, or owned by a nonprofit organization or government
authority whose purpose is to provide affordable housing.
(c)
Either the principal dwelling or accessory apartment may be
rented, but not both. The owner occupied dwelling cannot be
rented while owner is absent. Rental periods shall be no less
than six months and weekly/monthly rentals (so-called summer
rentals) are expressly prohibited. Neither the principal
dwelling nor accessory apartment shall be used as commercial
accommodations at any time.
(d)
The accessory apartment shall have no more than two
bedrooms and a maximum of 800 square feet, or 40% of the
principal dwelling, whichever is less, as measured using the
exterior side of the first floor outside wall. Plus as follows:
finished attic space, 50% of first floor; finished half story, 75%
of first floor; three-quarter story (gambrel), 90% of first floor;
second floor colonial, 100% of first floor; and third floor

An existing dwelling in excess of four bedrooms may convert
two of the existing bedrooms into one accessory unit.
(g)
The total number of bedrooms on the lot shall not exceed
four when the lot contains less than 20,000 square feet. A
property that has a preexisting bedroom count that exceeds
four bedrooms per 20,000 square feet of lot area can maintain
that number of current bedrooms but cannot increase.
(h)
Whether allowed as a matter of right or by special permit,
accessory apartments located on lots subject to the provisions
of the Water Resource Protection or Coastal Pond Overlay
Districts, the total number of bedrooms shall not exceed one
per 10,000 square feet of lot area. Properties that preexist with
a density greater than one bedroom per 10,000 square feet
in a Coastal Pond Overlay District can maintain their existing
bedroom count but cannot increase.

An accessory apartment constructed within an existing singlefamily
dwelling or an existing accessory structure attached
thereto: Prior to the issuance of a building permit for an
accessory apartment constructed within a single-family
dwelling or accessory structure attached thereto, a Site Plan

the principal dwelling or accessory apartment has been owneroccupied
for a period of seven months and not otherwise
rented as set forth in Subsection I(3)(c) above. The Building
Commissioner may allow a property owner to be absent during
this seven-month period for cause, such as military
assignment, work- or health-related issues, academic
sabbatical or similar circumstance.
(a)

Enforcement.
Upon a written determination by the Building Commissioner
that the property owner has failed to comply with these
provisions the property owner shall bring the accessory
apartment into compliance within 90 days of such notice.

Purpose. The intent of the Accessory Apartment bylaw is to:
broaden the range of housing choice in Falmouth by increasing
the number of small dwelling units available for rent; encourage
greater diversity of population with particular attention to young
adult citizens and to allow for "aging in place" for our senior
citizens; promote more economic and energy efficient use of the
Town's housing supply. All this while maintaining the appearance
and character of the Town's single-family neighborhoods.
(1)
Definitions.
ACCESSORY APARTMENT — Sections 240-3A, 240-66D and
240-70D notwithstanding, an additional dwelling unit, subordinate
in size and accessory to the principal dwelling unit on the lot,
located in either the principal dwelling or an accessory structure
on the lot. An accessory apartment is constructed so as to maintain
the appearance and essential character of a single-family dwelling
or accessory structure thereto located on the lot.
(2)
Requirements.
(a) Only one accessory apartment shall be allowed per lot.
(b) The lot size shall be no less than 7,500 square feet.
Either the principal dwelling or accessory apartment must be
owner-occupied for a period of seven months in every calendar
year, or owned by a nonprofit organization or government
authority whose purpose is to provide affordable housing.
(c)
Either the principal dwelling or accessory apartment may be
rented, but not both. The owner occupied dwelling cannot be
rented while owner is absent. Rental periods shall be no less
than six months and weekly/monthly rentals (so-called summer
rentals) are expressly prohibited. Neither the principal
dwelling nor accessory apartment shall be used as commercial
accommodations at any time.
(d)
The accessory apartment shall have no more than two
bedrooms and a maximum of 800 square feet, or 40% of the
principal dwelling, whichever is less, as measured using the
exterior side of the first floor outside wall. Plus as follows:
finished attic space, 50% of first floor; finished half story, 75%
of first floor; three-quarter story (gambrel), 90% of first floor;
second floor colonial, 100% of first floor; and third floor
colonial, 100% of first floor.
(e)
The footprint of a new detached accessory dwelling unit cannot
exceed that of the principal dwelling.
(f)
(3)
§ 240-38 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-38
235:382
An existing dwelling in excess of four bedrooms may convert
two of the existing bedrooms into one accessory unit.
(g)
The total number of bedrooms on the lot shall not exceed
four when the lot contains less than 20,000 square feet. A
property that has a preexisting bedroom count that exceeds
four bedrooms per 20,000 square feet of lot area can maintain
that number of current bedrooms but cannot increase.
(h)
Whether allowed as a matter of right or by special permit,
accessory apartments located on lots subject to the provisions
of the Water Resource Protection or Coastal Pond Overlay
Districts, the total number of bedrooms shall not exceed one
per 10,000 square feet of lot area. Properties that preexist with
a density greater than one bedroom per 10,000 square feet
in a Coastal Pond Overlay District can maintain their existing
bedroom count but cannot increase.
(i)
Owners of properties in a Coastal Pond Overlay District that
want to increase the number of bedrooms beyond the density
outlined in Subsection I(3)(i) can only do so provided that:
Both the principal dwelling and accessory apartment are
connected to the municipal sewer system and only to the
extent allowed within the applicable sewer district bylaw
or regulation; or
[1]
An on-site septic system with enhanced nitrogen removal
approved by the Board of Health is installed on the
property.
[2]
(j)
Design standards. Accessory apartments, whether a part of new
construction, reconstruction, alteration or change to a singlefamily
residence or an attached or detached accessory structure,
shall maintain the following standards:
The architectural effect, as the result of the accessory
apartment being constructed within the principal dwelling or
attached thereto, shall be that of a single-family residence
consistent in its exterior character.
(a)
The architectural effect, as the result of the accessory
apartment being constructed as a detached accessory
structure, shall be that of a structure incidental to a singlefamily
residence and in the same character and period of
architecture as the primary residence.
(b)
(c) Parking for the accessory apartment shall be provided on site.
(4)
Procedures.
An accessory apartment constructed within an existing singlefamily
dwelling or an existing accessory structure attached
(a)
(5)
§ 240-38 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-38
235:383
thereto: Prior to the issuance of a building permit for an
accessory apartment constructed within a single-family
dwelling or accessory structure attached thereto, a Site Plan
Review (Design Review), pursuant to Article XXXIX of the
Zoning Bylaw, shall be conducted by the Planning Board,
taking into account the design standards, requirements and
purposes of this accessory apartment bylaw. The application
for site plan review shall include the information contained in
§ 240-195C, unless waived by the Planning Board.
Accessory apartment constructed within an existing detached
accessory structure or within a new detached accessory
structure (not attached to a single-family dwelling): In addition
to the site plan review requirements above, an accessory
apartment built within or as an accessory structure, not
attached to a single-family dwelling, shall require a special
permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals. In addition to the
design standards, requirements and purposes of this accessory
apartment bylaw, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into
account the standards found in § 240-216A through I of this
bylaw.
(b)
Monitoring.
An affidavit shall be submitted annually to the Building
Commissioner, signed by the property owner, attesting that
the principal dwelling or accessory apartment has been owneroccupied
for a period of seven months and not otherwise
rented as set forth in Subsection I(3)(c) above. The Building
Commissioner may allow a property owner to be absent during
this seven-month period for cause, such as military
assignment, work- or health-related issues, academic
sabbatical or similar circumstance.
(a)
(6)
Enforcement.
Upon a written determination by the Building Commissioner
that the property owner has failed to comply with these
provisions the property owner shall bring the accessory
apartment into compliance within 90 days of such notice.
Failing compliance, the property shall be restored to singlefamily
dwelling status within 90 days of said failure
determination, in a manner that complies with all
requirements of the State Building Code and any other local
regulations or bylaws.

§ 240-65.1. Purpose.
The purpose of this district is to allow for alternative housing for senior
citizens in a setting that provides them with personal and health-related
services and programs and allows for their maximum independence.
§ 240-65.2. Permitted residential uses.
§ 240-65.3. Permitted business uses.
§ 240-65.4. Uses allowed by special permit from the Planning

Senior Care Retirement Community (SCRC), under the following
standards and requirements:
A SCRC contains one or more residential buildings with living units
described below, which provide residences exclusively for persons
62 years of age or older (except their spouses and surviving
spouses, and also except for staff housing and skilled nursing
units), and which includes common areas and community dining
facilities, and which provides personal services such as social,
psychological, educational and health-related programs and
services, designed to allow residents to safely "age in place" with
maximum independence and with skilled caregivers available
continuously on-site.
(1)
A SCRC may include independent living units (ILUs) for persons
who may not require regular assistance with daily living, as well as
assisted living units (ALUs) for persons in need of daily assistance
from skilled caregivers, and may include skilled nursing rooms
(SNRs), as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health. For the purposes of this bylaw, ILUs, ALUs and SNRs shall
be known as “SCRC” units. A SCRC may also include staff housing
units, provided that the number of staff units shall not exceed 10%
of the SCRC units. The total number of units in the development,
(2)
A.
§ 240-65.1 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-65.4
235:407
including both SCRC units and staff housing as determined by the
Planning Board, shall not exceed six units per acre. No unit may
contain more than two bedrooms. Assisted living units shall be no
less than 350 but no greater than 800 square feet in size. Each
skilled nursing room may contain no more than two beds.
A SCRC shall have a minimum total area of 15 acres and lot
frontage of 100 feet. In calculating the minimum total area the
provisions of § 240-124A shall apply. At least 65% of the total
area must be set aside as open space consistent with § 240-130
of the Zoning Bylaw. Up to one-third or five acres of the required
open space, whichever is greater, may be located off-site at the
discretion of the Planning Board. [Amended AFTM 11-9-2009,
Art. 4, approved 2-5-2010]
(3)
Front yard building setbacks shall be a minimum of 50 feet. Side
and rear yard building setbacks shall be a minimum of 25 feet.
The Planning Board may require greater setbacks, up to 100 feet
for front yard and up to 50 feet for rear and side yard setbacks
where needed to provide screening and buffer from the street
or adjacent properties. Redevelopment of existing buildings may
maintain existing setbacks at the discretion of the Planning Board.
Redevelopment does not include the voluntary demolition of an
existing building and subsequent rebuilding.
(4)
The maximum building height of any SCRC building shall be no
more than three stories, not to exceed 35 feet as defined for
community service uses. The Planning Board in its discretion may
increase this height to 45 feet, upon good cause shown by the
applicant, provided that for every one-foot increase in height all
minimum setbacks are increased by two feet.
(5)
The development may incorporate within a residential building
accessory facilities intended solely for the use or benefit of the
residents and staff of the development, such as banking and
recreational facilities, as limited and approved by the Planning
Board.
(6)
The Planning Board, in order to approve the special permit for a
SCRC, must find that the overall impacts of the SCRC in terms
of traffic, wastewater, nutrient loading and fiscal impact to the
Town will be no greater than the impacts associated with other
uses allowed as a matter of right or special permit within Single
Residence or Agricultural Zoning Districts on the lot(s).
Speculative uses, such as applications made under M.G.L. c. 40B,
shall not be considered in making the comparison of cumulative
impacts. The Planning Board may require the applicant to provide
specialized studies or information as necessary in order to make
such a finding.
(7)
§ 240-65.4 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-65.4
235:408
§ 240-65.5. Minimum lot dimensions for uses allowed under
§§ 240-65.2 and 240-65.3.
The Planning Board shall not approve a SCRC unless tertiary
treatment of wastewater is provided. Tertiary treatment shall
include enhanced nitrogen removal consistent with § 240-100A(3)
of the Zoning Bylaw when a SCRC is located in a coastal pond
overlay district.
(8)
The Planning Board may require the applicant to reduce the size
including the height of any residential structure or to adjust its
placement on the lot to reduce impacts on neighborhood visual
character, including views or vistas. The Planning Board, in order
to approve the special permit for a SCRC, must make a positive
finding under § 240-122G, of the Planned Residential Development
Bylaw and four or more of the purposes of § 240-122. The Planning
Board may require or allow that the development be constructed in
phases if necessary to minimize neighborhood impacts or to meet
financing or regulatory requirements.
(9)
Parking shall be located in side or rear yards behind the front
facade line of the building, except that parking may be allowed in
front of the building line at the discretion of the Planning Board
if appropriately screened or landscaped as determined by the
Planning Board. The number of parking spaces shall be determined
according to the following: one space per independent living unit;
one-half space per assisted living unit; one space per employee.
The Planning Board may apply parking reductions to a SCRC as
provided for in § 240-107 as part of this special permit.
(10)
Section 240-65.4A(2) notwithstanding, a density bonus maybe
allowed, at the sole discretion of the Planning Board as part of the
special permit process for a Senior Care Retirement Community, up
to a total of eight units per acre, if the applicant provides at least
15% of the SCRC units (not including staff units) as affordable,
subject to the requirements below, and one or more of the
following: a) tertiary treatment of wastewater that achieves an
annual average nitrogen reduction to a level of nine mg/l or less,
or; b) the application results in no net increase in nitrogen loading
or; c) the SCRC is tied into the municipal sewer system.
As a condition of any density bonus the applicant shall be required
to execute an affordable housing restriction and regulatory
agreement for recordation at the Registry of Deeds, consistent
with the requirements of the Massachusetts Department of
Housing and Community Development, for qualification of the
affordable units towards the Town’s subsidized housing inventory.

Dimensional Regulations
§ 240-66. General regulations.
Applicability. The erection, extension or moving of a structure or the
creation or change in size or shape of a lot (except through a public
taking) must meet the minimum requirements set forth in Article XIV,
unless otherwise expressly provided by this chapter or by MGL c. 40A,
§ 6. The shape of two or more contiguous existing lawful building lots
may be changed provided the area of each lot remains the same or
meets the current minimum requirements in the zoning district and the
total number of buildable lots is the same or less. No lot reconfigured
under this section shall lose its buildable status, and no lot shall be
made nonconforming. [Amended ATM 11-17-2003, Art. 2]
A.
Where a lot is formed from a part of a lot already occupied by a
building, such separation shall be affected in such a manner as not
to impair any of the requirements of this chapter with respect to the
existing building and all yards and other open spaces in connection
therewith, and no permit shall be issued for the erection of a new
building on the new lot thus created unless it complies with all
provisions of this chapter. [Added STM 10-15-1987, Art. 58]
B.
Nonconforming lots. Except as provided in Subsection C(1), any
nonconforming lot having at least 20 feet of frontage on a street shall
be eligible to apply for a building permit if it conforms to the provisions
of any of the following Subsections C(1) through C(7): [Amended ATM
4-7-1982, Art. 56; ATM 4-2-1990, Art. 12]
Any increase in area, or lot width requirements in the Zoning Bylaw
shall not apply to a lot shown on a plan or described in a deed duly
recorded at the Registry of Deeds as of 1 January 1981 for singlefamily
residential use which at the time of the Zoning Bylaw change
was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land, not
otherwise protected by MGL c. 40A, § 6, conformed to then-existing
requirements and had at least 7,500 square feet of area and 50 feet
of frontage.
(1)
Any lot not held in common ownership with any adjoining land as of
1 January 1981, not protected by Subsection C(1), shall be eligible
to apply for a building permit if the lot has at least:
(a) Forty thousand square feet or area in an AGAA/RAA District;
(b) Twenty thousand square feet of area in an AGA/RA/PU District;
(c) Ten thousand square feet of area in an AGB/RB District; or

§ 240-66 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-66
235:411
Any lot not held in common ownership with adjoining land as of 1
January 1981, not protected by Subsection C(1) and (2), may apply
to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a special permit to construct
a single-family residence, if the lot has at least 7,200 square feet
of area. If the petitioner's lot is located within a Water Resource
Protection District, or within 300 feet of an estuary, hereinafter
defined a saltwater passage wherein the tide meets a flow of
freshwater, or within 300 feet of a tidal marsh, tidal pone, tidal
river as defined or within 300 feet of a water body listed in
§ 240-100A, B or C of the Coastal Pond Overlay District, the Board
of Appeals shall require information on the location of public and
private wells within 300 feet of the site; a nutrient analysis of the
receiving waters, taken from the site or from adjacent, undersized
lots; a projection of the cumulative impact on water quality with the
increased density; and a determination that the majority of the lots
within the neighborhood are already developed in addition to the
criteria specified in § 240-216. The Board of Appeals is encouraged
to refer the petition to the Board of Health, the Board of Public
Works and the Planning Board, in accordance with § 240-219.
These additional criteria and the responses of the Boards to which
the petition is referred shall become a part of the decision. The
Board of Appeals may impose certain restrictions designed to
protect or improve the water quality of the area, such as, but not
limited to requirement to keep the lot in its natural vegetation;
maximum floor/area ratio; limitations in other ordinarily permitted
uses which would tend to degrade the water quality; seasonal uses;
or other health and environmental hazards. [Amended AFTM
11-9-2009, Art. 8, approved 2-5-2010]
(3)
Any lot held in common ownership with such adjoining lots, vacant
as of 1 January 1981, may be treated as not held in common
ownership if, as of 1 January 1981, a dwelling was in existence on
all the other commonly held, contiguous lots, or if subsequent to
1 January 1981 the lot was no longer held in common ownership
and a dwelling was permitted by special permit on each of such
adjoining lots. [Amended ATM 4-5-1983, Art. 58; ATM
4-6-2009, Art. 9, approved 5-5-2009]
(4)
Any lot not held in common ownership with any land as of 1 January
1981, not protected by Subsections C(1) or (2), may be eligible
to apply for a building permit, without the benefit of the special
permit required under Subsection C(3), if the petitioner acquires
another undersized vacant lot within the subdivision or immediate
surrounding neighborhood and duly records at the Registry of
Deeds a covenant running in favor of the Town prohibiting the
erecting of any structure thereon; or if the petitioner acquires
the development rights on another undersized vacant lot within
the same subdivision and covenants a permanent development
restriction against these development rights on this lot, such that
the total of the area of the lot to be built upon plus the assignable
(5)
§ 240-66 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-66
235:412
area of the lot to be restricted equal the minimum size
requirements of Subsection C(2). More than one petitioner may
participate in the acquisition of the undersized vacant lot or the
entire lot, and as long as the sum of the restricted development
area assignable to each petitioner does not exceed the sum of the
area of the restricted lot. [Amended ATM 4-7-1986, Art. 75]
Any lot held in common ownership with any adjoining land as of
1 January 1981, not protected by Subsection C(4), may apply to
the Planning Board for a special permit to construct a single-family
residence if the lots are on roads which have been constructed as
of April 1, 1982, in accordance with Chapter 305, the Subdivision
Rules and Regulations of the Town of Falmouth, and if the lots
are resubdivided so that the total area of the commonly held lots,
when divided by the number of building permits to be requested,
results in an area of land per single-family residence that equals
at least 75% of the existing requirements for that zoning district.
The additional criteria specified in Subsection C(3) shall also be
considered. In addition, the Planning Board may set aside one of
the created lots as an open space lot as allowed under MGL C. 41,
§ 81U. [Amended ATM 4-7-1986, Art. 75]
(6)
Any lot in an RB or AGB Zoning District, shown on a plan or
described in a deed duly recorded at the Registry of Deeds before
January 1, 1975, with an area of at least 20,000 square feet, shall
be eligible for a building permit by right, as long as the lot width
is 100 feet or greater, provided that the lot conforms to all other
requirements of the Zoning Bylaws. [Added ATM 4-6-1983, Art.
63]
(7)
Any lot in a GR, RC, RB, RA, AGB or AGA Zoning District not held
in common ownership with adjoining land as of 1 January 1994,
shown on a plan filed at the Registry of Deeds before April 4, 1988,
with an area of at least 45,000 square feet, lot width of at least 150
feet and frontage of at least 100 feet, shall be eligible for a building
permit by right, provided that on any such lot otherwise ineligible
for a building permit the number of bedrooms shall not exceed
one bedroom per 13,500 square feet of lot area, unless additional
bedroom unless additional bedrooms are allowed by special permit,
in which case the Board of Appeals shall impose conditions to
preserve and protect existing and potential sources of drinking
water, including required use of a sewage disposal system with
enhanced nitrogen removal. [Added ASTM 4-3-1995, Art. 17]
(8)
One dwelling per lot. Not more than one dwelling shall be erected on
a single lot except for multifamily use as allowed for within designated
zoning districts. An existing, nonconforming use of two or more
structures on a single lot, as of 1 January 1981, not previously used for
year-round habitation, may not be altered, reconstructed, extended or
changed structurally, except by special permit from the Zoning Board
of Appeals. Year-round habitation is deemed to be an extension of

Coastal Pond Overlay District
[Added ATM 4-4-1988, Art. 46]
§ 240-97. Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to preserve the water quality in Falmouth's
coastal ponds and harbors in accordance with adopted plans for both
development and preservation, while recognizing that the public sector has
an equal role with private sectors in meeting the established goals for
swimmable, fishable and usable water of the highest possible esthetic and
natural quality.
§ 240-98. Establishment and delineation of Coastal Pond Overlay
District.48
This article shall apply to all developments listed here:

§ 240-100. Restrictions. [Amended AFTM 11-6-1995, Art. 14,
approved 12-26-1995]
Development subject to this Article shall be restricted in accordance with
the following goals and standards:
The reviewing board shall make all findings regarding the analysis
and may withhold approval if the proposal does not comply with the
standards of this Article. However, the reviewing board shall not
withhold approval of an application if the applicant provides measures
for the reduction of the nutrient loading rate, on a pounds-per-acre
basis, to a rate below that which would produce critical eutrophic
levels in the receiving water body. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to demonstrate that the proposed mitigating measures will
work as designed, and the reviewing board may require the applicant
to demonstrate on an annual basis that said mitigating measures are
operating satisfactorily. [Amended AFTM 11-6-1995, Art. 14,
approved 12-26-1995]
B.
High quality areas: Areas designated as high quality areas shall be
provided the highest level of protection. These estuarine areas support
high-quality shellfish and areas of high scenic and esthetic quality.
Those development proposals not meeting the standards for these areas
must be permanently restricted as necessary to reduce nutrient loading
including such actions as:
Reductions in number of units, bedrooms, rooms or leasable square
footage of a building; reduction of the number of lots in a
subdivision. [Amended AFTM 11-6-1995, Art. 14, approved
12-26-1995]
(1)
Improvements to area road drainage, pond circulation and other
physical conditions within and around the affected water body.
(2)
The applicant may be required to install a septic system that has
certification from Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (Mass. DEP) for general, provisional or, if approved by
the Board of Health, pilot use for nitrogen reduction. To reduce
the overall need for management oversight and to achieve higher
nitrogen removal performance, the Reviewing Board shall require
the collection of wastewater flows and the use of shared treatment
facilities (also known as "cluster" systems). If the applicant
demonstrates to the Reviewing Board that a cluster system is not
technically feasible, individual nitrogen-removing on-site systems
shall be required instead. In reviewing the range of technologies
available and permitted in the commonwealth, the Reviewing
Board may limit any project proposed in the Coastal Pond Overlay
District to wastewater discharge total nitrogen concentrations of
twelve (12) mg/l or less and require that the treatment systems
are properly operated and maintained by a licensed wastewater
treatment plant operator. The twelve-mg/l or less standard assumes

§ 240-103. Applicability. [Amended ATM 4-4-1985, Art. 70; ATM
4-7-1986, Art. 93]
The following shall apply to all premises in all districts, except as provided
in § 240-104.
§ 240-104. Waiver of parking requirements. [Amended ATM
4-7-1986, Art. 93]
§ 240-105. Performance requirement.
Off-street parking must be provided to service the net increase in parking
demand created by new construction, additions or change of use. Buildings,
structures and land uses in existence April 2, 1979, are not subject to these
requirements so long as they are not enlarged or changed to increase their
parking needs.
§ 240-106. Number of spaces.
The standards below must be met without counting any existing parking
necessary for existing activities to meet these requirements. The additional
Finding that Business 1 districts on Main Street are unique, having a
large amount of public parking spaces available, and further finding
that in order to enhance the economic vitality of downtown Main Street,
some expansion of retail activity balanced with residential development
is desired and possible, parking requirements shall be waived for the
following:
All lots in which the ground floor of existing or proposed structures
are devoted solely to the uses specified in § 240-48A, C and D, and
in which the existing or proposed structure does not exceed 60%
coverage of the lot, and does not exceed a floor-space to lot-area
ratio (FAR) of more than six-tenths (0.6), whichever is less.
(1)
Residential dwellings as permitted under § 240-51A(2) and (5), may
be added over and above the FAR restriction of Subsection A(1)(a)
above only when said dwellings are located above the ground floor,
the total FAR of the building does not exceed 1.0; i.e., total floor
space equal to total lot area; the lot coverage by buildings does
not exceed 60%, and the building conforms to required height
limitations. [Amended STM 10-24-1989, Art. 71]
(2)
A.
Any expansion, new construction or reconstruction using the above
waivers shall require a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals
under Article XXXIX, regardless of the number of parking spaces which
may otherwise be required. [Amended STM 10-24-1989, Art. 71]
B.
§ 240-103 WETLANDS PROTECTION § 240-106
235:453
parking required for a change of use or addition equals the parking
requirements under § 240-108 for the premises as existing, or the actual
amount of existing parking retained, if greater. Requirements are added for
mixed uses (e.g., both motel room and restaurant requirements would apply
to a motel with restaurant).

The area preserved by the above reduction shall be planted and
shall not be applied to the minimum area required to be left without
cover under § 240-68A.
(2)
A.
Reduction by special permit. The required number of spaces may be
further reduced below that indicated below on special permit from
the Board of Appeals upon the Board's determination that special
circumstances, such as shared use of a parking lot by activities having
different peak demand times, render a lesser provision adequate for all
parking needs. For uses allowed only on a special permit, the special
permit granting authority may similarly require a larger number of
parking spaces to be provided than indicated if necessary to service
anticipated demand.

15]
§ 240-113. Special permit requirements in recharge zones for
transient residential facilities. [Added ATM 4-4-1984, Art. 51]
Intent. The intent of this section is to alleviate pollution problems
caused by existing or proposed storm drain systems which discharge
directly into the Town's streams, ponds, lakes, coastal waters or other
sensitive areas through the prohibition of direct discharge from
roadways, parking lots, driveways or similar uses.
A.
Design requirements:
Installation and materials unless otherwise specified shall conform
to the standards of the Massachusetts D.P.W. Standard
Specifications, 1985, as amended.
(1)
No road or other surface shall be regraded, constructed or
maintained in such a manner as to divert or direct the flow of runoff
into any wetland as defined in MGL C. 131, § 40, and any other area
protected by this Act.
(2)
Uncontaminated runoff should be directed in such a way as to
recharge the groundwater within the lot where it originates, unless
an alternative location is approved.
(3)
Open detention and retention basins may not be located within
velocity zones as depicted on FEMA FIRM maps of the Town.
(4)
Design calculations based on a twenty-five-year storm are required.
Percolation tests may be required.
(5)
Cellar/basement drains and sump pumps may not directly
discharge into wetlands or waterways.
(6)
(7) Oil capture separation and sedimentation devices may be required.
B.
The special permit granting authority may withhold approval of a
special permit for the construction of any new structure or structures
or portion thereof intended for transient residential use, requiring a
special permit as defined by this chapter, which are located on a lot or
lots that lie within a zoned water recharge area (see Subsection B), if,
after weighing all the pertinent facts and evidence the special permit
granting authority finds that:
The existing condition of the receiving waters is at or above critical
eutrophic levels [see definition Subsection C(4)(d)], or in the case
of well recharge areas, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the
groundwater exceed five parts per million; and
(1)
The nutrient contribution from the proposed development, when
added to the existing and potential nutrient level of developments
(2)
A.
§ 240-112 FALMOUTH CODE § 240-113
235:462
within the specific recharge area, will generate on a pounds-peracre
basis, nutrient levels that exceed the receiving waters' critical
eutrophic level or, in the case of well recharge areas, nitratenitrogen
concentrations in the groundwater in excess of five parts
per million. However, the special permit granting authority shall
not withhold approval of an application for a special permit if
the applicant provides measures for the reduction of the nutrient
loading rate, on a pounds-per-acre basis, to a rate below that
which would produce critical eutrophic levels in the water body
or, if in a well recharge area, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations less
than five parts per million. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to demonstrate to the special permit granting authority
that the proposed mitigating measures will work as designed, and
the special permit granting authority may require the applicant to
demonstrate on an annual basis that said mitigating measures are
operating satisfactorily.
Recharge areas. Recharge areas for freshwater ponds, coastal ponds
and existing or proposed public (municipal) water supply wells, as
shown on the Zoning Map, shall be considered superimposed over any
other districts established in this chapter.
B.
Analysis of development impact. The applicant, under this section,
shall provide an analysis of development impact which at a minimum
includes the following:
The existing condition of the water body or water supply, including
physical characteristics and water chemistry;
(1)
The expected change in the condition of the water body or water
supply as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
The comparison, on a per-acre basis, of the total nutrient loading
from the proposed development with:
The existing and potential loading from all other developments
and acreage within the recharge area of the water supply or
water body; and
(a)
The loading rate which would be expected to produce critical
eutrophic levels in a water body or in the case of water supply,
the loading rate which would produce nitrate-nitrogen levels in
excess of five parts per million in the groundwater.
(b)
(3)
In determining the impact of nutrient loading from a development,
the following standards and definitions shall be used:*
Loading per person: five pounds nitrogen per person per year;
twenty-five hundredths (.25) pounds phosphorous per person
per year for sewage disposal systems within 300 feet of the
shoreline;
(a)
(4)
C.

235:463
§ 240-113.1. Transportation and traffic management. [Added ASTM
4-5-1999, Art. 12, approved 7-23-1999]
Loading from lawn fertilizers: three pounds nitrogen per 1,000
square feet per year;
(b)
Loading from road runoff: nineteen hundredths (.19) pounds
nitrogen per curb mile per day; fifteen hundredths (.15)
pounds phosphorous per curb mile per day;
(c)
Critical eutrophic levels: freshwater concentration, total
phosphorous = two hundredths (.02) mg./litre; saltwater
concentration, total nitrogen = see Article XXI. (Coastal Pond
Overlay District).
*Unless the applicant demonstrates to the special permit
granting authority that given the nature of the proposed
project and/or receiving waters other standards are
appropriate.
(d)
Exemptions. The special permit granting authority may exempt an
application from the requirements of Subsection A provided that the
applicant can demonstrate that:
Nutrients from the development will not in fact be recharged to the
designated water body or public water supply well; or
(1)
That the development will not result in any increase in loading of
the relevant nutrient.
(2)
D.
Relation to other requirements of the Zoning Bylaw. Approval of a
special permit as noted in Subsection A shall not substitute for
compliance with any other requirements of the Zoning Act or Falmouth
Zoning Bylaw.
E.
Development and redevelopment subject to site plan review shall not
degrade existing levels of service (LOS) of surrounding roads and
intersections based on summer peak hour traffic volumes. Levels of
service shall be measured using performance indicators such as reserve
capacity, delay at intersections and volume-to-capacity ratio as defined
in the Highway Capacity Manual, latest edition. (NOTE: Highway
Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board, Washington, D.C.)
A.
Developments and redevelopment subject to site plan review shall
mitigate any traffic impacts that would be created by such
developments. The mitigation strategies shall include both structural
and non-structural improvements with special emphasis on alternatives
to automobile transportation. Necessary improvements shall occur
concurrently with any development or a contribution of funds towards
the necessary improvement shall be provided.

ARTICLE XXIV
Landscape Requirements
[Amended ATM 4-4-1979, Art. 102; ASTM 4-6-1992, Art. 22]
§ 240-114. Purpose and intent.
§ 240-115. Landscape plan required.
All development projects other than single- or two-family dwellings that
require a special permit or review under Articles XXXVIII and XXXIX shall
submit a landscape plan as part of the required application.
§ 240-116. Procedure.
The landscape plan shall be part of the application for which it is required
in § 240-115. It shall be drawn at a scale of no greater than one inch =
20 feet. When required by the permitting board the plan shall be prepared
by a landscape architect, arborist or horticulturalist, registered with the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Each sheet shall be signed and sealed
and numbered as a part of the total.
§ 240-117. Plan contents.
The landscape plan shall show the location of existing trees of greater than
four inches in trunk diameter at a height of four feet six inches, vegetation
to remain undisturbed after development, vegetation to be planted,
landscape objects and structures, vehicle and pedestrian ways and finished
topography. Individual specimens of trees and shrubs shall be represented
on the plan. Herbaceous perennials, annuals, bulbs and ground covers may
be represented as planting areas. A list shall be on the plan containing
plant names (genus, species, variety and/or cultivar), quantities, size when
planted and height at maturity. A list of approved street trees and buffer
species is available in the Planning office.
The purpose of landscape regulation is to protect the general health,
safety and welfare of the residents of Falmouth; to assist in reducing
incompatibility between abutting uses; to provide barriers and relief
from traffic, noise, heat, glare, fumes, dust and debris; to preserve
and enhance the character of the community; to prevent soil erosion
and silting of drainage structures and water bodies; to retain existing
significant trees, and protect rare and endangered plant species and
wildlife; and to provide shade and windbreaks.
A.
To this purpose, it is the intent of the Town that streets, sidewalks and
parking spaces be shaded by trees; that parking, service and outdoor
storage areas be screened from view of the street and neighboring
properties; that residences be buffered from commercial activities;
and that impervious surfaces and ground without vegetative cover be
minimized.

The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within the perimeter
(total area) of a planned residential development shall be determined
by the standard density allowed in the district in which the planned
residential development is located, as set forth in Article XIV but after
subtracting that land area excluded under § 140-124. To demonstrate
the maximum number of dwelling units, an applicant shall submit a
conventional preliminary subdivision plan of land showing a lot layout
complying with the minimum lot area, lot frontage and lot width
requirements of the Zoning Bylaw with a street layout which complies
with the Planning Board's Rules and Regulations Governing the
Subdivision of Land. Density may be less where a determination is
made by the Planning Board that physical and topographic features
of the land would preclude attainment of such density under existing
zoning. [Amended AFTM 11-17-1997, Art. 4, approved 2-27-1998]

To qualify for the density bonus, the Planning Board must find
that the open space set aside meets criteria B(1)(a) in addition to
at least one of the three criteria listed under B(1)(b), B(1)(c) and
B(1)(d) below:
The proposed open space parcel abuts existing public open
space or protected open space owned by a nonprofit land trust.
(a)
There are rare, threatened or endangered species in the open
space parcel to be provided in the planned residential
development or the addition of the proposed open space parcel
further protects rare, threatened or endangered species on any
adjoining open space parcel, whether public or private.
(b)
The proposed open space parcel links, via a public access
easement or similar instrument, existing or proposed public
hiking or walking trails, bikeways, access points to the
shoreline, etc.
(c)
The applicant proposes to donate the open space to a land trust
or public entity to allow for public access.

Affordable Housing Development
[Added STM 10-8-1986, Art. 68]
§ 240-135. Purpose and authority.
In furtherance of the purpose stated in § 240-1 of this chapter, .".. to
encourage housing for persons of all income levels," and in accordance
with MGL C. 40A, § 9, which allows local municipalities to adopt "incentive"
ordinances for the creation of affordable housing, and for the purpose of
helping people who have lived and worked in Falmouth and who, because
of rising land prices have been unable to obtain suitable housing at a
reasonable price and maintaining a stable economy by preventing the
outmigration of lower-income groups who provide essential services, the
Planning Board, upon issuance of a special permit which allows an increase
in density through a partial waiver of Article XIV dimensional requirements,
and which otherwise conforms to the requirements of Article XXV, Planned
Residential Development, shall require that all units constructed above
"as-of-right" density limitations be sold at prices significantly lower than
their market value. As a further incentive for the construction of affordable
housing, the Board may, at its discretion, waive certain design standards
of improvement requirements provided in Chapter 305, the Falmouth
Subdivision Regulations, or permit a transfer of development rights as per
Article XXXVI.
§ 240-136. Standards.
Sale price: shall be consistent with § 240-216J. [Amended AFTM
11-9-2009, Art. 11, approved 2-5-2010]
A.
Number of affordable units: The number of units allowed above "as-ofright"
density will be subject to negotiation and will be determined with
due regard to the project approval requirements of this Article. The
maximum density increase shall be no more than 25% than that allowed
by a standard grid-type subdivision.
B.
Design standards: Specific design standards for construction within
the plan shall be made part of the special permit and will be used to
ensure conformity and compatibility between units. Other requirements
for design shall be as required under Article XXV of this chapter, and
applicable sections of Chapter 305, the Falmouth Subdivision Rules and
Regulations.
C.
Modification at standards: The standards of Article XXV may be
modified upon a finding by the Board that such modification creates no
adverse impacts on health, safety and welfare, and is found to be in the
public interest because of the high quality of design that would result
from said modification.
D.
Phasing: A schedule of construction must be submitted providing the
timely delivery of the affordable units.

These increases in density shall be prohibited within the Water
Resource Protection Districts as shown on the Official Zoning Maps.
F.
The Board is satisfied that the applicant has conformed to the design
standards of this Article, and will deliver the needed affordable units.
A.
The proposed development site plan is designed in its site allocation
proportions, orientation, materials, landscaping and other features as
to provide a stable and desirable character complementary and integral
with the site's natural features.
B.
The Board makes a finding that such development, density increase,
relaxation of zoning standards or transfer of development rights does
not have a material, detrimental effect on the character of the
neighborhood or the Town and is consistent with the performance
standards of Article XXIII and sequence.
C.
The Board makes a positive finding as to the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement as required by § 305-14 of Chapter
305, the Falmouth Subdivision Regulations.

Example: Ten lots within an RC donor district are transferred under
this chapter to an RB parcel within a receiving district. The RB parcel
has suitable acreage under the provisions of Article XXV of this chapter
for 20 lots. However, the transfer of 10 lots in the RC District to the
RB District entitles the RB landowner to a four-lot bonus [10 (RC) x
1.4 (assignable credit, § 240-177) = 14]. Thus, the total number of lots
possible in the RB receiving district under this section is 34:

Adult Uses59
[Added ASTM 4-7-1997, Art. 11, approved 7-1-1997]
§ 240-229. Intent and purpose.
The intent of the bylaw is to regulate the locations of adult uses in order
to lessen the harmful secondary effects on adjacent areas. These secondary
effects, which are documented in various studies of towns comparable in
size and composition to Falmouth, include an increase in crime, a decline
in property values, a flight of existing businesses and gradual blight of
residential neighborhoods. The purpose of the Adult Use Bylaw is to prevent
crime, maintain property values, protect the Town's retail trade and protect
and preserve the quality of residential neighborhoods. The bylaw does not
prohibit adult uses, but rather provides reasonable alternative avenues of
expression throughout the Town.
§ 240-230. Special permit requirements.
Adult uses as defined in Article III, Definitions, of the Zoning Bylaw are
allowed by special permit through the Board of Appeals in Light Industrial A
and Business 2 Zoning Districts. Adult uses must comply with the following
requirements in addition to the requirements in Article XLII, Special
Permits:
Dimensional requirements. The proposed adult use must comply with
the following minimum distance separations:
A minimum 4,000 foot separation is required from any other adult
use.
(1)
A minimum 600 foot separation is required from the adult use
structure to existing residential uses and districts; educational
uses; religious uses; public beaches; and public active recreation
facilities, including school athletic fields and facilities, Town parks,
and the Gus Canty Recreation Center/Fuller Field complex, as
documented in Table 4 of the Town's Open Space Element.
(2)
A minimum 500 foot separation is required from any establishment
licensed under the provisions of MGL c. 138, § 12.
(3)
A 20 foot vegetative buffer containing adequate screening given
the character of the neighborhood and the intensity of the use shall
be provided between adult uses and abutting commercial uses.
(4)
A.
Other requirements.
Adequate provisions for security provided by public safety officers
must be documented.

The applicant or owner must disclose if they have been convicted
of violating the provisions of MGL c. 119, § 63, or MGL c. 272,
§ 28. A special permit shall not be issued to any person convicted
of violating the provisions of MGL c. 119, § 63 or MGL c. 272, § 28.
The applicant is to disclose any and all involvement with other adult
uses in the Town.

advertising that fall within the definition of adult use or are erotic,
prurient or related to violence, sadism or sexual exploitation shall
be displayed in the windows of, or on the building of any adult
use, or be visible to the public from the pedestrian sidewalks or
walkways or from other public or semipublic areas outside such
establishments.
(3)
Any commercial establishment or activity that promotes or
portrays, under the guise of entertainment or education, sexual
abuse of or by or among men, women and children, and any such
abuse that threatens their health and the health of a community
shall not be granted a permit in the Town of Falmouth.
Furthermore, any such commercial establishment or activity that
violates the community standards of said Town shall not be granted
a permit in the Town of Falmouth.
(4)
Procedures. Adult use special permits shall only be issued following
public hearings held within 65 days after filing of an application with
the special permit granting authority, a copy of which shall forthwith be
given to the Town Clerk by the applicant. The special permit granting
authority shall act within 90 days following the close of a public hearing
for which notice has been given by publication or posting as provided
in MGL c. 40A, § 11, and by mailing to all parties in interest. Failure
by a special permit granting authority to take final action upon an
application for a special permit within said 90 days following the date
of public hearing shall be deemed to be a grant of the permit applied
for. Special permits issued by a special permit granting authority shall
require a concurring vote of four members of a five-member board.

Lapse.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 240-221, a special permit
granted under this article shall lapse after one year, and including

if a substantial use thereof has not sooner commenced except for
good cause, or in the case of a permit for construction, if the
construction has not begun by such date, except for good cause.
The determination of good cause shall be made by the special
permit granting authority.

Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote the revitalization of
commercial centers using mixed-use redevelopment integrating retail,
office, restaurant and community service uses with housing, such as
second floor apartments, condominiums and townhomes. This
redevelopment fosters pedestrian-friendly streetscapes by requiring
rear and side yard parking, allowing shared parking between
businesses and uses, reducing and consolidating curb cuts, and
allowing parking reductions in exchange for on-site green space. The
district also relaxes front, side and rear yard setbacks to encourage
sidewalk development and pedestrian-friendly storefronts to offer
streetside gathering places in front of redeveloped properties, rather
than front yard parking fields.
A.

Authority; History
§ 305-1. Statutory authority.
These rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town
of Falmouth have been adopted pursuant to MGL C. 41, § 81Q, and are
published to assist landowners, developers and landscape architects in
complying with the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law (MGL C. 41,
§§ 81K-81GG). Reference should be made to that statute, to the Zoning
Act (MGL C. 40A) and to the Zoning Bylaw (Chapter 240) of the Town of
Falmouth for applicable provisions not set out in these regulations. For the
purpose of these regulations, a "subdivision" is the division of a tract of land
into two or more lots, as defined in MGL C. 41, § 81L, of the Subdivision
Control Law.
§ 305-2. Historical information.
Regulation of subdivisions was started in Falmouth when the Town voted
to adopt MGL C. 41, § 73, providing for a Board of Survey (1924 May Sp.
19). A Planning Board had been established a year earlier, but the Board
of Survey continued to function until 1947 when the Town adopted MGL
C. 41, §§ 81A-81J (1947 AN 97) which transferred subdivision control to
the Planning Board. The first subdivision regulations were adopted in 1950;
revisions were made in 1953, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1962, 1964, 1971, 1977,
1979, 1982 and 1988. The present text reproduced herein was adopted on
October 22, 1991.

(b)
Determination of nutrient loading shall be done using available
loading estimates from County, state or federal performance
standards and shall include, at a minimum:
The existing condition of the water body or water supply,
including physical characteristics and water chemistry.
[1]
The expected change in the condition of the water body or
water supply as a result of the proposed development.

The comparison, on a per-acre basis, of the total nutrient
loading from the proposed development with:
The existing and potential loading from all other
developments and acreage within the recharge area of
the water supply or water body.
[a]
The loading rate which would be expected to produce
critical eutrophic levels in a water body or in the
case of water supply, the loading rate which would
produced nitrate-nitrogen levels in excess of five parts
per million in the groundwater.
[b]
[3]
The proposal of measures to reduce nutrient loading if
Subsection C(1)(c)[3] above indicates that the per-acre
loading rate from the proposed development will equal
or exceed the critical loading rate when combined with

dwellings in the future lower the water table significantly in the
area as a result of increased use, at the expense of or detriment to
existing homes?
(3)
Environmental effects of on-site sewage disposal. What is the
permeability of the underlying soil? Will individual or collective
sewage disposal systems endanger in the foreseeable future, wells
for potable water of dwellings either within or without the
proposed subdivision, or will any such disposal systems thus
endanger any public water supply source or any marsh, swamp,
bog, pond, stream or other body of water by introducing therein
excessive nutrients, dangerous chemical substances or
pathological organisms?
(4)
If the subdivision has access to a public sewerage system, is the

How many persons may be expected to inhabit the proposed
subdivision? Of these, how many may be expected to be of school
age (five to 16 years of age)? What requirements for additional
transportation, classroom space, etc., is this likely to put upon the
school system, how soon and at what projected cost to the Town?
(7)
Will the drainage runoff from the systems of roads within the
proposed subdivision be likely to damage adjoining property,
overload or silt up or contaminate in any way any marsh, swamp,
bog, pond, stream or other body of water or endanger any public or
private potable water supply? Will any proposed filling, cutting or
other alteration of the topography or any devegetating operations
within the subdivision tend to alter existing natural drainage
patterns so as to create problems within or outside of the
subdivision?
(8)
Are the access roads, public or private, by which the proposed
subdivision may be reached adequate in width, grades and type
of construction to carry, without danger, congestion or confusion,
the additional traffic that may be generated by the proposed
subdivision?
(9)
What are the estimated additional new service requirements, in
time and/or cost, that the proposed subdivision may place upon the
Town for solid waste disposal and snow removal?
(10)
What additional burden will the proposed subdivision place upon
the public safety services (fire and police) and at what probable
cost to the Town in terms of additional hours (manpower) or
additional facilities (vehicles or buildings)?
(11)
Will the proposed subdivision have any probable detrimental effect
on the ecology of the local area, such as:
Increased runoff of rainfall and/or melting snow resulting in
lessened recharge of the groundwater table.

A.
Width, alignment and grades.
Minor streets shall be designed using the following minimum
criteria:
(a) Width of layout: 44 feet.
(b) Width of pavement, including twelve-inch berms: 22 feet.
(c) Minimum center-line radii of 150 feet.
(d) Reverse curve tangent: 100 feet.
Grades not less than zero and eight-tenths percent (0.8%) and
not more than 10%.
(e)
(f) Vertical curve sight distance of at least 150 feet.
(1)
Curvilinear alignments shall be used to discourage traffic speeds of
more than 25 miles per hour on minor streets, but bumps shall not
be used for that purpose.
(2)
Vertical curves are required whenever the algebraic difference in
grade between center-line tangents is 2% or more. The minimum
vertical curve length for minor streets shall be 100 feet but also
(3)
B.
§ 305-24 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 305-24
280:665
no less than the length obtained by multiplying the algebraic
difference in grade by the factor 20 for crest and by factor 25
for sag curve. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be
avoided.
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles or radial to curves. No street shall intersect any other
street at less than 60°.
(4)
Street lines at intersections shall be rounded with a radius of not
less than 25 feet in residential subdivisions and not less than 35
feet in industrial and commercial subdivisions.
(5)
Grades at intersections of more than 2% for the first 100 feet,
measured from the exterior line of the intersected street, will not
be approved.
(6)
The grading at the intersection of streets shall be so designed as to
be safe and convenient for travel and to direct the flow of surface
water in a suitable manner.
(7)
If a street layout at the entrance to a subdivision abuts property not
owned by the subdivider, the width of the layout shall be 60 feet
for the first 200 feet from the intersecting road. The entrance road
shall be located within the layout so that the extra 16 feet of width
will be used to provide additional buffering from the road for the
abutting property owner.
(8)
Street cross section. The grading of the shoulders and slopes and
the location of the pavement, utilities and drainage structures shall
conform to the typical sections shown on the drawings filed as part of
the definitive plan.
C.
Dead-end streets.
For the purposes of these subdivision rules and regulations, a
"dead-end street" is defined as any street or system of streets
which has only a single access to an existing street system with two
or more points of access. Any such street or system of streets shall
be considered a dead end regardless of size or internal circulation
patterns.
(1)
Dead-end streets shall not be longer than 500 feet unless, in the
opinion of the Board, a greater length is desirable due to
topography or other local conditions. Fire hydrants shall not be
more than 500 feet apart.
(2)
Dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having an outside street line radius of at least 60 feet.
The width of the paved loop shall not be diminished and the grade
shall not exceed 3%. T-turnarounds shall consist of an eighteen-foot
minimum width of pavement approximately at right angles to the
(3)
D.
§ 305-24 FALMOUTH CODE § 305-24
280:666
street, at least 80 feet in length, with maximum grade of 4% and
minimum curb radii of 25 feet.
Adequate access from a public way. When the physical condition or
width of a public way from which a subdivision has its access is
considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected
to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the
applicant to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the
abutting public way to a width at least as great as that required within
the subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within
such public way to the same standards required within the subdivision.
Any such dedication of land for purpose of way and any such work
performed within such public way shall be made only with permission
of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way, and
all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne by the
applicant.
E.
Drainage.
The Falmouth Department of Public Works considers road drainage
designs which rely entirely on standard-type leaching basins to be
inadequate.
(1)
Adequate areas of land must be set aside at all significant low
points to receive the stormwater. These street drainage catchment
areas, along with any drainage easements required, shall be shown
on the definitive plan so as to become part of the permanent
record.
(2)
Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to accommodate the
runoff from the entire watershed area, whether inside or outside
the subdivision, under conditions of total potential development
permitted under Chapter 240, Zoning.
(3)
When the subdivision creates a need for drainage improvements
outside the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to secure
the necessary easement and provide such improvements.
(4)
Storm drainage installations, including catch basins, pipelines,
leaching basins, culverts, manholes, outlet head walls with riprap
aprons and paved waterways, shall be required to permit
unimpeded flow of all natural watercourses, to ensure adequate
drainage of all low points along streets, to control erosion of slopes
and shoulders and to intercept stormwater runoff along streets
at intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the
area drained. To the maximum extent feasible, stormwater shall be
recharged rather than piped to surface waters, and no drainage
structure should be installed within 100 feet of any natural water
body or wetland.
(5)
Natural drainage courses, swales properly stabilized with plant
materials and drainage catchment areas shall be utilized to dispose
(6)
F.
§ 305-24 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 305-24
280:667
§ 305-25. Easements.
of water on the site through natural percolation. To obtain
maximum percolation of runoff, it is necessary in all drainage areas
to retain and leave undisturbed as much existing vegetation as
possible, particularly large trees and shrubs. Use of natural areas
for drainage is preferred. However, if such natural drainage areas
are insufficient or nonexistent, drainage areas shall be constructed
only under the supervision of the Falmouth Department of Public
Works. Newly constructed drainage areas shall be planted with
shrubs and trees suitable for moist soils. All drainage areas shall be
tested for the rate of percolation.
The surface water may be directed to the catchment areas by pipes
of not less than 10 inches diameter from catch basins or by the use
of paved Type I asphalt waterways. Storm drains shall be designed
to ensure a rate of flow of not less than three nor more than eight
cubic feet per second under design conditions.
(7)
A design analysis by a registered professional engineer shall be
submitted with each definitive plan and shall include consideration
of the entire watershed and the calculations used in designing the
drainage system, including area calculations, intensity of rainfall,
coefficient of runoff, time of concentration, discharge, coefficients
of roughness and quantity and velocity of flow under design
conditions.
(8)
The following standards shall be used in designing drainage
facilities for new subdivision roads: storm intensity, 2.5 inches
rainfall per hour (twenty-five-year storm); storm duration, one
hour; road areas to be considered 100% impervious, with all other
land area within the watershed considered to be 40% impervious.
(9)
When the land is in a watershed protection area, hydrographic
tests may be required to determine the direction of underground
water flow.
(10)
When land is in a floodplain district, see Article VIII of these
regulations.
(11)
Easements for municipal services, utilities and drainage facilities,
within or outside of the street layout, shall be provided where
necessary. Easements shall be at least 20 feet wide and centered on lot
lines where practical.
A.
Slope easements shall be provided where cut or fill slopes cannot be
contained within the street layout.
B.
Sight easements shall be provided where clearing and grading at street
intersections is necessary to prevent blind corners and to permit
permanent maintenance of visibility.
C.
§ 305-24 FALMOUTH CODE § 305-25
280:668
§ 305-26. Open spaces.
The Board may require in proper cases that the plan show a park or parks
suitably located for playground or recreation purposes. The park or parks
shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being subdivided
and to the prospective uses of such land. Deeding of open spaces to lot
owners is preferred. The applicant shall furnish the Board with a certified
copy of any easement or restrictions of record relating to or affecting such
parks, playgrounds and recreation areas and the continued maintenance
thereof.
§ 305-27. Protection of natural features.
§ 305-28. Fire alarm system.
One fire alarm box shall be provided in all subdivisions with 12 or more lots.
§ 305-29. Fire hydrants.
Hydrants shall be provided every 500 linear feet of street. They shall be of
a style approved both by the Fire Chief and Department of Public Works.
§ 305-30. Sidewalks, grass plots and street trees.
Sidewalks, grass plots and street trees shall be required in every
subdivision. (See Standard Cross Sections, Schedules A and B.)72
Easements may be required for the continuation of pedestrian traffic,
underground utilities and bikeways.
D.
Easements for all municipal utility services shall be granted to the
Town when the performance bond or covenant is executed for the
maintenance, repair and extension of municipal utility services within
all the private ways shown on the approved definitive plan.
E.
Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees,
watercourses, scenic points, historic or archaeological sites and similar
community assets, which if preserved, will add attractiveness and value
to the property.
A.
Existing contours shall be preserved insofar as it is practical to do so.
No change shall be made in the contour of the land that adversely
affects the land abutting the proposed subdivision.
B.
To be more attractive and economical, subdivisions should closely
adhere to the topography of the land, with the streets designed so as to
minimize the necessity for excessive cut or fill.

280:685
The Clerk shall read the application into the record and then read any
referrals from Town Departments or correspondences from interested
parties. The applicant or her/his authorized agent will then briefly
summarize the application and why relief/approval should be granted
in accordance with specific sections of the Zoning Bylaw. [Note:
information provided less than one (1) week prior to a public hearing
by any party may result in a continuance.] It is generally expected
that the applicant's presentation will not exceed fifteen (15) minutes
in length. Some applications are sufficiently complex that more time
is required, particularly when there are multiple presenters. To ensure
the opportunity for all applicants to have the full opportunity to be
heard on a given evening, should the presentation exceed fifteen (15)
minutes in length, the Board shall take one (1) or more of the following
actions by majority vote of the voting members: [Amended 3-5-2016]
Inquire as to how much additional time the applicant requires to
complete the presentation and proceed if a limited amount of time
is needed;
(1)
Continue the hearing to the end of the meeting, depending on
available time; or
(2)
(3) Continue the hearing to another date and time.74
E.
The Zoning Administrator will provide any updates and alert the Board
to any issues to be considered.
F.
G. Members will ask questions of the applicant.
The public will be asked for comment if applicable. It is generally
expected that comments from the public in total will not exceed 15
minutes in length. Collective public testimony exceeding this period
may result in the termination of public comment in order to
accommodate the Board's hearing schedule. Individuals recognized by
the Chair will be asked to step forward to the lectern (if physically
able), identify themselves for the Board, including address, and state if
in opposition, in support or seeking clarification. Only brief, unrepeated
testimony relevant to the zoning issues of the application will be
allowed. It is the quality of the testimony, not the quantity that will be
of greatest value to the Board in its deliberations. The Chair will help
speakers comply with these requirements and may restrict individual
testimony out of respect for other speakers. Statements are to be
made to the Board. Speakers shall refrain from conversations with
the applicant or the audience. The Board may ask questions of the
speakers. Please note public comment on variance applications will be

also redesignated former Subsections H through L as Subsections F through J,
respectively.

limited to the legal standards set forth in the statute and bylaw. Brief
rebuttal may be allowed by the Chair.
At the close of testimony, the Board will thoroughly discuss the
application if necessary. Based on testimony and the Board's discussion,
the applicant may wish to modify the request or withdraw the request.
(See § 310-5.04.) Following discussion, several options are available
to the Board through the affirmative vote of four (4) voting members
including:
Continuation. Should the Board determine that additional
information is required, the public hearing would be continued to a
date certain. The applicant may be asked to supply the Board with
further facts, which can be reviewed by the public in the Zoning
Office. The applicant could also request a continuance.
(1)
Vote to close the public hearing. The Board will close the public
hearing if it is satisfied that all relevant testimony has been
received. The Board may chose to leave the record open for a
specific time period to receive written documentation for
clarification and review. Once the public hearing is closed, no
new testimony will be allowed unless the Board immediately votes
on its own initiative to reopen the public hearing for the sole
purpose to clarify any findings or conditions. However, the Board
may seek clarification or advice from Town or Special Counsel
without reopening the public hearing. After the public hearing is
closed, the Board has several options including:
Take action. After a full discussion of the application, the Board
shall make findings and vote to approve or deny the
application. Should there be an insufficient number of votes to
either approve or deny an application, the application shall be
deemed denied.
(a)
Take the matter under advisement. In cases where
documentation is complex or new documentation has been
provided at the public hearing or based on testimony, the
Board may wish to further review testimony and
documentation before rendering a decision. The Board will
take action at a subsequent public meeting, but not at an
advertised public hearing as all testimony has been received.
(b)
Request a draft decision from the Zoning Administrator. In
some cases, the Board may vote to request the Zoning
Administrator to draft a decision for review by the Board. The
Board will take action at a subsequent public meeting, but
not at an advertised public hearing as all testimony has been
received.
(c)

I.
J. Public hearings shall end at 9:30 p.m. unless extended by Board vote.
§ 310-5.03 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 310-5.04
280:687
§ 310-5.04. Withdrawal of applications.
The applicant may withdraw an application without prejudice at any time
prior to the publication of the notice of public hearing. An application may
be withdrawn, with or without prejudice, after the publication of the notice
of public hearing only by an affirmative vote of four (4) voting members.
§ 310-5.05. Administrative approvals.
Administrative approvals involve minor requests from applicants that would
otherwise require a special permit or a modification of a special permit. The
administrative approval process does not involve notification to abutters or
a public hearing. There are three (3) types of administrative approvals as
follows:
Board of Appeals. The Board may condition a special permit decision
to reserve the right to administratively approve specified changes to
the permit. The holder of a special permit may request the Board to
administratively approve an insubstantial change to an existing special
permit. Administrative approvals pursuant to this section shall be
noticed in the public meeting notice and discussed and decided in an
open meeting. (Note: A substantial change would require notification
to abutters and a public hearing in order to modify an existing special
permit.) An affirmative vote of four (4) voting members shall be
required. The voting members need not be the same members who
voted in the original decision.
A.
Board of Appeals and Zoning Administrator. The Board may condition
a special permit decision and delegate to the Zoning Administrator the
right to administratively approve certain details or minor changes to
the permit. The Zoning Administrator shall provide a written monthly
report to the Board of all administrative approvals pursuant to this
section.
B.
Zoning Administrator. ** As of November 12, 2018, this Zoning
Administrator approval process shall be discontinued until such time
as the Board approves its reinstatement by vote of said Board.** The
Zoning Administrator shall be delegated limited authority to grant
administrative approvals for residential or commercial requests that do
not exceed the lot coverage criteria set forth in § 240-69 and where
conditions become not more nonconforming as follows: [Amended
3-5-2016; 11-29-2018]
(1) Where no new rooms are created;
(2) Decks that are not enclosed that are within existing setbacks;
Three-season rooms without heat or plumbing that are within
existing setbacks;
(3)
Additions that do not change existing setbacks or create new
rooms; and
(4)
C.
§ 310-5.04 FALMOUTH CODE § 310-5.05
280:688
§ 310-5.06. Minutes; filing with Town Clerk.
The recording secretary shall prepare minutes of each meeting and public
hearing to be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and approved by the
Board at a subsequent meeting. The Zoning Administrator shall file the
approved minutes of each meeting and public hearing with the Town Clerk.
§ 310-6.00. Dispositions.
§ 310-6.01. Voting requirements.
A vote of four (4) voting members is required in order to grant a special
permit or variance or to overturn an order or decision of the Building
Commissioner or other public hearing action. Board administrative
approvals shall require an affirmative vote of four (4) voting members.
The voting members need not be the same members voting in the original
decision. An action to reopen a public hearing pursuant to § 310-6.03,
Reconsideration, (below) or to take action as a result of a reopened public
hearing requires an affirmative vote of four (4) of the voting members who
participated in the original public hearing. For all other matters, unless
expressly stated herein, a majority the members present is required to take
action.
§ 310-6.02. Decisions. [Amended 3-5-2016]
Decisions shall be signed by the Chair, or if unable the Vice Chair, or
if unable the Clerk. Draft decisions shall be made available for review
by the voting members prior to signature. In the event an application is
requested to be withdrawn without prejudice before or after testimony in a
public hearing, the Board herein allows the Zoning Administrator, after the
Board’s approval of said document, to sign the decision of withdrawal and
file the decision with the Town Clerk.
Small residential accessory structures that do not include habitable
space and not exceeding two hundred (200) square feet, including
sheds in front yards that are more than fifty (50) feet from the
street layout.
The Zoning Administrator shall provide a written monthly report to
the Board of all administrative approvals pursuant to this section.
Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the Zoning
Administrator, whether or not a party to the proceeding, or any
municipal office or board, may appeal to the Board of Appeals,
as provided in MGL c. 40A, § 14, within thirty (30) days after the
decision of the Zoning Administrator has been filed in the office
of the Town Clerk. Any appeal, application or petition filed with
said Zoning Administrator as to which no decision has been issued
within thirty-five (35) days from the date of filing shall be deemed
denied and shall be subject to appeal of the Board of Appeals as
provided in MGL c. 40A, § 8.

§ 310-5.05 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 310-6.03
280:689
§ 310-6.03. Reconsideration. [Amended 3-5-2016]
Upon written request for reconsideration from an aggrieved party and
with a signed waiver from applicant extending the fourteen-day (14-day)
requirement of a decision being filed, the Board may vote to reopen a public
hearing prior to the filing of a decision with the Town Clerk, only in the
case where a serious procedural defect (for example improper or ineffectual
notice of the original public hearing) has prevented, in the sole opinion of
the Board, a full and fair public hearing. Action to reopen must be taken
by an affirmative vote of four (4) of the voting members who participated
in the original public hearing. A reopened public hearing must satisfy the
notification requirements of MGL c. 40A § 11. Action taken during or as a
result of the reopened hearing requires an affirmative vote of four (4) of the
voting members who participated in the original public hearing.
§ 310-7.00. Miscellaneous. [Amended 3-5-2016]
§ 310-7.01. Interactions with other boards/Town Manager/Zoning
Administrator.
Only the Board as a whole has the ability, through the Zoning Administrator,
to interact with other boards, including, but not limited to, the Board of
Selectmen, Planning Board and Town Manager. No individual member or
officer is granted this authority. However, the Board may delegate certain
interactions to subcommittees or individual members. It must be
remembered that the Zoning Administrator is a department head and is
responsible to the Town Manager.
§ 310-7.02. Board practices.
Openness. All matters regarding the Zoning Board of Appeals should
be discussed in an open meeting by and between the members. The
members shall inform the Zoning Administrator of all discussions/
meetings with other boards or departments, and the Zoning
Administrator shall keep all members apprised of said discussions/
meetings.
A.
Recusal. Members should protect themselves from receiving
information about a pending or upcoming application or appeal outside
of a public hearing. Members who inadvertently receive such
information should recuse themselves from the public hearing on the
matter. Note, members who are also Town Meeting members are
allowed to fully participate at Town Meeting in any Article that may
have bearing on an application or appeal unless such participation
would violate the procedural due process rights of an applicant or
interested party. The Board or applicant may ask a member to recuse
at the time of a hearing; however, ultimately it is the member's own
decision whether or not to recuse. A refusal to recuse could lead to
court intervention, including an injunction or appeal.
B.
§ 310-6.03 FALMOUTH CODE § 310-7.02
280:690
§ 310-7.03. Board policies.
From time to time the Board may establish certain policies that may provide
guidance to the Board in the consideration of future applications. Said
policies may also provide guidance to applicants and assist in the
enforcement of Board decisions. Policies may only be established in an open
meeting of the Board and require the affirmative vote of four (4) members.
The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a catalogue of policies.
§ 310-7.04. Amendments of these rules.
These rules shall be amended only upon a majority vote of the Board.
Members must receive proposed amendments at least two (2) weeks prior
to voting. All amendments shall be dated and filed with the Town Clerk.

by the Board alone. The Board should not impose unreasonable or
unnecessary time or cost burdens on an applicant. Legal fees for general
representation of the Board or other local boards shall not be imposed on

The Board shall comply with any requirements of the Uniform Procurement
Act, MGL c. 30B by establishing a list of consultants if required. The list
shall be available to the public for inspection during normal business hours

Board. A review fee may only be imposed in compliance with applicable
law and the Board's rules. All fees assessed pursuant to 760 CMR
56.05(5)(b) shall be reasonable in light of:
(1) The complexity of the proposed project as a whole;
(2) The complexity of particular technical issues;
(3) The number of housing units proposed;
(4) The size and character of the site;
(5) The projected construction costs; and
Fees charged for similar consultants and scopes of work in the
area. As a general rule, the Board may not assess any fee greater
than the amount which might be appropriated from town or city
funds to review a project of similar type and scale in the town or
city.

B.
The Board has had an opportunity to propose conditions to mitigate the
project's impacts and to consider requested waivers; and
C.
The applicant has indicated that it does not agree to the proposed
condition(s) or Waiver denial(s) because they would render the project
uneconomic. A Board may not conduct review of a pro forma in order
to see whether a project would still be economic if the number of
dwelling units were reduced, unless such reduction is justified by a
valid health, safety, environmental, design, open space, planning, or
other local concern that directly results from the size of a project on a
particular site, consistent with 760 CMR 56.07(3).
D.

direction of the Board without further appropriation. Expenditures from this
special account shall be made only for services rendered in connection with
a specific project or projects for which a project review fee has been or will
be collected from the applicant. Accrued interest may also be spent for this
purpose. Failure of an applicant to pay a review fee within the stated time
period shall be grounds for denial of the comprehensive permit application.
§ 311-4.06. Repayment of excess funds.
At the completion of the Board's review of a project, any excess amount
in the account, including interest, attributable to a specific project shall
be repaid to the applicant or the applicant's successor in interest. A final
report of said account shall be made available to the applicant or applicant's
successor in interest. For the purpose of this rule, any person or entity
claiming to be an applicant's successor in interest shall provide the Board
with documentation establishing such succession in interest.

applicant. The hearing is deemed terminated when all public testimony has
been received and all information requested by the Board that it is entitled
to receive has been submitted. In making its decision, the Board shall take
into consideration the recommendations of local boards, but shall not be
required to adopt same. The Board shall file its decision within fourteen (14)

2.7
Findings. The Board of Health of the Town of Falmouth finds that:
The groundwater under lying this town is the sole source of its
existing and future water supply, including drinking water;
1.
The groundwater aquifer is integrally connected with and flows
into the surface waters, lake, streams and coastal estuaries which
constitute significant recreational and economic resources of the
town used for bathing and other water-related recreation, and
shellfishing and fishing;

on Cape Cod and in other Massachusetts towns, posing potential
public health and safety hazard and threatening economic losses to
the affected communities;
Unless preventive measures are adopted to prohibit discharge of
toxic and hazardous materials and to control their storage within
the town, further spills and discharges of such materials will
predictably occur, and with greater frequency and degree of hazard
by reason of increasing construction, commercial and industrial
development, population, and vehicular traffic in the Town of
Falmouth and on Cape Cod.

used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes.
Owners shall file with the Board of Health, on or before July 1,
1988, the size, type, age, and location of each tank, and the type
of fuel or chemical stored in them. Evidence of date of purchase
and installation, including Fire Department permit, if any, shall be

Testing.
The tank owner shall have each tank and its piping tested for
tightness fifteen (15) years after installation and annually after
twenty (20) years. A tank shall be tested by any final or precision
test, not involving air pressure, that can accurately detect a leak of

following: (1) the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice;
and (2) installation or use of an underground storage tank will not
adversely affect public or private water resources. In granting a
variance, the Board will take into consideration the direction of
the ground water flow, soil conditions, depth to ground water, size,
shape and slope of the lot, and existing and known future water
supplies.

Enforcement.
Any owner or operator who violates any provisions of this
regulation shall be subject to the penalties provided under MGL

Statement of purpose: Whereas there exists conclusive evidence that
tobacco smoke causes cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases,
negative birth outcomes, irritations to the eyes, nose and throat; and
whereas more than ninety-five percent (95%) of all smokers begin
smoking before the age of twenty-one (21) years [Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, "Youth Surveillance - United States 2000,"
50 MMWR 1 (Nov. 2000)]; and whereas nationally in 2000, sixty-nine
percent (69%) of middle school age children who smoke at least once a
A.
FHR-5.0 VEHICLES FOR HIRE FHR-6.0
280:709
month were not asked to show proof of age when purchasing cigarettes
(Id.); and whereas as ninety percent (90%) of those who provide
cigarettes to kids under eighteen (18) are themselves under twenty-one
(21); and whereas the United States Department of Health and Human
Services has concluded that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or
heroin; and whereas despite state laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco
products to minors, access by minors to tobacco products is a major
problem; and whereas the sale of tobacco products and nicotine
delivery products are incompatible with the mission of health care
institutions because they are detrimental to the public health and
undermine efforts to educate patients on the safe and effective use of
medication; and whereas there is not sufficient evidence to show that
non-FDA regulated smokeless nicotine products are harmless and such
products sometimes become gateways to cigarette use; now, therefore
it is the intention of the Falmouth Board of Health to regulate the
access of tobacco and smokeless nicotine products.
Authority: The Falmouth Board of Health pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31,
adopts these regulations as reasonable health regulations designed
to protect and improve the health of its residents. This regulation
supersedes the Falmouth Board of Health regulations promulgated on
September 1, 1998, and those of May 24, 2013.

FHR-7.0. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and nicotine
vapors. [Effective 11-2006; amended 2-22-2016]
Effective date: These regulations shall take effect 45 days after the date
of publication.
Q.
Findings. The 1986 Surgeon General's Report on "The Health
Consequences of Involuntary Smoking" clearly documents that
nonsmokers are placed at risk for developing disease as a result of
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke. In
1993, the Environmental Protection Agency classified environmental
tobacco smoke as a known human carcinogen. Numerous studies have
found that tobacco smoke and nicotine vapors are major contributors
to indoor air pollution, and that breathing them may be a cause of
cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases, negative birth outcomes and
irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. Of particular concern is the
workplace environment of nonsmokers and nonvapors, where they may
be subjected to sustained involuntary exposure.
7.1.
Authority. The Town of Falmouth pursuant to MGL c. 270, § 22, and

account shall be made to carry out the Board's responsibilities under
state and location regulations and only in connection with the specific
project or projects for which a consultant's fee has been or will be
collected from the applicant.
4.
Failure to pay fee. Failure of an applicant to pay a consultant's fee shall

selection of the outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen within
fourteen (14) days of notice of the selection. The grounds for such
an appeal shall be limited to claims that the consultant selected has
a conflict of interest or does not possess the minimum required
qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall consist either of an
educational degree in or related to, the field at issue or three (3) or
more years of practice in the field at issue or a related field.
7.
Time limit for action. The required time limit for action upon an
application by the Board shall be extended by the duration of the
administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the
Board of Selectmen within one (1) month following the filing of the

Septic system location and construction.
Septic Systems Near Surface Waters and Wetlands
Purpose: On-site sewage disposal systems designed to meet 310 CMR,
15.00: The State Environmental Code Title 5, Minimum Requirements
for the Subsurface Disposal of Sanitary Sewage have not proven to be
adequate protection from viruses, pathogens, and other contaminants
of groundwater and surface water particularly in areas where there
is a lack of filtration due to rapidly percolating soils. Scientists have
observed virus entrainment in groundwater to distances of greater
than two hundred (200) feet from where they were introduced to the
subsurface through a conventional on-site sewage disposal system,
and in saturated or groundwater flow, viruses can travel unattenuated
in medium-to-coarse sands for distances exceeding the minimum
requirements set forth in 310 CMR 15.211. Human consumption of
viruses, pathogens, and other contaminants which enter shellfish
resource areas, swimming areas, and/or within zones of contribution
to public water supply wells can place the public at risk to disease.
Prohibition of Systems within one hundred (100) feet of Resource
Areas that Serve New Construction
No septic system leaching facility serving new construction as
defined in 310 CMR 15.002 shall be constructed within one
hundred (100) feet of a surface water or wetlands (as defined in
310 CMR 15.002 The State Environmental Code, Title 5: Minimum
Requirements for the Subsurface Disposal of Sanitary Sewage)
or within one hundred (100) feet of a water body or a bordering
vegetated wetland as described in 310 CMR 10.00: Wetlands
Protection. Further, no system shall be located on a coastal beach,
barrier beach or dune as described in 310 CMR 10.00: Wetlands
Protection Act. The minimum distance of a completely sealed
septic tank shall be fifty (50) feet from a surface water or wetland
as defined above.

Conditions that Shall Apply to Repair of Septic Systems Within one
hundred (100) feet of Surface Waters or Wetlands.
2.
15.6
FHR-15.0 FALMOUTH CODE FHR-15.0
280:732
The following conditions shall be required for the repair of those
septic systems proposed within one hundred (100) feet of surface
waters or wetlands. These regulations proceed on the principle
that localized hydraulic loading resulting from gravity fed soil
absorption systems results in decreased hydraulic retention,
decreased wastewater treatment and removal of pathogens. This
situation compromises the public health near sensitive receptor
sites such as surface waters, including wetlands. This regulation
incorporates the principle that increased vertical separation
between the bottom of the soil absorption system or equalized
loading over the soil absorption system, afforded by pressure
distribution networks, or alternative technologies may
compensate for horizontal setback deficiencies. Accordingly,
where the health agent has determined that all feasible means
have been taken to minimize the incursions toward the resource
area, the following design features shall be incorporated.
Notwithstanding the incorporation of the following design
features, the health agent may, at his/her discretion refer any plan
to the Board of Health for a hearing when, in their opinion, the
applicant has not adequately demonstrated that all feasible means
have been taken to minimize excursions toward resource areas.
Where no increased design flow is proposed and where the
bottom elevation of the soil absorption system (SAS) is greater
than ten (10) feet from the adjusted seasonal high groundwater
and where the maximum achievable horizontal separation
between the SAS and a surface water or wetland is at least fifty
(50) feet, but less than one hundred (100) feet, the applicant
shall demonstrate that they have achieved the maximum
separation between the soil absorption system and the
resource area and the approval shall be subject to the
conditions of FHR 15.5(3) a,d,g,h,i,j and k.
a)
Where no increased flow is proposed and the bottom elevation
of the soil absorption system (SAS) is less than ten (10) feet
but at least five (5) feet from the adjusted seasonal high
groundwater (but is otherwise in compliance with 310 CMR
15.202) and where the maximum achievable horizontal
separation between the SAS and a surface water or wetland is
at least seventy-five (75) feet but less than one hundred (100)
feet the applicant shall demonstrate that they have achieved
the maximum separation between the soil absorption system
and the resource area and the approval shall be subject to the
conditions of FHR 15.5(3) a,b,d,g,h,i,j and k.
b)
Where no increased flow is proposed and the bottom elevation
of the soil absorption system (SAS) is less than ten (10) feet
but at least five (5) feet from the adjusted seasonal high
groundwater (but otherwise in compliance with 310 CMR
15.202) and where the maximum achievable horizontal

separation between the SAS and a surface water or wetland
is at least fifty (50) feet but less than seventy-five (75) feet a
pressure distribution system shall be required that conforms
to guidelines issued by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection. The approval shall be subject to the
conditions of FHR 15.5(3) a,b,d,g,h,i,j and k.
Where no increased design flow is proposed and where the
bottom elevation of the soil absorption system (SAS) is greater
than ten (10) feet from the adjusted seasonal high groundwater
and where the maximum achievable horizontal separation
between the SAS and a surface water or wetland is less than
fifty (50) feet but at least forty (40) feet, a pressure distribution
system shall be required that conforms to guidelines issued by
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.
The approval shall be subject to the conditions of FHR 15.5(3)
a,b,d,g,h,i,j and k.
d)
Where no increased design flow is proposed and where the
bottom of the soil absorption system (SAS) is less than ten
(10) feet from the adjusted seasonal high groundwater (but
otherwise in compliance with 310 CMR 15.202) and where
the maximum achievable horizontal separation between the
SAS and a surface water or wetland is less than fifty (50)
feet but at least forty (40) feet, an alternative on-site septic
system in conjunction, a disinfection unit having no chemical
residual, and a pressure distribution system shall be required
that conforms by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection. The approval shall be subject to the
conditions of FHR 15.5(3) a,b,d,g,h,i,j and k.
e)
Criteria for determining a septic system repair or replacement. To
protect the public health against potential sources of contamination
of the ground and surface waters in the Town of Falmouth, the Board
of Health adopts the following regulation. The Board of Health may
require the repair or replacement of a septic system if any of the
following apply:
The results of an inspection of the septic system pursuant to 310
CMR 15.300- 310 CMR 15.304 reveal that the system is failed.
1)
Any of the following observations is made independent of a
complete inspection pursuant to 310 CMR 15.300- 310 CMR 15.3:
there is evidence of sewage flow to the surface of the ground,
there is structural damage to the components of the system which
prevent it from functioning as required, the system was pumped
more than two (2) times in a ninety-day period (excluding
maintenance pumping of grease traps), there is evidence of
breakout, there was sewage back-up into the house resulting from
a non-functioning leaching area, the standing liquid level in the
leaching facility(s) is indicated to have persisted by staining within

two (2) inches of the invert pipe elevation, the system is damaged
or destroyed by storm or flood.
In the case where the septic system serving a facility is located
less than one hundred (100) feet from a surface water or wetland
and the system is comprised of a cesspool or cesspools and where
the estimated seasonal high groundwater is less than two (2) feet
from the bottom elevation of any cesspool, the system shall be
considered failed and shall be replaced with a system in compliance
with 310 CMR 15.000 et seq. Observations of these conditions
in the course of an inspection pursuant to 310 CMR 15.300 -
15.305 shall be referenced on the certification statement part of
the inspection form in the words "Needs Further Evaluation by
Approving Authority."
3)
Soil absorption systems equipped with monitoring ports installed
pursuant to FHR 15.2(3) shall be deemed failed if the ponding
level is indicated to be eighty percent (80%) or greater in height
compared to the effective designed sidewall depth in the case of
trenches or greater than five (5) inches in height in the case of
leaching bed designs. For purpose of this calculation, the inspector
shall measure from the soil or soil-aggregate interface to the lowest
invert elevation of the discharge lateral. This latter elevation may
be calculated from the design plan and take into consideration
the location of the observation port relative to the lowest invert
elevation of the discharge lateral.
4)
Purpose of regulation. Whereas: floor drains in industrial and
commercial facilities are often tied to a system leading to a leaching
structure (e.g., dry well, cesspool, leach field) or a septic system;
and poor management practices and accidental and/or intentional
discharges may lead petroleum and other toxic or hazardous materials
into these drainage systems in facilities managing these products; and
improper maintenance or inappropriate use of these systems may allow
the passage of contaminants or pollutants entering the drain to
discharge from the leaching structure or septic system to the ground;
and discharges of hazardous wastes and other pollutants to floor drains
leading to leaching structures and septic systems have repeatedly
threatened surface and ground water quality throughout
Massachusetts; and surface and ground water resources in the Town of
Falmouth contribute to the Town's drinking water supplies; the Town
of Falmouth adopts the following regulation, under its authority as
specified in Section II as a preventative measure for the purposes
of: preserving and protecting the Town of Falmouth's drinking water
resources from discharges of pollutants to the ground via floor drains,
and minimizing the threat of economic losses to the Town due to such
discharges.

§ FPWR-5 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § FPWR-5
280:751
Ten (10) inches of approved gravel shall be placed in the trench
and the remaining two (2) inches shall be filled with temporary
bituminous surface. Road surface shall be precut to avoid
damaging surfaces surrounding the trench.
The backfilled material in the trench must be mechanically tamped
in six-inch layers; or if backfill material does not contain too much
clay, it may instead be thoroughly puddled unless otherwise
directed by the Public Works Department. If the temporary road
surface is not placed the first day, then as soon as it is consistent
with the permanency of the work or directed by the Public Works
Department, the gravel subbase shall be excavated to the required
grade in order to place two (2) inches of bituminous surface. The
temporary pavement shall be placed and raked to a uniform
surface, rolled to the thickness and to grade that will match the
existing bituminous road surface.
(2)
The applicant shall maintain the temporary surfacing and shall
promptly fill with similar material any depressions and holes that
may occur so as to keep the surfacing in a safe and satisfactory
condition for traffic.
(3)

two (2) courses. The binder (base course) shall be two (2)81 inches
in depth and the top course shall be one and one-half (1 1/2) inches
(3)
E.
81.NOTE: Base shall not be less than existing roadway base course and not less than two (2)
inches.
§ FPWR-5 FALMOUTH CODE § FPWR-5
280:752
in depth. The minimum total thickness of both courses, measured
after rolling, shall be three and one-half (3 1/2) inches. The base
course of a permanent pavement shall be placed and carefully
raked to a minimum surface and thoroughly rolled to the required
thickness. Before placing the base course of the permanent
pavement, the edge of the original bituminous surfacing shall
receive an application of approved asphalt emulsion so that the
new pavement material may be properly bonded to the old. The top
course of the permanent paving shall be placed to a grade that will
match the existing bituminous surface after rolling.
The permanent paving shall not overlap the existing pavement and
will not have to be applied with a mechanical spreader unless
otherwise directed.
(4)
The applicant shall furnish, place, grade and compact bituminous
concrete pavement of Class I Type I-I as shown and specified in the
latest Massachusetts State Department of Public Works Standard
Specifications for Highway and Bridges.

extensive it may be required, upon completion of patching
trenches, to overlay the affected area for the full width of roadway
and at least thirty (30) feet beyond the affected area with one (1)
inch of dense graded bituminous concrete.
(6)
All lawn surfaces over the trench shall be replaced with sod or loam
and reseeded to grade. All sidewalks dug through shall be carefully
patched after backfilling. A bituminous concrete sidewalk shall be
squared off and patched with the same material and rolled so as to
provide a continuous smooth surface. Cement concrete sidewalks
shall be repaired by making a new concrete block or blocks through
which the trench passes. Preformed expansion joints, when
deemed necessary, will be installed against buildings, walls, steps,
foundations or existing concrete blocks. The new cement concrete
square shall be made by air-entrained Class "A" (3,500-pound) mix
or better and be matched in color with the remaining sidewalk
as nearly as possible. All concrete must be cured by covering
with material in accordance with the best known concrete curing
procedures. All walks shall be laid over a minimum of twelve (12)
inches of well compacted gravel. Cement concrete shall be treated
with silicone or linseed oil sealer for salt damage prevention. The
applicant shall be responsible for repairing any damage to public
utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, etc.) or to town
trees, shrubs, poles or signs which may be disturbed or damaged
during the course of the work or on account thereof. The applicant
shall be responsible for the maintenance of the street opening
excavation trench for one (1) year after the date of completing
the installation except where such maintenance is made necessary
by the act or neglect of another. Exceptions to the permanent
paving requirement of the Department of Public Works of the Town
(7)
§ FPWR-5 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § FPWR-5

of Falmouth may be made only for state or federal government
agencies.
All restoration of cement patch paving areas shall be done at the
expense of the applicant and must meet with specification of the
Department of Public Works.
(8)
In instances when open cut is permitted, provisions for patching
will require, wherever approved by the Director, that six-inch
reinforced or precast concrete slab be laid over the backfilled
trench extending one (1) foot beyond either side of the edge of
surface and allowing for a three-inch bituminous concrete Type I-I
surface.
(9)
When approved, the concrete slab may be cast-in-place conforming
to Massachusetts Standard Specifications for Class "F" Cement
Concrete and, additionally, shall be high-early strength. The slab
shall have steel reinforcing for tensile strength placed in
accordance with good engineering practices. The applicant must
place temporary heavy duty plating adequate to carry heavy traffic
over the trench area until the concrete is sufficiently cured.
(10)
Consideration may under certain limited conditions be given to
the elimination of the concrete patch, allowing underground utility
installations to be made where the applicant agrees to replace
foundation and base material in kind, and to maintain satisfactorily
a permanent (plant mixed hot asphalt) bituminous concrete Type
I-I patch for a period of one (1) year except at which time the
original permanent patch with approved material. In this case a
specific bond may be required to insure the continued maintenance
of the permanent (temporary) patch and the construction of the
permanent patch at the end of the one-year period.
