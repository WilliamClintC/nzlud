
Homewood, IL Code of Ordinances


Village of
Homewood, Illinois
MUNICIPAL CODE



Includes Ordinances Through MC-977



PREFACE



This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent
ordinances of the Village of Homewood, Illinois. 1



Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as
supplemented through August 26, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by
the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history
note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the
adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back
of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as
supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.



The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical
order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to
facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the
state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is
included at the back of this Code.



   Chapter and Section Numbering System



The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system
used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists
of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the
chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the
section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered
1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each
section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can
be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments.
For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically
come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section
would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in
the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the
chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed
at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number
shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be
included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken
that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including
new chapters.



   Page Numbering System



The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters
to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain
portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the
number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the
number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the
case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the
colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts
of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this
time, and their corresponding prefixes:

   Index



The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item
has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
generally used by local government officials and employees. There are
numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts
to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.



   Looseleaf Supplements



A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication
will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly
edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages
will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication.



   Acknowledgments



The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Ray Gosack, Director of Management
Services, and Mr. Walter Cummings, Village Attorney, for their cooperation
and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a
Municipal Code which will make the active law of the village readily
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the
day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

   Unless otherwise provided in this Code, this Code applies to acts
performed within the corporate limits of the village. Provisions of this Code

limits prescribed by law, where the law confers power on the village to

(Code 1965, § 1.07)



Sec. 1-4. Catchlines of sections and other headings.



   The catchlines of the several subsections and sections, and the
headings of chapters, articles and divisions of this Code are intended as
mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the subsection, section, chapter,
article or division, and shall not be deemed or taken to be a substantive
part of such subsections, sections, chapters, articles or divisions, nor,
unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such
subsections, sections, chapters, articles or divisions, including the
catchlines or other headings, are amended or reenacted.



Sec. 1-5. Amendments to Code.



   (a)   Reference to Code. Any additions or amendments to this Code

clerk to keep at least one copy of this Code which he shall mark in the
following manner: Whenever any ordinance which amends or makes an addition to
this Code is passed and approved, he shall note on the margin of the sections
amended that the amendment has been made and where the amendment may be found
in an amendment book, and in the case of an addition, he shall make in the
appropriate place a notation that such addition has been made with a similar
reference to the amendment book. All ordinances which amend or make an
addition to this Code shall be numbered consecutively, with the prefix "MC."
The village clerk shall keep copies of all such ordinances in a separate
amendment book, with a reference thereon as to the place where the original
record may be found in the record of ordinances which the clerk is required
to keep by statute.



(Code 1965, § 1.02)



Sec. 1-6. Supplementation of Code.



   (a)   By contract or by village personnel, supplements to this Code
shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the village
board. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of
permanent and general ordinances passed by the village board during the
period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.
The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly
into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become
obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that,
when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of
the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.



   (b)   In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the
Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission
thereof from reprinted pages.



   (c)   When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier
(meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the
supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts
of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so
to embody them into a unified Code.  For example, the codifier may:



      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate
subdivisions.



      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for
sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and
make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.



      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other
subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate
new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.



      (4)   Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the
same meaning to “this chapter,” “this article,” “this division,”
etc., as the case may be, or to “sections ________ to ________”
(inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody
the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code).



      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve
the original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of
new chapters inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make
any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the
supplement or already embodied in the Code.



Sec. 1-7. Altering Code.



   It shall be unlawful for any person in the village to change or amend,
by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or
delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any
manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the village to be
misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished
as provided in section 1-11.



Sec. 1-8. Separability of provisions of Code.



   Each section, paragraph, sentence, clause and provision of this Code is
separable and, if any provision is held unconstitutional or invalid for any
reason, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this Code nor any
part of this Code, other than that part affected by such decision.



(Code 1965, § 1.10)



Sec. 1-9. References and notes.



   Cross references, state law references, editor's notes and history
notes are by way of explanation only and shall not be deemed a part of the
text of any section.



Sec. 1-10. Copies of Code on file.



   Copies of this Code shall be kept on file in the village clerk’s
office for inspection by the public at all reasonable hours.



(Code 1965, § 1.12)



Sec. 1-11. General penalty.



   (a)   Standard penalty. Unless another penalty is expressly provided
by this Code for any particular provision, section or chapter, any person
violating any provision of this Code, or any rule or regulation adopted or
issued in pursuance thereof, or any provision of this Code adopted herein by
reference shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not less than
$25.00 nor more than $750.00 and the costs of prosecution. Upon default of
payment of any fine, sanction or costs imposed by this Code, any fees or
costs incurred by the village with respect to attorneys or private collection
agents retained by the municipal attorney shall be charged to the offender.



   (b)   Same offense. In all cases where the same offense is
punishable or created by different clauses or sections of this Code, the
prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed, but not more than one
recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense. The
revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or
penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced.



   (c)   Continuing violations. Each act of violation and every day
during or upon which a violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate
offense.



   (d)   Applicability of penalty. The penalty provided by this section
or any section of this Code applies to the amendment of any section of this
Code or any Code adopted by reference to which the penalty relates, whether
or not such penalty is reenacted in the amending ordinance, unless otherwise
provided or unless the penalty is specifically repealed in the amendment.



   (e)   Reference to sections. Reference to any section of this Code
shall be understood also to



refer to and include the penalty section relating thereto, unless otherwise
expressly provided.



   (f)   Failure of officers to perform duties. The failure of any
officer or employee to perform any official duty imposed by this Code shall
not subject such officer or employee to any fine or penalty imposed for
violation of this Code, unless the intention to impose such fine or penalty
is specifically expressed in the provision creating such duty.

   (g)   Whenever a check made payable to the Village of Homewood is
returned by a financial institution for any reason (i.e., insufficient funds,
missing signature, a closed account, etc.), the account to which the payment
was credited will be charged a $25.00 service fee by the Village of
Homewood.  The issuer of the non-cashable check is responsible for redeeming
the check immediately using only cash, cashier's check or money order.



   Whenever an electronic payment has been authorized and the payment is
not honored by the financial institution, the account to which the payment
was credited shall be charged a $25.00 service fee by the Village.  The
account's responsible party shall be notified of the returned electronic
payment and shall make arrangements to settle the account immediately using
only cash, cashier's check or money order.



   Whenever payment is made using a credit card or a debit card and the
financial institution that issued the card subsequently denies or refuses to
honor said transaction for any reason, the village shall impose a $25.00
service fee.  The account's responsible party shall be notified of the
denied payment and shall immediately settle the account using only cash or
certified funds.



(MC-806, § 1, 8-12-08; MC-878, § 1, 10-23-12)



Sec. 1-12. Responsibility for acts.



   Every person concerned in the commission of any act prohibited by this
Code, whether he directly commits the act, or prosecutes, counsels, aids, or
abets in its commission, may be prosecuted and, on conviction, is punishable
as if he had directly committed the act.



(Code 1965, § 1.09)



Sec. 1-13. Ordinances and other matters not affected by adoption of Code.



   (a)   The repeal provided for in section 2 of the ordinance adopting
this Code shall not affect any of the following:



      (1)   Ordinances authorizing contracts for the issue of
municipal warrants, notes or bonds;



      (2)   Ordinances levying taxes or making special assessments;



      (3)   Ordinances appropriating funds or establishing salaries;



      (4)   Ordinances granting franchises or special rights to
persons or corporations, and ordinances relating to railroads or public
activities except as provided for herein;



      (5)   Ordinances relating to the establishment, dedication,
opening, grading, naming, improvement, altering, widening or vacating of any
streets, alleys or sidewalks, parks or public grounds;



      (6)   Ordinances respecting the annexation of territory to the
village, or the conveyance or acceptance of real property or easements in
real property by or from the village, or the location of shorelines;



      (7)   Ordinances authorizing or relating    to particular
public improvements;



      (8)   Ordinances relating to elections or  voting precincts;



      (9)   The zoning ordinance; and



      (10)   Any other special ordinances not in conflict with the
provisions of this Code.



   (b)   The provisions of this Code, so far as they are the same in
substance as those of heretofore existing ordinances, are continuations of
such ordinances and not new enactments. Any act done, offense committed, or
right ordained, accrued or acquired, or liability, penalty, forfeiture or
punishment incurred prior hereto shall not be affected, but may be enjoyed,
asserted, enforced, prosecuted or inflicted as fully and to the same extent
as if the repeal had not been in effect, providing that any proceedings
thereafter shall conform to this Code in force at the time of the proceeding,
so far as practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment is mitigated
by any provision of this Code, each provision may be, by the consent of any
party affected, applied to any judgment or verdict rendered after this Code
takes effect. The preceding sentence shall apply to all repeals, and nothing
contained in this section shall be construed as abating any action now
pending under any ordinance repealed in this Code, or abating or modifying
any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any
person, or as waiving any rights of the village under any ordinance
provisions existing at the time of passage of this Code.



(Code 1965, § 1.05)



Sec. 1-14. Ordinances repealed not reenacted.



   No ordinance or part of any ordinance heretofore repealed shall be
considered revived, reordained or reenacted by virtue of this Code, unless
specifically reenacted in this Code. The repeal of any curative or validating
ordinance does not impair or affect any cure or validation already affected
thereby.

two bids in question is $500.00 or less, and provided that notice of this
preference has been provided as part of the bid specifications. This

general description of the work, supplies or materials, but a detailed
description and/or plans and specifications shall be on file in the village
manager's office for inspection. The advertisement may call for each bid to
be accompanied by a cashier's or certified check in an amount equal to ten

   (b)   The sale, transfer, assignment, or gift of more than a five
percent (5%) interest in any business entity to a person or entity not listed
in the existing license application shall constitute a change in ownership
and require surrender of the current liquor license and submission of a new
application pursuant to Section 10-53 of this Code. Failure to surrender the
current license and submit a new application prior to a change in ownership
or control as defined in this paragraph shall constitute grounds to revoke

chicken coop, the outdoor enclosed feeding/grazing area or the installation
of a prefabricated chicken coop; the fee for the building permit will be the
same as for a shed. If electricity is installed to the chicken coop it must
be installed underground; extension cords or above ground wire are not
permitted. Any electrical work requires an electrical permit; the fee shall
be the same as for an accessory structure.



   (c)   Chicken coops shall be located only in a rear yard a minimum
of three feet from any lot line and shall be at least 30' from residential
structures not occupied by the licensee. Chicken coops shall be located at
least ten feet from the principal building and a minimum of five feet from
all other buildings on the licensed premises and abutting properties.
Existing non-residential structures may be allowed for the housing of hens
upon staff review.



   (d)   Chicken coops shall be constructed of solid materials on all
sides, including roof and door(s); the chicken coop must be constructed in
such a manner so as to protect the hens from predators and trespassers,
provide adequate ventilation to minimize odors, allow easy ingress and egress
for hens and protection from weather elements including cold temperatures.



   (e)   Hens may be allowed outside of the chicken coop between dawn
and dusk only in an enclosed, covered area no larger than 32 square feet and
no taller than six feet. Such area may only be located in a rear yard a
minimum of three feet from any lot line and at least 30' from residential
structures not occupied by the licensee. The screening enclosing this area
must be buried at least 12" deep and 6" flat to prevent predators from
digging under the fence. The material and the structural requirements of the
screening shall be consistent with Section 22.95, Construction Requirements;
chicken wire shall not be used for screening. If hardware cloth or welded
wire mesh is used for screening, it must be a minimum of 19 gauge wire. To
accommodate free range hens the outside enclosure may be provided through the
use of a mobile screened enclosure commonly referred to as a chicken tractor.
All areas used for the feeding and grazing shall be maintained to prevent
soil erosion and runoff to neighboring properties. All chicken coops and
enclosed feeding/grazing areas shall be maintained in good, structurally
sound repair and in a neat, clean, presentable and attractive condition.

within village limits, whether single-family, multi-family, commercial,
manufacturing, institutional, planned unit developments, or otherwise, shall
be reviewed and inspected by the village engineer or when directed by the
village board, by a consulting engineer employed by the village for a
particular project. The costs of such engineering plan review and
inspections, when performed by a consulting engineer, are hereby passed on by
the village as follows; Where a subdivision is required under this article,
the subdivider shall pay all such costs incurred by the village as defined in
subsection (c) of this section. Where no subdivision is required, the owner
of the property in question shall pay all such costs incurred by the village
as defined in subsection (c) of this section.



   (b)   Designation of engineer. In reviewing any of the types of
projects listed in subsection (a) of this section, the engineering staff,
planning staff or Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the
village board may direct the village manager to engage a consulting engineer

consultant charges to the village plus a 10% administrative charge.



   (d)   Expenses to be paid prior to permit issuance. With the
exception of inspection costs, no building permit shall be issued until all
such expenses incurred by the village have been paid to the village by the
appropriate party. Inspection costs shall be billed monthly and shall be paid
to the village in each case no later than 30 days after billing. The
developers shall have their respective engineers make ongoing inspections on

rehabilitated building shall be issued until the Inspection Services Division
supervisor or his designee certifies that the lot final grading,
establishment of grass/sod, and landscaping all comply with the plans
approved by the village, hereinafter referred to as the “approved plans.”



   (b)   Notwithstanding the above, if the lot final grading,
establishment of grass/sod, and landscaping are not yet completed according
to the approved plans because of circumstances beyond the developer’s
control, a builder/owner may request and the Inspection Services Division
supervisor or his designee may issue a conditional certificate of occupancy,
provided that each of the following conditions has been satisfied:



      (1)   The applicant has deposited with the village cash, a
surety bond in a form acceptable to the village or an unconditional letter of
credit, in a form acceptable to the village, equal to 150% of the cost of
completing final grading, establishment of grass/sod, and landscaping
according to the approved plans. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining a written bid to complete the work from the contractor who is to
perform the work. The Inspection Services Division supervisor or his designee
shall then calculate the amount of security required based upon this bid; and



      (2)   The applicant and the Inspection Services Division
supervisor have agreed on a timeframe for the applicant to complete the final
grading, establishment of grass/sod, and landscaping, not to exceed six (6)
months; and



      (3)   The Inspection Services Division supervisor has
determined that allowing temporary occupancy of the building, structure, or
improvement will pose no hazard to the potential users or occupants thereof,
nor to the public in general.



   (c)   Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
section shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that is will not be canceled without prior
notice to the village and the builder/owner;

      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and
within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



   (d)   If all final grading, establishment of grass/sod, and
landscaping are not completed within the agreed upon timeframe, the village
may complete or cause completion of the final grading, establishment of
grass/sod, and landscaping, and deduct all actual costs and expenses to
complete this work from the security held by the village. The owner’s
security, less any amount used by the village to complete the final grading,
establishment of grass/sod, and landscaping according to the approved plans,
shall be refunded to the owner.

lines in these zones may be constructed of barbed wire. Barbed wire shall not
be used, installed or constructed on fences fronting on any street. However,
the village, public utilities, the park district, school districts, golf
courses, the United States Government facilities and owners of property on
which hazardous operations exist, after first obtaining permission of the
village board, may erect barbed wire along fences fronting on public streets

requirements of this section, he shall order the owner or occupier of the
premises to make the necessary repairs or improvements within 30 days. Should
the owner or occupier of the premises fail to make repairs or improvements as
directed, he shall be in violation of this code and the building inspection
shall cause a complaint to be issued and processed against said owner or
occupier.

ARTICLE X.  CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION REGULATIONS



Sec. 22-273. General purpose and intent.



   It is concluded that equity ownership of multiple-family dwellings is a
positive development for the Village of Homewood (hereinafter “village”)
and, within certain limits, such ownership should be encouraged.



   Because of the unique nature of condominium ownership and the age of
the existing multiple family dwelling stock in the village, it is further
concluded that the quality of housing and the rights of the condominium
purchaser should be protected to a greater extent than the protections
provided under existing laws.



   The village has the authority to introduce regulation in the
condominium conversion process.



   Therefore, the purpose and intent of this article is to introduce
regulatory elements into the condominium conversion process that are aimed at
the protection of the rights of the condominium purchasers and preserving and
improving the quality of housing in an effort to encourage orderly
development of the condominium concept in the village.  Further, this
article is intended to facilitate code inspections by the village and, thus,
to reduce the possibility of a condominium containing material defects that
would have an adverse effect on the safety of its occupants or neighboring
property, would increase on-street vehicle density or would place unexpected
burdens on unit buyers.

changes in or corrections to initial application data shall be rendered as
required and shall be retroactive to the date of such change. Forms of
licenses and permits shall be prescribed and furnished by the village manager.



(Code 1965, § 41.01(c))



Sec. 26-34. Issuance.



   (a)   Generally. All licenses or permits, unless  otherwise
designated  in  this  Code,  shall be  granted and  signed by the 
village manager or  his designee.  Any application may be ordered by the
board of trustees to be presented to and approved by the board before
issuance of a permit or license. Any applicant for a license or permit, upon
request, shall be entitled to appeal to the board of trustees in connection
with the village manager's denial of an application.



   (b)   Refusal to grant or renew. The village may refuse to grant and
renew any license:



      (1)   If the applicant, any corporate officer of the
applicant, any partner of the applicant in the activity sought to be licensed
or any agent of the applicant who will represent the applicant in connection
with the activities sought to be licensed has been convicted of a felony.



      (2)   If the business or activities sought to be licensed is
deemed to be one that would constitute a breach of the peace or a detriment;
a menace to the health, safety or welfare of the public; or a disturbance of
the peace or comfort of the residents of the village, if it were licensed.



      (3)   If the business or activities sought to be licensed
would be conducted in violation of any laws of the United States or the state
or ordinance of the village.



      (4)   If the business or activities sought to be licensed
would, if licensed, cause a reduction in value of nearby or surrounding
residential or commercially used property.



      (5)   If any applicant for a license or renewal of a license
has outstanding fees, fines, taxes, or debts due to the village, including
but not limited to water and sewer charges, places for eating tax, hotel
accommodations tax, or fines imposed after administrative adjudication of a
local ordinance violation. If the proposed licensee is a corporation, limited
liability company or similar entity, the term “applicant” as used in this
subsection shall include any stockholder, member, or partner owning at least
a five percent interest in the licensed entity.



(Code 1965, § 41.01(d))  (MC-948, § 1, 2-23-16)



Sec. 26-35. Bond.



   When a bond is required for the issuance of any license or permit, such

village clerk before the license or permit is issued. The village manager may
in any case require an appropriate bond from a licensee where deemed
necessary to protect the village. If a license is denied, the bond will be
refunded.



(Code 1965, § 41.01(e))



Sec. 26-36. Investigations and inspections.



   (a)   Upon the receipt of an application for a license or permit
where ordinances of the village necessitate an inspection or investigation

The officer charged with the duty of making the investigation or inspection
shall make a written report thereon.



   (b)   The director of community development shall make or cause to
be made an inspection in regard to licenses in the connection with the
handling of food, the preventing of nuisances, the spread of disease, and for
the protection of health. The building inspector shall make or cause to be
made all required inspections relative to the construction of buildings or
other structures. All other investigations except where otherwise provided,
shall be made by the chief of police or by some other officer designated by
the manager. Whenever inspections of the premises used for or in connection
with the operation of a licensed business, occupation or activity are
provided for or required by this Code, or are reasonably necessary to secure
compliance with any ordinance provision, it shall be the duty of the
licensee, or the person in charge of the premises to be inspected, to admit
thereto for the purpose of making the inspection any officer or employee of
the village who is authorized or directed to make such inspection at any
reasonable time that admission is requested



   (c)   Whenever an analysis of any commodity or material is
reasonably necessary to ensure conformance with any ordinance provision, it
shall be the duty of the licensee of the village whose business is governed
by such provision to give to any authorized officer or employee of the
village requesting the same, sufficient samples of such material or commodity
for such analysis upon request.



(Code 1965, § 41.01(f); MC-800, § 1, 3-11-08)



Sec. 26-37. Fees.



   (a)   The fees required for a license or permit must be paid prior
to issuance of a license or permit, unless the license or permit provides
otherwise, in which case payment shall be made in accordance with the
requirements of the license or permit. If a license is not issued, the fee
will be refunded. No license fee shall be accepted for less than the full
amount due; provided, however, that the license fee for any commercial
establishment first commencing operation on or after November 1 of any year
shall be reduced by 50 percent, excluding food inspection fees established in
paragraph (b) below. Unless otherwise provided, no rebate or refund of any
license fee shall be made because of discontinuance, failure or other
operational interruption of any commercial establishment. The license fee
shall be set forth under each individual section of this chapter; provided,
however, that those businesses licensed on a square footage basis shall pay a
fee based on the following schedule:



0 - 5,000 square feet of  useable area          $100.00



Over 5,000 square feet of useable area       $200.00



   (b) Whenever a business includes a food handling operation, that

additional licensing fee equivalent to the cost of the health inspections
conducted by Cook County on the premises during the year.



(MC-825, § 1, 2-9-10; MC-914, § 1, 10-28-14; MC-926, § 1, 6-9-15)

permit. Any such hearing shall be held as soon as possible and shall be
conducted at a time and place designated by the village manager except that

official notice or order considered in the hearing. A written report of the
hearing decision shall be furnished to the licensee or permit holder within

Section 625 of the Cable Act of 1984, as amended from time to time.



      (2)   The Grantee may apply to the Village for a modification
of the requirements in a franchise, on a condition other than the
demonstration of commercial impracticability. The Village may consider said
request for modification if the Grantee can demonstrate that the modification
would enable the Grantee to provide service in a more efficient, effective,
or economical manner to the subscribers and the Village;  and the Village
may grant said modification.  Nothing in this provision shall require the
Village to modify the franchise agreement.



      (3)   The Grantor may, with good cause, request that the
Grantee modify the franchise agreement whenever the Village concludes that
such modification  will result in subscribers and/or  Grantor being served
in a more efficient, effective, or economical manner by the Grantee.  Upon
notice  to the Grantee  and the opportunity to confer, Grantor may adopt 
reasonable modifications of the Grantee's franchise relating solely to
matters of health, safety or welfare.



      (4)   Notwithstanding Section C of this Chapter, the Grantor
may modify this Chapter under its police powers in accordance with the
authority granted under Illinois and federal law.



   (b)   Costs and fees of modification process:  Unless otherwise
stipulated in the Franchise Agreement, each party to a request for any 
modification of the franchise agreement shall be responsible for all of its
costs related to the modification review or implementation process.

   (c)   Topics:  Topics discussed at any scheduled session, or
special evaluation session, may include the examination of any condition or
requirement of the franchise agreement, judicial and FCC rulings, the
Grantee's responsiveness to the community's needs and interests, and other
topics as determined by the Village. The Grantee may also suggest topics to
be discussed.



   (d)   Notice:



      (1)   All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and

   (e)   System or component testing required:



      (1)   If at any time during its review, the Village determines
that reasonable evidence exists of inadequate cable system performance, it
may require the Grantee to perform tests and analyses directed toward the
suspected inadequacies. The Grantee shall fully cooperate with the Village in
performing such testing and shall prepare results and a written report signed
by the system manager and the person conducting the testing, if requested,
within thirty (30) days after the notice to test.  Such reports shall
include the following information:

such tests as may be required herein.  The Village may reasonably require
that the tests be supervised by a technical consultant experienced in cable
television.  Should the Village determine that one or more tests be
re-administered, the Village may engage a technical consultant.



      (3)   The Village's rights under this Section shall be limited
to requiring tests, analysis, and reports covering specific subjects and
characteristics based on a substantial number of complaints or other
reasonable evidence when and under such circumstances as the Village has
reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require
the tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable
service.

Sec. 28-8.  Franchise renewal.



   (a)   Notice by grantee:  The Grantee shall be solely responsible
for providing written notice to the Village that the Grantee wishes to renew
the cable television franchise agreement not less than thirty (30) months
before the expiration of the franchise agreement.



   (b)   Review of the grantee:



      (1)   Upon receipt of the franchise renewal request, or as
otherwise determined by the Village, the Village shall conduct a review of
the Grantee's performance under the present terms and conditions of the
franchise agreement, and shall consider the future communication needs and

future term of a renewed franchise agreement.  The Village and the Grantee
shall abide by any federal or state law, that in addition to this Chapter,
governs the conduct of a cable television franchise renewal.



      (2)   The Village may require that the Grantee respond to a
RFP, or provide to the Village a proposal that sets outs the services and
technical specifications to be provided during the new franchise term.  Upon
issuance of the RFP, the Grantee shall not submit a proposal for service
prior to a date determined by the Village.  The Village may, or may not
consider a proposal submitted



by the Grantee prior to the issuance of the RFP.  Notwithstanding, prior to
the Village's issuance of a RFP, the Grantee may submit a proposal under
Section 626 paragraph H of the Cable Act along with a written notice  that
the proposal is being submitted under paragraph H  (the informal proposal).



      (3)   The Village may hear any interested persons during a
session called for the purpose of determining the renewal of the franchise
agreement, and the Village may determine whether or not the Grantee did
reasonably comply with the terms and conditions imposed by the ordinance and
current franchise agreement.



      (4)   If the Village determines that the Grantee is in
substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of the current franchise
agreement, and that the Grantee's proposal for future service meets the
community's needs and interests, the Village may renew the Grantee's
franchise agreement for a specific term.



   (c)   Compliance with terms and conditions:  The Village may
require that any substantial non-compliance issues be resolved to the
satisfaction of the Village prior to any negotiation of the renewed franchise
agreement.



   (d)   Assessment to not renew the franchise agreement:  The Village
may, upon the completion of its investigation, and upon submittal of a
proposal from the Grantee, issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise
should not be renewed.  Upon said assessment, the Village and the Grantee
shall follow the procedures in Section 626 of the Cable Act, as amended from
time to time.



   (e)   Recouping of village expenses, costs, and fees: Upon
determination of renewal, the Grantee and the Village may agree to a
discharge of expenses and costs in the franchise agreement in an exhibit
titled, AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES AND

(Code 1965, §43.08(a-e))



Sec. 28-9.  Transfer of the franchise agreement.



   (a)   Franchise as a trust and privilege: A franchise granted under
this Chapter shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by a
Grantee.  It shall not be assigned, transferred, sold, or disposed of, in
whole or in part, by voluntary sale, sale and leaseback, merger,
consolidation, exchange of stock, by provision of a management agreement, or
otherwise, or by forced or involuntary sale, without prior consent of the
Village expressed by resolution and then only on such conditions as may
herein be prescribed.  Any sale, transfer, or assignment not made according
to the procedures set forth in this Chapter shall be considered a substantial
violation. The sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of the major part of the
tangible assets of the Grantee's system  shall be considered an assignment
and shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.



   (b)   Approval of village required:



      (1)   Prior approval of the Village shall be required where
ownership, or control of more than twenty percent (20%) of the right of
control of the Grantee is acquired during the term of the franchise in any
transaction, or series of transactions, by a person or group of persons
acting in concert, none of whom owned or controlled twenty (20%) percent or
more of such right of control, singularly or collectively on the effective
date of the franchise.  By its acceptance of this franchise, the Grantee
specifically grants and agrees that any such acquisition occurring without
prior approval of the Village shall render the franchise void.  A change in
the general partner of a limited partnership, if the franchise is held by a
limited partnership, shall not be considered a transfer provided that the
general partner continues to be an affiliate, or subsidiary, or the parent
company of the Grantee; nonetheless, the Village shall still be notified of
said change of the general partner at least thirty (30) days prior to the
change.



      (2)   No such consent shall be required for a transfer in
trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part,
to secure an indebtedness except when such hypothecation shall exceed
seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value of the property used by
the Grantee in the operation of its cable television system.  Prior consent
of the Village shall be required, expressed by resolution, for such transfer
and said consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.



      (3)   A transfer of stock shall be considered a transfer of
the ownership of the company.



      (4)   Grantee shall file  with the Village as requested a
copy of its State Domestic Corporation Annual Report or equivalent as
specified in the franchise agreement.



      (5)   Transfer of ownership shall also be governed by the
Cable Act, Section 617, as amended from time to time.



   (c)   Notice:  Whenever any transfer subject to Village approval
under this Chapter is proposed, the Grantee shall provide the Village with
reasonable notice of the intent to transfer and shall provide the Village
with all information requested by the Village in its investigation of the
transfer. The Grantee shall provide to the Village complete information
setting forth the nature, terms, conditions and all other pertinent details
of such proposed transfer. The Grantee shall meet with the Village to resolve
any violations of the franchise agreement prior to the transfer. 
Furthermore, no approval of the transfer shall be granted unless all monies
accruing to the Village as of the date of the transfer, whether by way of
fees, penalties, damages or otherwise, have first been paid in full.  Upon
the full disclosure of information required by the Cable Act and by the
Village in the determination of the qualification of the transfer candidate,
the Village shall then consider the application for a transfer consistent
with the requirements of the Act.



   (d)   Information required:  The proposed buyer of the cable system
shall provide such evidence to the Village as to qualify the applicant as
being financially, technically, and legally capable.  The Village may
require financial pro forms and letters from the lending institution
verifying funding for the acquisition and operation of the cable system. 
The proposed buyer shall agree, in writing, to comply with all the terms and
conditions of the franchise agreement and Chapter.



   (e)   Surety or guaranty agreement required:



      (1)   The Village may require that a Grantee whose formation
is by partnership, be it limited or general, provide a surety or guaranty
agreement which establishes that the parent company of one, or all general
partners, accepts liability for the debt and performance of the partnership
should the partnership default.  This may also be required by the Village
for transfers to non-related buyers of the system or to transfers to a
subsidiary or affiliate company, corporation, or partnership of the current
Grantee.



      (2)   The Village may require that the transfer applicant post
a bond, or letter of credit, in addition to, or higher than that which is
specified in the original franchise agreement should the applicant's
circumstances so warrant.



   (f)   Modification and renegotiation:  The Village maintains the
right, at the time of the transfer application, to seek modifications to the
franchise agreement that the Village deems will benefit the needs and
interests of the community.



   (g)   Village rights not waived:  The consent of the Village to any
sale, transfer, lease, trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation
shall not constitute a waiver or release of any rights of the Village under
this Chapter and the franchise.



(Code 1965, §43.09(a-g))



Sec. 28-10.  Franchise forfeiture and termination.



   (a)   Conditions:



      (1)   In addition to all other rights and powers retained by
the Village under the franchise, or otherwise, the Village reserves the right
to forfeit and terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the
Grantee hereunder in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and
conditions.  A substantial breach by the Grantee shall include, but shall
not be limited to the following:



         a.   Violation of any material provision of the
franchise or any material rule, order, regulation or determination of the
Village made pursuant to the franchise; or



         b.   Attempt to evade any material provision of the
franchise or practice any fraud or material deception  upon the cable
television system subscribers or upon the Village government; or



         c.   Failure to provide the services defined in the
franchise agreement; or



         d.   Failure to begin or complete system construction or
system line extension in accordance with the terms of the franchise
agreement; or



         e.   Failure to restore system wide service after
twenty-four (24) consecutive hours of deliberately interrupted service,
except when approval of said interruption is obtained from the Village; or in
the event of a natural disaster;  or



         f.   Material misrepresentation of fact in the
application for or negotiation of, or renewal of the franchise; or



         g.   Frequent and material violations by the Grantee of
any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the
Grantee relative to its franchise; or



         h.   Repeated failure to pay the franchise fee in
accordance with Section 28-12(b) of the Chapter and in accordance with the
terms of the franchise agreement;  or



         i.   The Grantee applies to any tribunal for the
appointment of a trustee or receiver for any substantial part of the assets
of the Grantee, or commences any proceedings relating to the Grantee under
any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt, assignment
for the benefit of creditor, dissolution or other liquidation law of any
jurisdiction, or any such application is filed, or any such proceeding is
commenced, against the Grantee, and the Grantee indicates its approval,
consent or acquiescence, or an order entered appointing such trustee or
receiver or adjudicating the Grantee bankrupt or insolvent, or approving the
petition in any such proceeding, and such order remains in effect for
forty-five (45) days.



      (2)   The foregoing shall not constitute a substantial breach
if the violation occurs but it is without fault of the Grantee or occurs as a
result of circumstances beyond its direct control such as war, civil
disturbance, natural catastrophe and other acts of God, or failure of timely
receipt of licenses from utility companies.  The Grantee shall not be
excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its
directors, officers, or employees.



      (3)   The Village may make a written demand that the Grantee
comply with any such provision, rule, order, or determination under or
pursuant to this franchise.  If the violation continues for a period of
thirty (30) days, or as otherwise stipulated in the Chapter or franchise
agreement, following receipt of the written demand without written proof that
the corrective action has taken or is being actively and expeditiously
pursued, the Village may consider terminating the cable system franchise
provided that the Village shall cause to be served upon the Grantee a notice,
in accordance with Section 43.05 of the Chapter, that the Village is to
consider the issue of termination, a written notice of intent to request
termination and the time and place of the meeting.



      (4)   The Village Board, or its duly designated representative
shall hear and consider the issue and shall hear any person interested
therein, and the Village Board shall determine in its discretion whether or
not any violation by the Grantee occurred.



      (5)   If the Village Board shall determine the violation by
the Grantee was the fault of the Grantee and within its control, the Board
may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the Grantee shall be
forfeited and terminated unless there is compliance within such period as the
Board may fix, such period shall not be less than ten (10) days, provided
that no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or willful,
material misrepresentation.



      (6)   The issue of forfeiture and termination shall be
considered by the Village Board at the expiration of the time set for the
Grantee to have returned to compliance in accordance with paragraph 5.  The
Board may within thirty (30) days of the end of the compliance period
terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the Grantee has failed to
achieve compliance or may extend the compliance period at the Board's
discretion, or may continue its deliberations for an additional thirty (30)
day period.  The Village Board shall make known its decision to the Grantee
through a written instrument.



      (7)   The Board may establish a set time by which the Grantee
shall remove, or abandon all, or a portion of, the tangible assets of its
system from the Village's right-of-ways and from subscriber's homes or may
direct the Grantee to sell the cable system at the fair market value with no
value allocated to the franchise itself.  If the Village revokes the
franchise for cause and seeks to acquire ownership of the cable system, or
effects to transfer the ownership of the system to another person, it shall
do so at an equitable price.



   (b)   Removal of cable plant:  The Grantee shall apply for and
obtain such encroachment permits, licenses, authorizations or approvals and
pay such fees and deposit such security as required by the applicable
Chapters of the Village or by state statute, or as required by the Village
Board, shall conduct and complete the removal in compliance with all such
applicable ordinances, and shall restore the streets to the same condition as
prior to the work of the removal commenced.  The work of removal shall be
completed not later than one year following the date of expiration or
termination of the franchise, unless some other date has been set by the
Village Board in its notice to the Grantee;  otherwise the Village may
complete such work through and by its employees or through a contractor(s)
selected by the Village and charge the expense thereof against the security
deposit, letter of credit, and/or construction bond required to be provided
by the Grantee.



   (c)   Additional rights of the village:  The termination or
forfeiture of the Grantee's rights under a franchise shall in no way affect
any other rights the Village may have under the franchise or under any
provision of law.



(Code 1965, §43.10(a-c))



Sec. 28-11.  Continuation of service.



   (a)   Provision of service:



      (1)   For a reasonable time, in the period between expiration,
cancellation, revocation, or termination of the franchise and the transfer of
the cable system pursuant to the Chapter, the Grantee shall continue to
provide operations service and customer service to the public as if the
franchise were still in effect.



      (2)   The Grantee shall act as a trustee for its successor in
the interest of the cable franchise and provide a financial accounting during
the interim period. The Grantee shall hold the franchise as a trustee for the
successor and shall not sell or otherwise dispose of any of the systems'
assets nor shall the Grantee make any physical, administrative, or
operational changes that, without the express written consent of the Village,
would tend to:



         a.   Degrade the quality of the service to subscribers,



         b.   Decrease gross revenues, or



         c.   Materially increase expenses.



      (3)   In the event the Grantee fails or refuses to operate the
system in accordance with the terms of the Chapter and franchise agreement,
the Village shall have the option to institute legal proceedings to name a
successor trustee to operate the system.



   (b)   Authority to continue to operate the cable system:



      (1)   In the event of expiration or revocation of the
franchise agreement, this Section shall not be construed to give the Grantee
any vested right, or authority of franchise.  The right of the Grantee under
such circumstances shall exist only on a day-to-day basis until the transfer
or sale is effected.



      (2)   As full compensation for its ownership interests during
this interim period, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive a reasonable
profit during the period between the expiration or revocation of the
franchise, as the case may be, and the transfer of the Grantee's assets to
the Village or a successor.



      (3)   The Grantee shall be liable for all the costs of
operating and maintaining the system in the event that the Village must
assume the day to day operation of the cable system.  In addition, the
Village, or its representative, shall place the profit, if any, from the
operation of the system during this period in an interest bearing account
until such time as all proceedings against the Grantee have been adjudicated.



(Code 1965, §43.11(a,b))



Sec. 28-12.  Franchise fee.



   (a)   Provision of a franchise fee:



      (1)   As compensation for the franchise granted herein, the
Grantee shall pay to the Village a  franchise fee in an annual amount of
five (5%) percent of Gross Revenues as defined in Section 28-03 and Section
28-12(c).



      (2)   To the extent permitted by law and in accordance
therewith, franchise fees in excess of five percent may be collected by the
Village after thirty (30) days written notice to the Grantee, or as otherwise
may be detailed in the franchise agreement.  The recomputed percentage will
be an automatic modification to this Chapter Section after the expiration of
the thirty day (30) notice.  Any such increase in the franchise fee shall
not be considered a rate increase by the Grantee for the purpose of
subscriber notification.



   (b)   Payment of the franchise fee:



      (1)   Franchise fees are to be paid quarterly and not later
than sixty (60)  days following the last day of the quarter.  Franchise
fees are to be mailed by certified mail, or may be hand delivered, to the
Village Treasurer's office.



      (2)   Each franchise fee payment shall be accompanied by a
financial statement, as attached as Exhibit A to the franchise agreement,
that clearly defines the subscriber count and gross revenues for the quarter
said payment is rendered. The financial statement shall be signed by the
Grantee's controller, or other employee knowledgeable as to the accuracy of
the figures used in the computation and the corresponding payment to the
Village.



      (3)   Any franchise fee which remains unpaid after the date
specified in the Chapter shall be delinquent and shall thereafter accrue
interest at the maximum rate permitted by law in the State of Illinois, until
fully paid.  The costs incurred by the Village in obtaining a judgment,
including attorney's fees and court costs, for the unpaid balance of the
franchise fees, as set forth in Section 28-12(b) of the Chapter, shall be
borne by the Grantee.



      (4)   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an
accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall such
acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the
Village may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions
of this Section.



      (5)   Upon termination of the Franchise at the expiration of
the term provided thereof, or otherwise, the Grantee shall continue to make
quarterly statements and certifications and annual reports as provided in
this Section until such time as all payments due the Village under this
Chapter have been paid and accounted for to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Village.



   (c)   Gross revenue calculations:



      (1)   For purposes of the Gross Revenue calculation, the
phrase "financial interest" as used in this Chapter shall include but not be
limited to:



         a.   Any contract in which the Grantee is to receive a
percentage of the revenues and/or a percentage of the net income of the other
party to the transaction by reason of the activities encompassed by said
contract;



         b.   Any debt relationship in which the Grantee as
debtor borrows funds at a rate more advantageous than that generally
available to similarly situated entities of similar credit worthiness;



         c.   Any debt relationship in which the Grantee as
creditor receives a rate of interest exceeding that which would otherwise be
paid by a similarly situated debtor of similar credit worthiness;



         d.   Any option or warrant to purchase the stock or
other equity interest in an entity, or in an entity related to an entity,
which generates revenues arising from or attributable to the operation of the
System;



         e.   Any debt relationship which has conversion
privileges to a form of equity of the nature described in the preceding
paragraph.



      (2)   For purposes of the Gross Revenue calculation, the
phrase "arising from or attributable to operation of the System" as used in
this Chapter shall include but not be limited to:



         a.   Any activity, product or service which generates
revenue of any type whatsoever and which is offered to the subscribers of the
System by means of the System or any related service;



         b.   Any activity, product or service in the production
or provision of which any of  the assets of the System including but not
limited to cable, production facilities, and administrative facilities, are

   (d)   Audit requirements/financial reviews:



      (1)   The Grantee shall file with the Village an annual 
statement and the parent audited report within one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the closing of the Grantee's books. The audited report shall be
prepared by a Certified Public Accountant and shall clearly show the yearly
total gross revenues by category and accumulated total and the number of
subscribers upon which the franchise fee was based.  In the event that the
Grantee's fiscal year is other than the calendar year, the Grantee shall

   (a)   Universal rates:



      (1)   Rates for all subscribers of basic cable service shall
be uniform throughout the Franchise Area. The Grantee may offer bulk billing
discounts for cable television programming services.  The Grantee shall not,
with regard to fees and rates, discriminate or grant any preference or
advantage to any person; provided, however, that the Grantee may establish
different rates for different classes of subscribers or users based upon cost
of service differentials; provided that the Grantee not discriminate between
any subscribers or users of the same class. Grantee is not prohibited from
offering discounted rates to senior citizens or economically disadvantaged
subscribers.



      (2)   To the extent consistent with law,  the Grantee may

nondiscriminatory manner for a reasonable period of time as each segment of
the cable system is activated; or during limited promotion (marketing)
periods.



      (3)   No Grantee shall enter into any agreement with a
subscriber which imposes any charge following disconnection of all services.
Grantee may charge for reconnection and subsequent monthly, or periodic
charges, and those charges shall be no greater than charges for new
customers.  This Section shall not prevent a Grantee from refusing service
to any person because Grantee's prior accounts with that person remain due

which requires more than three (3) months advance payment.

television service.

non-ambulatory, visually impaired, or hearing impaired persons that allow
them to receive the cable television service  including such devices as, but
not limited to, remote controls, closed captioned decoders, Braille reading
materials and Braille channel identification devices, shall be no more than
the actual cost of the device; In any event, the rental fee for the device
shall be no more than the same, or similar device, offered to the general
cable subscriber. The Grantee shall offer the non-ambulatory, visually
impaired, or hearing impaired subscriber the option of buying the device at
the Grantee's cost, including any allowable profit, plus the actual cost of
delivery to the subscriber.

expressly  exercises the right:



         a.   To approve the rates which the Grantee charges its
subscribers for basic service and the rates for such other services as
Village may hereafter be permitted to regulate by law.  The Grantee shall
not deny, delay, interrupt or terminate cable communications facilities to
subscribers or users because Village denies a request for a rate increase,
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to limit the
Grantee's right to seek judicial review of such action.



         b.   To require that no rate, fee or charge of any kind
shall be charged or collected from subscribers by the Grantee for basic
service or other municipally regulated services without the  authorization
of the Village.  Violation of this Section shall subject the Grantee to the
provisions of Sections 28-22 and 28-23, and shall be deemed to be a material
breach of any Franchise Agreement and shall subject the Grantee to all
remedies and penalties prescribed therein and herein and to all other
remedies, legal and equitable, which are available to the Village.



         c.   To require that the Grantee annually file with the
Village a full schedule of all subscriber and user rates and all other
charges including, but not limited to, pay TV, leased channel and discrete
services, made in connection with the cable communications system.  Said
rate schedules shall be amended whenever such rates change.



            (i)   All rates shall be published and on file
with the Village.



            (ii)   The Grantee shall not discriminate in the
assessment, levy, charge, imposition or collection of rates on the basis of
age, race, creed, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status.
The rate structure shall be uniform throughout the  franchise territory in
which cable service is provided over the system.

         e.   To allow the Grantee to require all subscribers to
pay for basic service not more than two (2) months in advance. The Grantee

increase.

the collection of the deposit or change or it  shall refund such deposit or
change within five (5) days thereafter.



               (a)   Nothing in this section shall be
construed to relieve the Grantee of any responsibility to subscribers or
users under any contractual agreements into which it enters with them.



               (b)   Nothing in this section shall be
construed as limiting the Grantee's liability for fines or penalties which
may be imposed under this Chapter or any agreement awarded in accordance
herewith for violation or breach of any of their provisions.



               (c)   Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the Grantee's liability for damages because of its failure
to provide the service for which the deposit or charge was made.



            (ii)   In the event that a subscriber terminates
basic service during the first twelve (12) months of service because of the
failure of the Grantee to render the service in accordance with the
requirement set forth in this Chapter or in any agreement awarded in
accordance herewith, the Grantee shall refund to such subscriber an amount
equal to the initial applicable installation or reconnection charge paid by
the subscriber.



               (a)   In the event that such subscriber has
made an advance payment the amount so advanced shall be refunded to such
subscriber by the Grantee.  Nothing in this provision shall be construed to
relieve the Grantee of any liability established under any other provision of
this Chapter or any agreement awarding a Franchise in accordance herewith.



            (iii)   In the event that a subscriber terminates
basic service prior to the end of a pre-paid period, the pro-rata portion of

no longer to be rendered shall be refunded promptly, but in no case more than
sixty (60) days after receipt of the request for termination.



            (i)   To require that the Grantee not charge a
converter security deposit greater than such converter's actual cost to the
Grantee.



            (i)   Any converter security deposit collected by
the Grantee shall be returned to the subscriber twenty-four (24) months after
the installation of such converter, or upon termination of service by the
subscriber and return of such converter undamaged with allowance for
reasonable wear and tear and payment of any outstanding balance due and
payable, whichever occurs first.



      (2)   Whenever Grantee requests a rate increase pursuant to
Section 28-14(c)(1), the Village shall have thirty (30) days from the date
such rate increase is requested to either approve said increase, or to toll
the review for an additional  90 days or  120 days or other such period as
provided under Federal Communications Commission rules.  If no action is
taken within the thirty (30) day period or the tolled period, the increase
shall be deemed to have been approved.  If the Village tolls the request for
further review, the proposed rate increase shall be suspended during the
review period, but in no event shall such proposed increase be suspended
longer than the maximum permitted under the 1992 Act and Federal
Communications Commission rules.  Grantee shall have all further legal
remedies available to it by law should the Village deny the proposed rate
increase or approve only a partial rate increase.



   (d)   Collection of user taxes and fees by the grantee:  To the
extent permitted by law, upon request of the Village, the Grantee shall list
on the billing statement, and collect for the Village, any tax or user fee

   (c)   Alternative provision of access facilities and services:



      (1)   In lieu of providing some, or all, of the access

in the franchise agreement for the Village to apply towards the provision of
access service and facilities.



      (2)   In the event that there is more than one franchise area,
or more than one cable operator within the corporate limits, all franchisees
shall contribute in an equitable manner through construction, provision of
equipment, cooperative training efforts, or monetary funds for the provision
of access facilities and services, rather than cause a duplication of
facilities which the Village may deem to be unnecessary.



   (d)   Training of users:  Grantee shall provide the initial
training of users of the access channels and facilities.  Additional staff
support may be provided for in the franchise agreement.

agreement, the franchise area shall be the current and future corporate
boundaries of the Village.  Service shall be extended to one hundred percent
(100%) of the dwelling and commercial units within twelve (12) months of the
effective date of the franchise granted hereunder, unless an exception to the
100 percent extension of service is granted in the franchise agreement.



      (2)   For the purpose of renewal, Grantee shall confirm that
it has extended service as required hereunder or by its franchise agreement
before  expiration of the current franchise.



   (b)   Line extensions to new development areas or annexed territory:
Grantee shall extend the system and make service available in new development
areas within the Village or such areas newly annexed to the Village. Grantee
shall design, construct and operate the system in newly annexed areas of the
Village, or in newly established subdivisions, or platted units, whichever
first occurs, provided that Grantee shall not be required to service a new
residential subdivision until such time as fifty (50%) percent of the homes
per linear mile in such subdivision, or in any platted unit of the
subdivision, have been occupied;  or within twelve (12) months of the first
occupation in that subdivision or platted unit. Grantee shall extend service
to newly annexed or constructed areas upon recognition that said area exists
or within ninety (90) days of written notification from the Village.



   (c)   Waiver of line extension:  Grantee may seek a waiver of line
extension to commercial business units located in isolated locations, if the
Grantee can establish that the provision of said service would be financially
burdensome. The Village will not unreasonably deny said waiver.



   (d)   Delays in construction:  If Grantee is delayed at any time in
the progress of construction or the furnishing of cable service to any
dwelling unit, commercial business unit, or government building or school, by
labor disputes, weather conditions precluding construction activity, any
unreasonable delays caused solely by the Village, reasonable disputes with
utility companies, or other causes beyond the Grantee's control, the time
elements set forth in Section 19 and/or in the franchise agreement shall be
extended provided that:



      (1)   Grantee notifies the Village in writing no more than
seven (7) days after the occurrence of the delay;



      (2)   The Village acknowledges to Grantee that such delay is
considered beyond the control of the Grantee; and



      (3)   The Grantee and the Village mutually agree upon a time
for the completion of the construction or activation of service.



   Any delay beyond the terms of the time line for extending cable service
as stated in this Chapter or in the franchise granted hereunder, shall
constitute a violation of this Chapter for which the  penalties stated in 
this code, and/or liquidated damages in the franchise granted hereunder may
apply, as determined by the Village.



(Code 1965, §43.20(a-d))

Sec. 28-22.  Notice to comply.



   (a)   Unless otherwise stated in the Chapter or franchise agreement,
the Grantee shall return to compliance with the Chapter and franchise
agreement after notification by the Village, or upon Grantee's own discovery:



      (1)   For consumer service and protection violations, within
forty-eight (48) hours;



      (2)   For technical and maintenance provisions, within
forty-eight (48) hours;



      (3)   For the reporting and filing of documents, within ten
(10)  business days; and



      (4)   All other provisions within a reasonable time frame as
determined by the Village, but in no event more than thirty days after
delivery of notice.



   (b)   The Village may notify the Grantee of an alleged franchise
violation, or a subscriber complaint, through a letter to a management person
identified by the Grantee who shall have the authority to accept and respond
to said communication.



   (c)   For those actions by the Grantee that the Village deems to be
of a serious or repetitive nature, the Village shall, through its agent,
notify the Grantee in writing of non-compliance.  The Village shall state
the action of non-compliance;  shall reference the Chapter and Franchise
Agreement Sections and shall provide a time frame for Grantee to comply, and
shall notify the Grantee of the action which may be taken by the Village for
Grantee's failure to comply with the terms of the franchise or Chapter.



      (1)   Grantee shall come into compliance at the request of the
Village, or



      (2)   Propose an alternative remedy which shall cure the
Municipal Code or Franchise violation and which the Village may deem
acceptable as returning the Grantee to compliance.



      (3)   Grantee may, within ten (10) days of receipt of the
notice of non-compliance from the Village, file a written request with the
Village Manager for a review of the Village Agent's determination.



         a.   The Village Manager shall review the decision of
the Village's Agent.



         b.   The Village Manager shall have the authority to
establish such rules as the franchise authority deems necessary and
appropriate relative to the conduct of his review.  The Village shall fix a
reasonable time for that review.  During the hearing before the Village
Manager, any party may appear in person, by agent or attorney.  The Village
Manager may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Village Agent.  The Village
Manager may also recommend to the Village Board that liquidated damages in a
specific amount be assessed against Grantee.  The decision of the Village
Manager shall be binding upon Grantee unless appealed to the Village Board,
or unless the Village Manager recommends the imposition of liquidated
damages, in which case, the entire matter, including the recommendation for
liquidated damages, shall be referred to the Village Board for review.  The
Village Manager's written decision in each case shall be dispatched to the
Grantee by Certified Mail, postage prepaid, or may be hand delivered by
messenger or other Village Agent.  Any recommendation for liquidated damages
shall identify the basis for that recommendation.



         c.   A review by the Village Board stays all proceedings
in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Village Manager
determines as a result of the hearing conducted by him that a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property, or would materially degrade the
quality of cable service within the Village.



         d.   A Grantee desiring a hearing before the Village
Board shall send a written notice of appeal by Certified Mail to the Village
within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the Village Manager's written
decision.  The notice of appeal shall contain a brief statement of Grantee's
basis for appeal.  The Village Board shall hold its review within a
reasonable time of the Grantee's request, but in no case more than sixty (60)
days from the date the village receives that request.  The Village Board
shall make findings of fact and a written decision within fourteen (14) days
of completion of the hearing.  The decision of the Village Board shall be
final and binding upon Grantee.  Should the Village Board approve the
imposition of liquidated damages, unless the Village Board indicates to the
contrary, such liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with the date
of the Village Manager's initial recommendation to assess such damages and
shall continue thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as
determined by the Village.



   (d)   No provision of this Chapter or of the franchise agreement
shall be deemed to bar the right of the Village, or the Grantee, to seek or
obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of the Chapter or
Franchise Agreement, or any rule, regulation, requirement, or directive
promulgated thereunder.  Neither the existence of other remedies identified
in this Chapter, or the franchise agreement, nor exercise thereof shall be
deemed to bar, or otherwise limit, the right of the Village to recover
monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed)
for such violation by the Grantee, or judicial enforcement of the Grantee's
obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate,
or any other judicial remedy available at law or in equity.



   (e)   Subject to the provisions of the Act, a Grantee shall not be
relived of any obligation to comply with any of the provisions of the
Franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated
thereunder by reason of any failure of the Village, or its officers, agents,
or employees to enforce prompt compliance, nor shall such be considered a
waiver thereof.(Code 1965, §43.22(a-e))



Sec. 28-23.  Liquidated damages.



   By acceptance of the Franchise each Grantee understands and  agrees
that failure to comply with any time and performance requirements as
stipulated in this  Chapter and the Franchise Agreement will result in
damage to the Village, and that it may be impracticable to determine the
actual amount of such damage in the event of delay or non performance;
therefore, the applicable Franchise Agreement shall include provisions for
liquidated damages to be paid by the Grantee, in amounts set forth in the
applicable Franchise Agreement and chargeable to a Security Fund hereby
created, in an amount to be determined in accordance with the applicable
Franchise Agreement.



(Code 1965, §43.23)



Sec. 28-24.  General conditions.

as otherwise set forth herein.  Said authorization shall be obtained not
less than annually.

phrase, or portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid or
unconstitutional by any federal or state court, or administrative  or
governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to
the FCC, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent
provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this Chapter, which shall be applied and construed as reasonably
as possible in the absence of the invalidated provision.



   (e)   Equal opportunity employer:  The Grantee hereby agrees that
it will not refuse to hire or employ, nor will it bar or discharge from
employment, nor discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment because of age, race, creed, color,
national origin, disability, or sex and will comply with the Act's
requirements for employment and provisions of Illinois law.



   (f)   Localism:  Whenever practicable, the Grantee shall use its

system.  Whenever practicable, the Grantee shall  exercise its  best
effort to buy goods and secure services from Village businesses. In addition,
the Grantee shall use its best efforts to hire persons locally for
construction, installation, maintenance, and repair of system equipment (P.A.
87-0377).



   (g)   Legal rights preserved:  No provision of this  Chapter shall
be deemed to bar the right of the Village to seek or obtain judicial relief
from a violation of any provision of the Franchise or any rule, regulation,
requirement or directive promulgated thereunder.  Neither the existence of
other remedies identified in this  Chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be
deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the Village to recover monetary
damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such
violation by the Grantee, or judicial enforcement of the Grantee's
obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate,
or any other judicial remedy available at law or in equity.



   (h)   Non-enforcement:  Subject to the provisions of the Cable Act,
a Grantee shall not be relieved of any obligation to comply with any of the
provisions of this Chapter, the Franchise Agreement or any rule, regulation,
requirement or directive promulgated thereunder by reason of any failure of
the Village or its officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt compliance
nor shall such be considered a waiver thereof.



   (i)   Time is of the essence:  Whenever this Chapter or the
franchise agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by,
or on behalf of the Grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any
failure within control of the Grantee to perform within the time allotted
shall be sufficient grounds for the Village to invoke an appropriate remedy
or penalty, including possible revocation of the franchise agreement.

Commission shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each
member upon every question, or if absent, or failing to vote, indicating that
fact.  All testimony before the Ethics Commission must be given under
oath.  All meetings of the Ethics Commission shall comply with the Open

39-19.   Complaints Alleging an Ethics Violation.



   All complaints shall be in writing, signed by the complainant and
addressed to the Village Ethics Commission.  Ethics complaints and responses
may be filed with the office of the Village Clerk or with the Commission
during a meeting of the Commission. Whenever the Ethics Commission receives a
complaint alleging an ethics violation it shall adhere to the following
procedure:



   a)   Upon at least twenty-four (24) hours public notice, the
Commission shall meet in closed session with the complainant to determine the
sufficiency of the complaint, and if the complaint is deemed to sufficiently
allege an ethics violation, to determine if there is probable cause, based on
evidence presented by the complainant, to proceed.  If the Commission
determines that the complaint does not contain a sufficient alleged ethics
violation, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint and send a notice of
dismissal to the complainant and,  at the discretion of the Commission, the
respondent.



   b)   If the Commission determines that the complaint sufficiently
alleges an ethics violation and there is a determination of probable cause ,
a copy of the complaint shall be mailed by registered or certified mail or
hand delivered to the respondent and the respondent shall be directed to file
a written response with the Ethics Commission within seven business days
after receipt of the complaint.  However, if the complainant is a Village
employee, the name of the complainant and a copy of the complaint shall not
be sent to the respondent unless, in the judgment of the Ethics Commission,
that information is necessary to allow the respondent to fully respond to the
complaint.  In all such cases, where a copy of the complaint is not mailed
to the party complained of, the Ethics Commission shall prepare and mail, by
registered or certified mail, or hand deliver to the respondent, a summary of
the complaint and request a written response to the Ethics Commission within
seven business days from receipt of that summary.



   c)   Unless the complaint is dismissed at this first meeting, the
Ethics Commission shall meet again in connection with the complaint within
fourteen days after a response has been received from the respondent or
within fourteen days after the mailing to respondent whichever first occurs.
The complainant shall be given written notice of the time and place of that
second meeting.



   d)   Upon at least 24-hour (24) hours public notice, the Commission
shall meet in closed session to further evaluate the complaint.  At that
second meeting the Ethics Commission may hear testimony from the complainant,
respondent, and/or any other person deemed appropriate by the Ethics
Commission in order to evaluate the complaint.  At the conclusion of the
meeting, the Ethics Commission shall either refer the matter to the
appropriate Village authority, set a time and place for formal hearing before
the Ethics Commission, dismiss the complaint or take other action as it deems
appropriate.



   e)   A complaint alleging an ethics violation must be filed within
one year of the date of the alleged violation.



39-20.   Hearings.



   The Ethics Commission shall have the authority to conduct public
hearings in connection with any matter referred to it or filed with it, if a
majority of the appointed members of the Ethics Commission vote to do so. 
At any such hearing, testimony shall be taken under oath, and a transcript of
the hearing shall be made.  At the conclusion of any such hearing, a vote
shall be taken as to what recommendations shall be made as a result of the
hearing.  The Ethics Commission shall, after every such hearing, submit
findings of fact with its recommendations to the appropriate authority



39-21.   Minutes.

ethics law.  The Ethics Advisor shall perform such other duties as may be
delegated by the Village.

for a period of not more than 364 days, and may be fined in an amount not to
exceed $2,500.



   (b)   A person who intentionally violates any provision of Section
39-10 or Section 39-12 of this Chapter is subject to a fine in an amount of

   (c)   Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleginga

beyond a reasonable doubt.A violation of Section 39-10 or Section 39-12 of

   (e)   The Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine of up to
$5000 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous, or bad
faith allegation.

whether criminal or civil, an officer or employee who intentionally violates
any provision of Section 39-9, Section 39-10 or Section 39-12 of this Chapter
is subject to discipline or discharge.



39.24   Where to Report Improper Behavior.



   Village employees and members of Village boards, commissions,
committees and the Village Board have a duty to prevent any improper
governmental actions. Hence, there is no shame in being a “whistleblower”
if another employee or appointed or elected officer is acting improperly.
Village employees and officials should never attempt to use their authority
or influence for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing,
commanding, or influencing any person with the intent of interfering with
that person’s duty to disclose such improper activity. Any employee, member
of a Village board, commission, committee or any member of the Village Board
can report, confidentially if desired, any observed problem or wrongdoing to
the Ethics Commission, the Village Manager or the Village Attorney.

village by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8, 5/11-31-2. The
purpose of this article is to maintain this village's eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to
periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic
and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This article is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes:



      (1)   Meet the requirements of section 18g. of the Rivers,
Lakes and Streams Act (615 ILCS 5/18g.).



      (2)   Protect human life and health from the hazards of
flooding.



      (3)   Protect new buildings and major improvements to
buildings from flood damage.



      (4)   Ensure that new development does not increase flood or
drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion.



      (5)   Lessen the burden on taxpayers for flood control
projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood
rescue and relief operations.



      (6)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
property in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.



      (7)   Comply with the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended.



      (8)   Protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development
of land and water resources.



      (9)   Preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions
of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic
habitats.



      (10)   Preserve the natural characteristics of stream
corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, prevent
deteriorated water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian
habitat, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.



      (11)   Prevent the adverse impacts resulting from increases in
stormwater runoff quantity, or rate and decreases in quality caused by the
development and improvement of land.

   (d)   Upon receipt of a site permit application for a project
located wholly or part within a flood fringe, the director shall compare the
elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation. If the director determines that the existing elevation has not
been increased over the natural grade as it appeared when the parcel was
first identified on a FIRM map as being in a floodplain; and if the existing
elevation is above the base flood elevation, then the site is not located in
a SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements applicable
specifically to special flood hazard areas. The director shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first flood insurance rate map identification.



   (e)   The applicant shall be required to furnish to the director
copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letter; that may be required for this type of activity.

DIVISION 3. FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION



Sec. 46-111. Duties of the director; administration and enforcement.



The director shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this article and shall cause all necessary surveys, studies,
inspections and reviews to take place. The director’s duties shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:



      (1)   Ensure that all development activities within the
jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this article and are
permitted.



      (2)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon
request about permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques.



      (3)   Check all new development sites to determine whether
they are in a special flood hazard area. If they are in a SFHA, determine
whether they are in a floodway, floodfringe or a floodplain which drains more
than one square mile on which a detailed study has not been conducted.



      (4)   If the development activity includes construction of a
weir, dam, restrictive culverts or impoundment berms for the purpose of
storing or diverting or creating a pool of water, ensure that a state
department of transportation, division of water resources has issued a dam
safety permit or a letter indicating a dam safety permit is not required.



      (5)   Inspect all development projects to ensure they comply
with the provisions of this article.



      (6)   For all buildings within floodplain areas, maintain a
record of the elevation certificate of the lowest floor, including the
basement, or the elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate.



      (7)   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request
base flood data, SFHA and regulatory floodway maps, copies of federal or
state permit documents, documentation of variances, conditional letter of map
revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and as-built
elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed subject to
this article.



      (8)   Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by the division for all development projects within floodplains unless
enforcement responsibilities for those areas has been delegated to the
village.



      (9)   In accordance with 92 Ill. Adm. Chapter 708 for
construction in the regulatory floodway, the director shall, without
exception, forward permit applications and all supporting documents to the
division for review and action in the following instances:



         a.   When work is proposed by organizations exempt from
this article.



         b.   Projects involving dams or impoundment structures
and all state, federal or local units of government projects, including
projects of this village.



         c.   Any activity which would result in a change in the
base flood elevation or location of floodway.



         d.   Review of an engineer's determination that an
existing bridge or culvert is not a source of flood damage.



         e.   Review of an engineer's determination that a
proposed bridge affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream may
be built with a smaller opening.



         f.   Proposals for alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as required in this division.



      (10)   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management
agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data
and to improve the administration of this article. Submit data to the
division and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for proposed revisions
of a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the National Flood
Insurance Program. Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of any
proposed amendments to this article.



(Code 1965, § 40.301)



Sec. 46-112. Improvements within flood fringes.



   (a)   Development in and filling of the flood fringe will only be
permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood by proper elevation and compensatory storage and other
provisions of this article are met.



   (b)   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for an
approvable development is allowed. The construction and maintenance of roads
necessary for permitted uses are allowed only on a limited basis and where no
alternate location outside of the floodplain is available.



   (c)   Land surface modification within the flood fringe shall be
permitted for the purpose of constructing stormwater drainage swales between
the developed area of a lot, including a stormwater detention facility on a
lot, and a stream, or detention facility.



   (d)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use,
the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or
structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be
compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of
excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.1 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams
and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the
areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing
ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.



(Code 1965, § 40.302)



Sec. 46-113. Allowable uses in floodways.



   It shall be unlawful for any person to cause, create or maintain any
improvements within a floodway, or watercourse of any type, except those
classified in this section as appropriate uses or otherwise authorized by
this article. The only developments in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health, safety
and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the
floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat
during or after the development activity. Only those appropriate uses listed
in this section will be allowed:



      (1)   Public flood control structures, dikes, dams and other
public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage,
flooding of existing structures, erosion, or water quality or habitat for
fish and wildlife.



      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or
requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment
facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating
and other functionally water dependent uses.



      (3)   Storm sewer outfalls.



      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities.



      (5)   Public open space and recreational facilities such as
playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50
percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the
direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions.



      (6)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, walkways, railways and any
modification thereto, which are used for crossing a floodway.



      (7)   Floodproofing activities to protect existing structures
including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures,
or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial
principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more
than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and
which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure.



      (8)   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings,
reconstruction or repairs made to a building that is valued at less than 50
percent of the market value of the building before it was damaged or
replaced, and which does not increase the outside dimensions of the building.



   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, detention or retention facilities, building additions,
buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done for the
convenience of site design, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence), and storage of materials.



(Code 1965, § 40.303)



Sec. 46-114. Setback and buffer strip requirements.



   (a)   For those areas adjacent to streams where a floodway has been
defined, it shall be unlawful for any person to cause or create any buildings
or impervious surfaces whose area exceeds ten percent of the area within a
minimum distance of 75 feet of the ordinary high-water mark. This section
applies to channels that have been modified in accordance with section
46-119(9). Only appropriate uses may be permitted within any floodway within
the setback area in accordance with section 46-113. For any development that
occurred after July 13, 1993, a vegetated buffer strip shall be preserved
within the setback area extending landward a minimum of 25 feet from the
ordinary high-water mark. The buffer strip shall be continuous and natural in
appearance except in limited areas to accommodate appropriate uses (such as
trails) and maintenance activities. Within the vegetated buffer strip, trees,
shrubs and tall herbaceous plants may be selectively pruned to achieve a
filtered view from the principal structure and for reasonable access. Such
pruning and removal activities shall ensure that a live root system stays
intact to provide for bank stabilization and erosion control. The
requirements of this subsection are optional, but strongly encouraged for
areas that have been previously developed.



   (b)   Where it is impossible to protect a buffer strip during
construction involving an appropriate use or where a stream channel has been
modified in accordance with the requirements of section 46-119(9), a
vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction.
A landscape plan which provides for restoration of  native vegetation and
habitat is strongly encouraged. Nonnative plants on an approved list
maintained by the director may be substituted for native species.



(Code 1965, § 40.304)



Sec. 46-115. Variances from article.



   (a)   Granting variances is not consistent with the purpose of this
article, and it is therefore essential that every effort be made to comply
with the requirements of this article. No variances shall be granted for any
development located in a regulatory floodway. However, when a development
proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway, and the applicant
believes that the standards of this article place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village manager
for a variance. The manager shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall prepare a recommendation and schedule a hearing on the
matter at a regular meeting of the village board of trustees. The board of
trustees, after hearing the request, shall rule on the request for a variance.



   (b)   No variance shall be granted by the village board for
development in a flood fringe unless the applicant demonstrates that:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
SFHA.



      (2)   An undue hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.



      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.



      (4)   The development will not create a nuisance, or create or
increase a threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses and
functions, especially aquatic habitat.



      (5)   The development will not cause or result in additional
public expense for flood protection, lost environmental stream uses and
functions, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to stream beds
and banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities.



      (6)   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway.



      (7)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not
represent a general problem.



      (8)   The granting of the variance will not alter the
essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses.



   (c)   Upon receipt of any application for a variance, the director
shall notify the applicant in writing that a variance from requirements of
this division that would lessen the degree of protection to a building may:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance;



      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of
the risk and liability.



   Upon receipt of written acknowledgement from the applicant of this
notice, the variance application shall be processed in accordance with this
section.



   (d)   The director may require an independent study and report by a
qualified professional engineer, the cost of which shall be paid by the
applicant for the variance. The purpose of the study shall be to provide
evaluations of the applicant's proposed improvements as they may affect
stream flows and hydraulic characteristics of the watercourse and to also
evaluate possible alternatives to the applicant's proposal.



   (e)   Variances from the building protection requirements of this
article requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration
of a site or building included on the National Register of Historic Places or
the state register of historic places may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements for other buildings.



(Code 1965, § 40.305)



Sec. 46-116. Disclaimer of liability.



   The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
article does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
special flood hazard area will be free from flooding or damage. This article
shall not create liability on the part of the village or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
article or any administrative decision made lawfully under this article.



(Code 1965, § 40.306)



Sec. 46-117.  Base flood elevation.



   (a)   The protection standards of this article are based on the
flood insurance study for the village. If a base flood elevation for 100-year
frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the
protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in
the state water survey's floodplain information repository. When a party
disagrees with the best available data, he may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit
it to the division and FEMA.



   (b)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHAs of Butterfield Creek and Cherry Creek shall be delineated on the
100-year profiles in the countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 19,
2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time
to time.



   (c)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the
SFHAs of those parts or unincorporated Cook County that are within the one
and half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction or that may be annexed into the
village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and dated November 6, 2000, and such amendments
to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.



   (e)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
SFHA delineated as an AH zone or AO zone shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the village.



   (f)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each
of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A zone on the flood insurance rate
map of the village shall be according to the best existing data available in
the state water survey floodplain information repository. When no base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a
backwater model such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The
flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic
model, such as HEC-I TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various
publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating
peak flood discharges. Flood flows will be based on anticipated future land
use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional
land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile,
the above analyses shall be submitted to the division for approval. Once
approved, it must be submitted to the state water survey floodplain
information repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood
elevation shall be the historic flood of record, plus three feet, unless
calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the state water
survey.



(Code 1965, § 40.307)  (MC-805, § 1, 7-22-08)



Sec. 46-118.  Occupation and use of flood fringe areas.



   (a)   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to
public health and safety.



   (b)   If fill is proposed to elevate the site above the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the purpose of removing the site
from the floodplain, prior to issuance of a use permit, the developer shall
submit sufficient data to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to revise
the regulatory flood data.



   (c)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use,
the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or
structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be
compensated for by at least 1.1 times the hydraulically equivalent volume of
excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain
storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation must be replaced
below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost
above the existing ten-year flood elevation must be replaced above the
proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed
to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.



(Code 1965, § 40.308)



Sec. 46-119.  Preservation of identified floodways.



   Within the regulatory  floodway  as identified on the regulatory
floodway maps designated by the division, the construction of an appropriate
use will be considered permissible, provided that the proposed project meets
the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing
with supporting plans, calculations, and data by an engineer, and provided
that structures meet the building protection requirements of this article:



      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to cause a
rise in the base flood elevation or increase flood stages upstream. For
appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures
or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project
will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency flood. The carrying capacity of all altered watercourses must be
maintained. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the
following factors shall be taken into consideration:



         a.   Regulatory floodway conveyance,



            K = (1.486/n)AR2/3



      where n is Manning's roughness factor, A is the effective area of
the cross section, and R is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
(See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company,
New York.)



         b.   The  same Manning's n value  shall be used for 
both existing  and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance 
agreement  with  a federal, state, or local unit of government can ensure
the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from
a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover.



         c.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to the division through engineering calculations or model tests
that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:



      1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.



      2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.



      3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.



      4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the
regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties.



      5.   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.



      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any
regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of
fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control
projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least 1.1 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created
storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be
required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall
be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed
100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the
existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be
placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer
shall demonstrate to the division through a determination of flood discharges
and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically
equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as
a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.



      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to
increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except
bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway
velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event. However in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream
structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if
scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or
other design measures.



      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and
roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages when compared to the existing conditions for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event, or the upstream
flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within
existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design
protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood
easements.



         a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages
must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood
elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in this
subsection. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic
Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using
the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways
calculation procedures.



         b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for in
accordance with this division.



         c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated in accordance
with this division.



         d.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by
the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile
must be submitted to the division for concurrence that a CLOMR is not
required.



         e.   All excavations for the construction of the
crossing shall be designed in accordance with this division.



      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges,
culverts and approach roads. Reconstruction or modification of existing
bridges, culverts and approach roads shall be effected as follows:



         a.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach
reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.



         b.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway
approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the
upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility
of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into
consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.



         c.   The determination as to whether or not the existing
crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be
prepared in accordance with the state department of transportation Rules 92
Ill. Adm. Chapter 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and
submitted to the division for review and concurrence before a permit is
issued.



      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water. Any increase in upstream flood stages, when compared to the existing
conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event, shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design
protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood
easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from the division, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or
waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures shall
meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm. Chapter 702 (Construction
and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of
the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be
demonstrated that:



         a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public
interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional
stormwater detention.



         b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning.



         c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to
degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should
include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a
presedimentation basin.



         d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented
in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well
as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other
pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed,
the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate
with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.



         e.   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of this article.



      (7)   Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and
commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside
dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the
floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the
outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not
be required for floodproofing activities.



      (8)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed
in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to
and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate
for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the division
through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions
may be used with the same efficiency:



         a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a
wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate
of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.



         b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a
narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a
rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.



         c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.



         d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland
upstream and downstream of the transition sections.



      (9)   Activities involving channel modifications. If the
proposed activity involves a channel modification, it must be demonstrated
that:



         a.   There are no practicable alternatives to the
activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural
conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include
levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of
structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or
the establishment of a streamside buffer strip or green belt. Channel
modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions
and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat.



         b.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions
would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant
habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement
of an equivalent degree of natural resource values.



         c.   The activity has been planned and designed and will
be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the
natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the
following criteria:



         1.   The physical characteristics of the modified
channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in
length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been
previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should
be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.



         2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be
provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed
such that they will prevent erosion.



         3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used,
when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited
to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and
stabilization effects of the vegetation.



         4.   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.



         5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side
slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.



         6.   All disturbed areas associated with the
modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon
completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall
be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of
the vegetative cover.



         7.   If the existing channel contains considerable
bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features,
such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting
areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be
established, where appropriate.



         8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the
downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of
downstream water quality.



         9.   New or relocated channels should be built dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.



         10.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity
as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood
unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an
increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control
project. 11.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.



         d.   The project otherwise complies with the
requirements of this division.



      (10)   Professional engineering analyses. All engineering
analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a professional
engineer.



      (11)   Permit requirements of dams. All dams and impoundment
structures shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm. Chapter 702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams).



      (12)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities
located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by
the applicant.



      (13)   Public flood control project. For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met
if the applicant can demonstrate to the division of water resources through
hydrologic and hydraulic calculations that the proposed project will not
singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the
project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event.

Sec. 46-121. Protecting buildings.



   New buildings to be located within a floodplain, or existing buildings
to be modified in a floodplain, shall be protected from flood damage below
the flood protection elevation. In addition, existing buildings located
within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate
use standards included in this division. These building protection
requirements apply to the following situations:



      (1)   Construction or placement of a new building.



      (2)   A structural alteration to an existing building that
either increases the first floor area by more than 20 percent or the
building's market value by more than 50 percent.



      (3)   Installing a manufactured home on a new or existing
site. These building protection requirements do not apply to returning a
mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to
avoid flood damage.



      (4)   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days.



(Code 1965, § 40.311)



Sec. 46-122. Protection by landfill.



   A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be
constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following:



      (1)   The lowest floor, including the basement, shall be at or
above the flood protection elevation; and



      (2)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one
foot deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection
elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation.
However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer
certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to
hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour.
The fill shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties.



(Code 1965, § 40.312)



Sec. 46-123. Protection by elevating.



   A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance
with the following:



      (1)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on
stilts, piles, walls, crawl space or other foundation that is permanently
open to floodwaters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no
more than one foot above grade, and a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.



      (2)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored
and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to
minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice
and floating debris.



      (3)   All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be
constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor,
including the basement, and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing,
and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or
above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and
telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service facilities
may be located below the flood protection elevation. Gravity, storm, and
sanitary sewer connections are specifically prohibited. Overhead sewers are
required for sanitary connections and sumps are required for the storm sewer
connections.



      (4)   No area below the flood protection elevations shall be
used for storage of items or materials.



      (5)   Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed
on a site for more than 180 days shall be elevated at or above the flood
protection elevation, and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the rules and
regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act (210 ILCS 120/1 et
seq.) issued pursuant to 77 Ill. Adm. Chapter 870.



(Code 1965, § 40.313)



Sec. 46-124. Other protective measures.



   Only a nonresidential building may be floodproofed (in lieu of
elevation), provided, however, that an engineer shall certify that the
building has been structurally floodproofed below the flood protection
elevation, and the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight
and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of
buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be
operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity.



(Code 1965, § 40.314)



Sec. 46-125. Protecting accessory structures.



   Accessory structures on an existing single-family platted lot, such as
sheds and detached garages, may be constructed with the lowest floor below
the flood protection elevation in accordance with all the following:



      (1)   The building is not used for human habitation.



      (2)   All areas below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation shall be constructed with waterproof material. Structures
located in a regulatory floodway shall be constructed and placed on a
building site so as not to block the flow of floodwaters and shall also meet
the appropriate use criteria of this division. All other requirements of this
division must be met.



      (3)   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation.



      (4)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation.

be less than 500 square feet in size.



      (6)   The building must only be used for the storage of
vehicles or tools and may not contain other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or
similar uses.



(Code 1965, § 40.315)



Sec. 46-126. Altering nonconforming structures.



   Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in
use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A
nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or
manmade disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50 percent of its
market value before it was damaged, in which case it must conform to this
article.



(Code 1965, § 40.316)



Sec. 46-127. Occupation and use of SFHA



areas where floodways are not identified.



   (a)   In SFHAs or floodplains where no floodways have been
identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been
established, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect
of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses
and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and
passage of the floodwaters, nor significantly increase the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation.



   (b)   The permitting requirements of division 2 of this article
shall apply when projects are proposed in SFHA areas where floodways are not
identified.



   (c)   No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been
determined, shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair
the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or
impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall
be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article.



   (d)   Within all riverine SFHA's where floodways have not been
determined, the developer shall have an engineer state in writing and show
through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the
engineering requirements of this division for the entire floodplain. As an
alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to
determine a floodway and submit the engineering study to the division for
acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance and approval of the
study by the division, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project
meets all requirements of this division. The floodway shall be defined
according to the definition in division 1 of this article.



   (e)   Based on the best available existing data according to the
state water survey's floodplain information repository, the director shall
compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the
developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to section
46-117(f). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been
higher than the base flood elevation as of the sites first flood insurance
rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this article. The director shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood
insurance rate map identification.



   (f)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use,
the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or
structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be
compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of
excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.1 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams
and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the
areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing
ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood
elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.



   (g)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction,
modification, or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water
as defined in section 46-32 shall obtain a state division of water resources
dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the
start of construction of a dam. If the director finds a dam that does not
have a division of water resources permit, the director shall immediately
notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the
director finds a dam which is believed to be in an unsafe condition, the
director shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the state
emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA) and the dam safety division of
the division of water resources.

Secs. 46-128--46-150. Reserved.



DIVISION 4. STORMWATER DETENTION



Sec. 46-151. Detention required.



   No person shall cause any development on any property in the village
without providing stormwater detention facilities as described and specified
in this division.



(Code 1965, § 40.401)



Sec. 46-152. Exceptions.



   The director may waive the requirement for detention facilities when
one or more of the following conditions exist:



      (1)   The proposed development consists of home improvements
or additions to an existing residence and the improvements will not increase
the value of the premises by more than 50 percent of its then current value.



      (2)   The proposed development consists of restoring existing
improvements which have been damaged by fire, storm or flood.



      (3)   The property to be developed is all or a wholly
contained part of an approved development for which stormwater detention was
previously provided or planned to the satisfaction of village authorities in
the form of onsite detention, off-site detention, cash in lieu thereof, or
some combination of the above. Development of property shall be allowed to
take place according to the conditions of previously approved detention
standards and stipulations; provided, however, that previously approved
concept plans and/or preliminary plats shall not retain their approved status
for stormwater detention proposals for longer than one year if no
construction or development takes place within that time.



      (4)   The proposed improvement consists of the construction of
a single-family house on an existing platted lot within a previously platted
subdivision.



(Code 1965, § 40.402)



Sec. 46-153. Drainage plan required.



   When a detention facility is required or proposed, the applicant shall
submit plans and information providing the following data to ensure that the
provisions of this article are met. The submittal shall include sufficient
information to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the property,
the potential adverse impacts of the development on water resources both
onsite and downstream, and the effectiveness of the proposed drainage plan in
managing stormwater runoff. The applicant shall certify on the drawings that
all clearing, grading, drainage, and construction shall be accomplished in
strict conformance with the drainage plan. The following information shall be
submitted for both existing and proposed property conditions.



      (1)   Properties smaller than five acres. On properties
smaller than five acres drainage plans shall contain the following:



         a.   Topographic map. A topographic survey of the
property and areas upstream and downstream necessary to determine off-site
impacts of the proposed drainage plan at one-foot contours.

         10.   Detention facilities;



         11.   Roads and streets and associated stormwater inlets;



         12.   Base flood elevation and regulatory floodway where
identified for the property;



         13.   Basis of design for the final drainage network
components; and 



         14.   Other pertinent information determined to be
necessary by the director.



      (2)   Properties of five or more acres. The same information
as required in subsection (1) of this section is required for properties of
five or more acres, plus the following additional information for the minor
drainage system's design runoff event and the 100-year runoff event of
critical duration:



         a.   Elevations and maps of flooding;



         b.   Cross section data for open channel flow paths;



         c.   Direction of storm flows;



         d.   Flow rates and velocities at critical points in the
drainage system; and



         e.   A statement by the project engineer of the drainage
system's provisions for handling events greater than the 100-year runoff.



(Code 1965, § 40.403)



Sec. 46-154. Minimization of runoff volumes and rates.



   In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant
shall choose a strategy which strives to minimize the increase in runoff
volumes and rates from the site. The applicant shall observe the following
hierarchy in developing a drainage plan:



      (1)   Minimization of impervious surfaces on the property;



      (2)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and
retention of natural depressions or construction of new ones in conjunction
with retention of existing natural stream channels;



      (3)   Infiltration of runoff onsite;



      (4)   Stormwater retention structures;



      (5)   Stormwater detention structures; and



      (6)   Storm sewers.



At all times the applicant shall keep in mind groundwater quality and public
safety and convenience in the selection of drainage plan elements.



(Code 1965, § 40.404)



Sec. 46-155. Release rates.



   (a)   Generally. The drainage system for a property shall be
designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the
two-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause
an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in
aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities.
The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall
not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property. The 100-year discharge
shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property.



   (b)   Small development sites. When the calculated allowable
discharge for a development site is exceptionally small due to the small size
of the site, i.e. three acres or less, the director may allow a greater rate
of discharge, provided the developer's engineer demonstrates that appropriate
attempts had been made to develop a design for a discharge device which could
be reasonably expected to function effectively without undue personal
attention or maintenance efforts. In no case will discharge orifices less
than two inches in inside diameter be required. Project engineers shall be
expected to utilize, to the extent practicable, innovative and high-tech
solutions for discharge facilities intended to minimize discharges for small
site detention basins.



(Code 1965, § 40.405)



Sec. 46-156. Water quality and multiple uses.



   (a)   The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse
water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins
shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants.
Detention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the
property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to
reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.



   (b)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses to the
maximum extent feasible. Uses considered compatible with stormwater
management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation
(boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The
applicant shall attempt to avoid using portions of the property exclusively
for stormwater management.



(Code 1965, § 40.406)



Sec. 46-157. Hydrologic design procedures.



   (a)   Development and evaluation. The design of the drainage system
shall be developed and evaluated by the applicant based on routing runoff
hydrographs for the two-year, ten-year, and 100-year, 24-hour events through
its minor and major components. In addition, a general assessment of the
impacts of flows exceeding the 100-year event shall be presented.



   (b)   Rainfall. Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage
system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the
Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70. First quartile median point rainfall
distribution as described by Huff of the ISWS shall be assumed for discharge
estimations. SCS Type II distributions shall also be acceptable for detention
basin design.



   (c)   Hydrograph required. Runoff must be developed as part of the
design of the drainage system's minor and major components. The TR-55 design
procedure, or other method approved by the director, shall be utilized for
generation of hydrographs, subject to rainfall distribution modifications,
for all properties larger than five acres. The rational formula shall not be
used to estimate peak discharges for properties larger than five acres.



   (d)   Antecedent moisture. All computations of runoff hydrographs
which do not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture
conditions shall assume the following antecedent moisture conditions:



      SCS TR-55, antecedent moisture condition two; and



      ILLUDAS, number 3, "rather wet."



(Code 1965, § 40.407)



Sec. 46-158. Hydraulic design procedures.



   (a)   Profile and mapping of floodwater depths. A profile and
mapping of floodwater depths and coverage shall be prepared for the property
for the two-year, ten-year, and 100-year events. Direction of flow and
velocities shall also be reported for critical points in the drainage system.



   (b)   Detention. The minimum available storage to be provided in a
detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event
and reservoir routing (also called level pool), or equivalent.



   (c)   Streets. If streets are to be used for storage of excess
stormwater, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one
inch and shall not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event
less than or equal to the 100-year event.



(Code 1965, § 40.408)



Sec. 46-159. Wet basins.



   (a)   Design goals. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove
stormwater pollutants, to be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available
for recreational use.



   (b)   Depths. Wet basins shall be at least eight feet deep (three
feet if aerated), excluding nearshore banks and safety ledges. If fish
habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25
percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out.



   (c)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet
basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed
for the two-year event.



   (d)   Nuisance control. Wet basins shall be designed in a manner
which will reduce as much as practicable nuisance problems such as algae.



(Code 1965, § 40.409)



Sec. 46-160. Dry basins.



   (a)   Design goals. Dry basins shall be designed to remove
stormwater pollutants, to be safe, and, as much as feasible, to be available
for multiple uses.



   (b)   Drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of
their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any
runoff event less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet
control shall be used if necessary to accomplish the requirements of this
subsection.



   (c)   Water quality. All dry detention basins shall be designed to
remove stormwater pollutants.



(Code 1965, § 40.410)



Sec. 46-161. Safety.



   (a)   Design of drainage system components. The drainage system
components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the
safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during
runoff events.



   (b)   Shorelines. The shorelines of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into
the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Shorelines shall not
have greater than three to one (horizontal to vertical) slope.



   (c)   Banks. The sideslopes of the banks of both wet and dry
detention basins shall not be steeper than three to one.



   (d)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level
safety ledge extending three feet into the basin from the shoreline and two
feet below the normal water depth.



   (e)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.



   (f)   Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be
provided with clearly defined overflow facilities capable of safely passing
overflows so that downstream damage to properties is prevented.



(Code 1965, § 40.411)



Sec. 46-162. Infiltration practices.



   Infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement
shall only be allowed in soils considered A or B by the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service. Infiltration practices shall not be located within 75
feet of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling
basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows
before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be
allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80 percent of a dry basin's bottom
area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom of
infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above seasonally high
groundwater and bedrock. (Code 1965, § 40.412)



Sec. 46-163. Detention in floodplains.



   (a)   Detention basins shall not be permitted in floodways.



   (b)   The stormwater detention requirements of this article may be
fulfilled by providing increased storage capacity within flood fringe areas
on the project site. The placement of a detention basin in flood fringe areas
shall require compensatory storage for 1.1 times the volume below the base
flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The
release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled
consistent with the requirements of section 46-155. The applicant shall
certify its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions.
Excavations for compensatory storage along streams and watercourses shall be
opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain
storage lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing
ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood
elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse.



   (c)   On-stream detention basins are allowable if they provide
regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this
article with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and
100-year, 24-hour events from the property. If on-stream detention is used
for watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the
applicant use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not
increase stage for any properties upstream or downstream of the property.
Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention shall:



      (1)   Not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as
for spawning;



      (2)   Not cause or contribute to the degradation of water
quality or stream aquatic habitat;



      (3)   Include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin; and



      (4)   Comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Chapter Part 708
dated November 29, 1988, and this article.



(Code 1965, § 40.413)



Sec. 46-164. Detention in wetlands.



   Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater
detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modification, including
such activities as filling, draining, excavation and vegetation removal, will
maintain or improve habitat, and water quality. Before a use permit is issued
for developments containing wetlands, the applicant shall execute a
maintenance agreement with the village guaranteeing that the applicant and
all future owners of the property will maintain such existing or modified
wetlands so as to continue to provide wetland functions. The maintenance
agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the village to
enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections of the wetland
systems. Such agreement shall be recorded with the county recorder of deeds
or county registrar of titles, as appropriate. The maintenance agreement
shall stipulate that if the director notifies the property owner in writing
of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall
make such corrections within 90 calendar days of such notification. The
agreement shall also provide that if the corrections are not made within this
time period, the village may have the necessary work completed and recover
the costs associated with such work from the property owner.



(Code 1965, § 40.414)



Sec. 46-165. General detention considerations for water quality enhancement.



   (a)   Inlet and outlet orientation. As much as feasible, the
distance between detention inlets and outlets should be maximized. If
possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin.



   (b)   Velocity dissipation. Baffles or berms should be placed
perpendicular to the direction of flow through a detention basin to reduce
velocity and prevent scour.



   (c)   Maintenance. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed
to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes should be designed
to allow lawn-mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins should be
provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the
pool for sediment removal. Presedimentation basins should be considered for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment should
be provided.



(Code 1965, § 40.415)



Sec. 46-166. Protection of depressional storage.



   The stormwater storage capacity in wetlands and in natural storage
areas identified in the "Floodplain Management Study: Butterfield Creek and
Tributaries," (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service and
state department of transportation, division of water resources, November
1987) shall be maintained. This stormwater storage capacity shall be
maintained on the development site or shall be compensated within the
watershed at a site designated by the director. Storage required to meet the
stormwater detention criteria of this article shall be provided in addition
to the existing identified depressional storage capacity.



(Code 1965, § 40.416)



Sec. 46-167. Protection of wetlands.



   Wetlands shall be protected from the adverse changes in runoff quality
and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other
requirements of this article, the following mitigation criteria shall be met
for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands:



      (1)   The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures as
approved by the village.



      (2)   All runoff from the development shall be routed through
a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year,
24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to
an existing wetland. This basin shall be constructed before property grading
begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in this division should
be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the
wetland.



      (3)   A buffer strip at least 25 feet in width, preferably
vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained around the periphery
of the wetland.



(Code 1965, § 40.417)



Sec. 46-168. Flows from tributary areas.



   Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be
considered in the design of the property's drainage system as follows:



      (1)   Upstream areas not meeting article requirements. When
there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this article,
tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on the
applicant's property shall be considered by the applicant. The following
steps shall be followed.



         a.   The applicant shall compute the storage volume
needed for his property using the release rates prescribed in this section,
the applicant's property area, and the procedures described in this section.



         b.   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not
meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this article, shall be
identified.



         c.   Using the areas determined above, plus the
applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties
shall be computed.



         d.   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the
combined property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in this
section. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed
land cover shall be assumed for the purposes of computing storage.



         e.   Once the necessary combined storage is computed,
the village may choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin
to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be
limited to the storage for his property as computed in subsection (1)a of
this section. If regional storage is selected by the village, then the design
produced in subsection (1)c of this section shall be implemented. If regional
storage is rejected by the village, the applicant has the option of bypassing
all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin. If the applicant
chooses to route them through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one
square mile in size, the applicant must meet the provisions of on-stream
basins.



      (2)   Upstream areas meeting article requirements. When there
are areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this
article tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall
either be bypassed around the applicant's detention basin or be routed
through the applicant's detention basin at the discretion of the village.
Storage needed for the applicant's property shall still be computed as
described in this section. However, if the village decides to route tributary
area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases
shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus
tributary areas.



(Code 1965, § 40.418)



Sec. 46-169. Early completion of detention facilities.



   Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be
used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be completed
before general property grading begins. This is to ensure that if soil
erosion and sediment control practices are not adequately implemented, any
eroded sediment will be captured in these areas and will have to be removed
by the applicant before project completion.



(Code 1965, § 40.419)



Sec. 46-170. Fee in lieu of detention.



   (a)   The village may negotiate with any applicant for a site
development permit, the payment of a fee by the applicant for each acre-foot
of detention which would be required under this article rather than
installing detention facilities on the property.



   (b)   In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale
can be achieved, it will be permissible, and may be required, for adjacent
properties to utilize a common regional detention basin. The applicant shall
have the option of paying a fee determined by the village at the time of
permit application so that the village can build regional facilities, or they
can jointly build the necessary facilities themselves. (Code 1965, § 40.420)

DIVISION 5. EROSION CONTROL



Sec. 46-201. General criteria and standards.



The following general principles shall apply to any movement of earth and any
sedimentation and erosion control plan and the granting of a permit for the
execution of such plan as provided in this section:



      (1)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at
any given time during development.



      (2)   Such minimum area exposure of excavation shall be kept
to as short a duration of time as is practical.



      (3)   Temporary vegetation and, where appropriate, mulching or
other soil stabilization measures shall be used to protect areas exposed
during development, including temporary stock piles of earth. Such temporary
stabilization shall be applied to exposed areas within 15 days, including
areas not at final grade but which will remain undisturbed for longer than 60
days.



      (4)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or
silt trap shall be installed prior to the initiation of grading activities
and shall be maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land
undergoing development.



      (5)   Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development.



      (6)   Permanent, final plant covering or structures shall be
installed as soon as possible.



      (7)   The plan of development shall conform as closely as
possible to the topography and soils of the site so that the lowest potential
for erosion is created.



      (8)   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected
so far as is consistent with developing the site.



      (9)   Site improvements and structures shall be constructed in
accordance with the building code, this article and other village ordinances.



(Code 1965, § 40.501)



Sec. 46-202. Standards for design.



   The provisions of "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control in Northeastern Illinois," first edition, as compiled by the
Soil Conservation District, USDA, as may be amended from time to time, are
hereby incorporated into this article and made a part of this division by
this reference, for purposes of clarifying the considerations and factors
which should enter into the preparation of a site plan for any development.



(Code 1965, § 40.502)



Sec. 46-203. Standards for conducting improvement work.



   (a)   Applicability of section. All earthmoving and grading
operations not specifically exempted by the provisions of this article shall
comply with the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this
article in addition to all other requirements of this article and other
village ordinances. Further, all necessary sedimentation measures shall be
inspected and approved before additional site grading is authorized.



   (b)   Handbooks adopted by reference. Soil erosion and sedimentation
control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with
"Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in
Illinois" (1988), also known as the "Green Book" and "Standards and
Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (EPA, 1987). In the
event of conflict between provisions of such handbook and other provisions of
this article, such provisions of this article shall govern.



(Code 1965, § 40.503)



Sec. 46-204. Activities in floodways.



   (a)   For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and
stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.



   (b)   For all activities in the floodway, including grading,
filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed
soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed
consistent with the following criteria:



      (1)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the
initiation of improvements.



      (2)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be
applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil
stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached
on any portion of the site, and within 15 days of vegetation removal to
denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for
longer than 60 days.



      (3)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before
any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the
movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment
control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams,
diversion ditches, and sediment basins.



      (4)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width
shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels. Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary
stream crossings of nonerodable materials shall be constructed, where
necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels
shall be restabilized immediately.



(Code 1965, § 40.504)



Sec. 46-205. Special precautions.



   (a)   If at any stage of grading operations the director determines
by inspection that the nature of the soil conditions is such that further
work is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage
structure, the director may require, as a condition to allowing the work to
continue, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as he considers
advisable to remove the likelihood of such peril. Special precautions may
include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope,
construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction,
or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and reports
of a soils engineer and/or of an engineering geologist whose recommendations
may be made requirements of further work.



   (b)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the
grading is not complete, work may be stopped, and the permittee may be
required to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary
structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual
site conditions prevail, the director may specify the time of starting
grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective
measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

DIVISION 6. ASSURANCES OF COMPLETION



Sec. 46-231. Required.



   A permit shall not be issued for any improvements regulated by this
article when the cost of all site work is in excess of $1,000.00, unless the
permittee shall first post with the village a cash bond or a bond executed by
the permittee and a corporate surety authorized to do business in the state
as a surety or other assurance device in an amount sufficient to cover the
cost of the project site work as determined by the village. The assurance
device shall be in a form approved by the village attorney.



(Code 1965, § 40.601)



Sec. 46-232. Bond conditions.



   Every bond shall include the conditions that the permittee shall:



      (1)   Comply with all of the provisions of this article,
applicable laws, and other ordinances;



      (2)   Comply with all of the terms and conditions of the
permit for the work to the satisfaction of the director; and



      (3)   Complete all of the work contemplated under the permit
within the time limit specified in the permit. The director may, for
sufficient cause, extend the time specified in the permit but no such
extension shall release the surety upon the bond.



(Code 1965, § 40.602)



Sec. 46-233. Failure to complete work.



   The term of each assurance device shall begin upon the date of the
permit approval and shall remain in effect until the completion of the work
to the satisfaction of the village. In the event of failure to complete the
work and failure to comply with all conditions and terms of the permit, the
director may order the work required by the permit to be completed to his
satisfaction and shall notify the surety of the default in writing. The
surety executing such assurance device shall continue to be firmly bound
under a continuing obligation for the payment of all necessary costs and
expenses that may be incurred or expended by the village in causing any and
all such required work to be done. In the case of a cash deposit, said
deposit or any unused portion thereof shall be refunded to the permittee
after the work is accepted.



(Code 1965, § 40.603)



Sec. 46-234. Assurances through loan commitment.



   In lieu of providing assurance of construction in the manner provided
in section 46-231, the permittee may provide assurance of construction for
improvements by delivering to the village, prior to the issuance of a permit,
an appropriate agreement between an approved lending institution and the
permittee, stating that funds sufficient to cover the entire cost of
performing the proposed work, including engineering and inspection costs and
in an amount approved by the director, have been deposited with such approved
lending institution, or have been committed to be loaned by such lending
institution to the permittee. Such agreement shall provide that such funds in
the stated amount are specifically allocated, and will be used by the
permittee, or on his behalf, only for the purpose of performing the
improvements. The village shall be the beneficiary of such agreement, and the
director shall approve each disbursement of any such funds. The agreement
shall also contain such terms, conditions and provisions as reasonably
determined to be necessary by the village attorney.



(Code 1965, § 40.604)



Sec. 46-235. Exceptions.



   The requirements for assurances may be waived by the village under the
following conditions:



      (1)   The permittee is a municipal, county, or state
department whose functions require the installation and/or maintenance of
public improvements.



      (2)   The permittee is a corporation whose franchise with the
village empowers it to make its own surface restoration, but such permits
will be issued only when the restoration work keeps fully apace with surface
openings being made. Such corporations shall pay promptly all bills for
inspection at scheduled rates, and all bills for restoration done by village
forces.



      (3)   The permittee is a developer who has currently in
existence assurances satisfactory to the village under the provisions of the
subdivision regulations, provided the proposed improvements do not exceed the
scope of the improvement for which such assurances were accepted.

DIVISION 7. INSPECTIONS AND TESTING



Sec. 46-256. Consent for inspections.



   All work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection
by the village. It shall be unlawful to refuse to permit village authorized
personnel to enter such premises or structure at any reasonable time to make
inspections. It shall be unlawful to interfere with or hinder village
inspectors when in the performance of their duties. An application for a
permit shall constitute the permittee's continuing consent to allow the
village to enter upon the land or improvement for purposes of making
inspections as provided in this article.



(Code 1965, § 40.701)



Sec. 46-257. Surveillance to be provided by village.



   The village shall provide for surveillance, at the discretion of the
director, of all improvements being installed, which are regulated by this
article and ensure their satisfactory completion. The permittee shall pay to
the village the actual cost for providing the construction surveillance
service when the performance of such is required by personnel other than
village employees. In cases of larger projects, such as subdivision
developments, the permittee may be required to provide construction
surveillance services by contract with a professional firm qualified to
perform such services. The selection of the firm, the scope of services and
the assignment of personnel under such arrangements shall be subject to
approval by the director.



(Code 1965, § 40.702)



Sec. 46-258. Testing required.



   When deemed necessary by the village, materials and/or compaction shall
be tested in accordance with the requirements of the director. Such testing,

DIVISION 1. GENERALLY



Sec. 54-31. Declaration of policy and intent of article.



   It is hereby found and declared that in the village the movements and
shifts of population and the changes in residential, commercial and
industrial use and customs tend to threaten with disappearance areas, places,
buildings, structures, works of art and other objects having a special
historical, community or aesthetic interest or value and whose preservation
and continued utilization are necessary and desirable to sound community
planning and the welfare of the residents of this village. The authority
provided in section 54-32 is directed to such ends, and the use of such
rights and powers as provided in section 54-32 for the preservation and
continued utilization of such property is hereby declared to be a public use
essential to the public interest of this village.



(Code 1965, § 19.01)



Sec. 54-32. Authority to designate.



   (a)   Village board. The village board shall have the power to
provide for official landmark designation by ordinance of areas, places,
buildings, structures, works of art and other objects having a special
historical, community or aesthetic interest or value. In connection with such
areas, places, buildings, structures, works of art or other objects so
designated by ordinance, whether owned or controlled privately or by any
public body, to provide special conditions; to impose regulations governing
construction, alterations, demolition and use; to deny application for
building demolition permits and building permits to add to, modify, or remove
a portion of any such landmark building; and to adopt other additional
measures appropriate for their preservation, protection, enhancement,
rehabilitation, reconstruction, perpetuation, or use, which additional
measures may include, but are not limited to, the authority given to all
municipalities by 65 ILCS 5/11-48.2-2.



   (b)   New or special commission. The village board may at any time,
by ordinance, create a new or special commission, board or department or
designate an existing commission, board or department to administer the
powers and purposes described in subsection (a) of this section in lieu of
the village board or as an advisory assistant to the village board, in
accordance with the authority found in 65 ILCS 5/11-48.2-3.



(Code 1965, § 19.02)



Sec. 54-33. Procedure.



   Any individual or group of individuals wishing to have a site
designated as an official landmark shall make application to the village on a
form to be developed by the village staff. The village board may also
initiate such application on its own motion. The application shall describe
the site to be designated and shall include a detailed statement of the
reasons why the applicant believes the site should be designated as an
official landmark. Each such application shall be scheduled for informal
review at a public meeting of the village board. At the conclusion of that
informal review, if the village board believes that the application merits
further consideration, they shall schedule a public hearing, at which time
testimony may be given for and against such designation. At the conclusion of
that public hearing, the village board may either deny that application,
instruct the village attorney to draft the necessary ordinance establishing
the property as an official landmark, refer the matter for additional study
or advice, or take any other action authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11- 48.2-1 et
seq. When designating any property as an official landmark, the village board
shall support that designation with findings of fact based upon testimony
given at such public hearing.



(Code 1965, § 19.03)



Sec. 54-34. Notice.



   No action taken by the village under this article directing a private
owner to do or refrain from doing any specific thing, or refusing to permit a
private owner to do some specific thing he desires to do, in connection with
property designated by ordinance under this article, shall be taken by the
village except after due notice to such owner and opportunity for such owner
to be heard at the public hearing required under section 54-33. The
expression "due notice" shall mean a minimum of 15 days' written notice to
the actual owner of record of the subject property. Such notice shall either
be hand delivered or mailed by certified or registered mail. The 15- day
period shall begin to run from the date the notice is delivered to the owner
of record or the date the notice is deposited by either certified or
registered mail in the United States mail, addressed to the owner of record
at his place of residence. If the address of one or more owners of the
subject property cannot be located by the village, notice of the public
hearing may be given to any such owner by publication of the time and place
of the hearing and the purpose of the hearing, including the commonly known
address and legal description of the subject property, in a newspaper of
general circulation within the village, at least 15 days prior to the public
hearing.



(Code 1965, § 19.04)

   In determining whether property should be given an official landmark
designation, the village board, or any other commission, board or department
acting under the authority of this article, shall consider the following

under this article:



      (1)   The site has major architectural or aesthetic

an official landmark, a certified copy of that ordinance shall be furnished
to the property owner within ten days after its effective date. Failure of

not invalidate the force and effect of that ordinance. This section shall be
satisfied by personal delivery or by the depositing of the certified copy in
the United States mail by either certified or registered mail within the
ten-day period, addressed to the owner at his last known place of residence
or business or, if not known, then in care of the address of the landmark

Sec. 58-94.  Charges; conciliation.



   (a)   Any person aggrieved in any manner by an alleged violation of
any provision of this division may file with the commission a written
verified charge setting forth that grievance. The village clerk is hereby
authorized to accept such charges and forward them to the commission. The
charge shall state the name and address of the complainant, the name and
address of the person against whom the charge is brought, if known to the
complainant, and the alleged facts surrounding the alleged violation. Such
charge shall state the name and address of all persons believed to have
knowledge concerning the alleged facts. The commission shall provide a
printed form of charge for the use of aggrieved persons.



   (b)   The charge shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $25.00
which shall be deposited with the village treasurer. If, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this section, the commission or a panel of the
commission shall determine that probable cause does exist for the allegations
of the charge, or if the alleged violation or charge is disposed of by
conference, conciliation or persuasion, or if any of the charges alleged in
the charge are sustained, the village treasurer, upon recommendation of the
commission, shall return the filing fee to the complainant. If it is
determined that probable cause does not exist for the allegations of the
charge, or the charges alleged in the charge are not sustained, the filing
fee shall be retained by the village.



   (c)   After filing of any charge, the commission shall, within 30
days thereafter, acknowledge to the complainant that the charge has been
received, serve a copy of the charge on the party charged, and the chairman
of the commission shall designate a panel to make a prompt investigation in
connection therewith.



   (d)   Within 100 days after receipt of the complaint, that panel
shall prepare a written report of its investigation for the commission and
shall determine, in writing, either that "probable cause exists for the
allegations of the charge" or that "probable cause does not exist for the
allegations of the charge." If it is impracticable to complete the
investigation within 100 days, the complainant and the charged party shall be
notified, in writing, of the reasons for not doing so. If such panel shall
determine that probable cause does exist, the panel shall set a time and date
for a meeting, and at such meeting, the panel or any member thereof shall
interview the complainant and the person against whom the charge has been
directed and shall attempt to resolve the charge by all proper methods of
conciliation and persuasion. The relief provided for in section 58-96(b) and
section 58-98 may be sought during conciliation. The conciliation agreement
may provide for binding arbitration of the dispute arising from the charge.
Arbitration may award appropriate relief as provided for in this division.
The aggrieved person and the respondent may, in the conciliation agreement,
limit the types of relief that may be awarded under binding arbitration. All
conciliation agreements must be approved by the village only after the
village determines that the aggrieved person and those charged agree to the
relief provided for in the conciliation agreement and the provisions of the
conciliation agreement adequately vindicate the public interest. If at any
time within 60 days after the date of filing of the charge such panel shall
determine that such attempts at conciliation would not be in furtherance of
the objectives of this division, the commission shall thereupon proceed
promptly to a full hearing of the charge in accordance with section 58-95.

call witnesses on their own behalf and to cross examine witnesses. Closed
meetings may be held as permitted by 65 ILCS 5/11-11.1-1 et seq.



   (b)   Within 30 days after the completion of such hearing, the
commission shall render a written report of that hearing to the village
board. That report shall contain a copy of the charge filed, a summary or
transcript of testimony heard and evidence presented, and shall contain the
commission's findings and recommendations as to disposition of the charges.

the occupants of the park.



   (c)   Water supply. An adequate supply of water of safe, sanitary
quality, approved by the building inspector, shall be furnished at a trailer

   (e)   Sewage. All sewage and other water-carried wastes shall be
disposed of into the municipal sewer system whenever available. In a trailer
coach park in which such connections are not available, disposal shall be

operation of which creates neither a nuisance nor a menace to health, and
which has previously been approved by the village administration. When a
water carriage system of sewage is used, each trailer coach site shall be
provided with a sewer connection for the combined liquid waste outlets of the
trailer coach, and trapped below the frostline. It shall be the duty of the
owner or operator of the trailer coach park to provide an approved type of
water and odortight connection from the trailer water drainage to the sewer
connection, and it shall be the duty of the owner or operator to make such
connection and keep all occupied trailer coaches connected to the sewer while
located in the trailer coach park. Sewer connections in unoccupied trailer
coach sites shall be so closed that they will not emit odors or cause a
breeding place for insects. No water or waste shall be allowed to fall on the
ground from a trailer coach.

under all circumstances of the case but shall not extend beyond one year from
the date of imposition of such order of supervision. When placing a minor on

by law. No minor assigned to a public service work program shall be
considered an employee of the village for any purpose, nor shall the village

Sec. 70-147. Obscenity.



   (a)   Defined. As used in this section, any material or performance
is obscene if:



      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the
prurient interest;



      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult
community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether
normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory
functions or lewd exhibition of genitals; and



      (3)   A reasonable person, taking the material or performance
as a whole, would find it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value.



   (b)   Unlawful acts designated. It is unlawful when a person, either
with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to
exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or
content thereof:



      (1)   Sells, delivers or provides or offers or agrees to sell,
deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other
representation or embodiment of the obscene;



      (2)   Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other

represented or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.



   (c)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity
especially adapted for reproducing multiple copies or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.



   (d)   Interpretation of evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with
reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference
to children or other especially susceptible audiences if it appears from the
character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be
specially designed for or directed to such an audience. Where circumstances
of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity
indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.



   (e)   Defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that
the dissemination:



      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates
other than children under 18 years of age.



      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or
other special justification for possession of such material.



   (f)   Penalty for violation of section. Any person violating this
section for the first time shall be punishable by a fine as provided in

family, business, public lands and manufacturing zoning areasof the village,
and are authorized to seek the advice and counsel of local qualified
professionals in the fields of architecture, ecology, and land planning in
the creation of the appearance plan.  Said appearance plan shall be based on
the intent and purposes of this chapter, as set forth in section 78.121.



   Said plan shall be intended as the standard, or guideline for future
physical developments, in said zoning districts, and should consider, amongst
other features:



   (a)   The external architectural features of  proposed buildings
and landscaping and site planning thereof.

a public hearing thereon.  A copy of the proposed plan shall be on file
during regular business hours at the office of the village clerk in the
village hall for public inspection at least 7 days prior to that public
hearing and at all times after its adoption.  Notice of the public hearing
shall be made as required by the Illinois Open Meetings Act.  The hearing
may be adjourned from time to time.  Within 30 days after final adjournment
of the hearing, the commission shall recommend a final appearance plan to the
board of trustees.



(MC-896, § 1, 10-8-13)



Sec. 78-130.  Adoption by board of trustees.

Sec. 78-131.  Amendments.



   The appearance plan may be amended, by the board of trustees after

proposed amendment. The appearance commission shall make a recommendation as
to amendments only after holding a public hearing after notice as set forth
in section 78-129 hereof.



Sec. 78-132.  Regulatory powers of commission over external architectural
features of buildings and structures.



   (a)   When a building permit or other permit required under the
ordinances of the village is requested for the erection, construction,
alteration or repair of any building or structure other than a single family
residence building, no such building permit or other permit shall be issued
by the building inspector except upon the granting of a recommendation for
approval by the appearance commission.  The foregoing requirement shall not
preclude the issuance of a building permit without such recommendation, if
the building inspector determines that no external architectural feature, as
defined in section 78-128,is involved in the work for which the building
permit is sought. 



   No permit required under the ordinances of the village shall be issued
to allow the moving of any structure or building whether industrial,
commercial or residential, including single family and multi-family onto any
lot in the village except upon the granting of a recommendation for approval
by the appearance commission. 



   (b)   Recommendation for approval - when required.  When a proposed
building or development must be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission  the petitioner shall be assigned to appear before the appearance
commission at the earliest possible date, but subsequent to any required
hearing before  the Planning and Zoning Commission.



   (c)   Recommendation for approval -  preliminary consideration. 
The appearance commission shall, at the written request of a prospective
applicant for a recommendation for approval, give consideration to
preliminary exterior drawings, elevations, sketches, landscape and site plans
and materials on a specific project before a formal application is filed, and
shall provide such advice, counsel, suggestions and recommendations on
matters pertaining to aesthetics as they may deem necessary to guide said
prospective applicant in the development of a plan which would comply with
the requirements and purposes of the appearance plan. The commission shall
act in an advisory capacity only, with regard to preliminary plans, and shall
provide consultation only on projects for which preliminary drawings and
materials are furnished by a prospective applicant, and shall not participate
in the development of the basic concept, plans or drawings.



   All hearings on preliminary plans are to be public, and are to be held
in accordance with the provisions and requirements established in section
78-132(d) (final hearings).



   Upon finding that the preliminary exterior drawings, sketches,
landscape and site plans and materials are appropriate to, or compatible
with, the character of the immediate neighborhood, and will tend to effect
the general purposes of the appearance plan, the commission shall issue a
preliminary approval.  Said approval will be irrevocable, and makes the
issuance of the recommendation for approval mandatory upon application,
unless the final presentation does not substantially comply in all respects
with the preliminary presentation upon which the preliminary recommendation 
was based.



   If the appearance commission is unwilling to grant a preliminary
recommendation, the applicant can either return with modified plans to secure
the preliminary recommendation or he may return with modified plans for final
approval.  If he elects to seek a final hearing, he may present additional
evidence at that time.



   (d)   Recommendation for approval - final hearings.  Upon the
filing of an application for building permit for which a  recommendation for
approval is or may be required under this section, the building inspector
shall  transmit said application to the appearance commission.  The fact
that an application for a recommendation for approval  has been filed shall
not be cause for the building inspector to delay the review of plans relating
to the building and zoning aspects of the project, while said application is
pending.  The said commission shall, within 15 days fix a reasonable time
for a hearing and give a written 5 day notice thereof to the applicant. 
Notice of that hearing shall be made as required by the Illinois Open
Meetings Act.



   Upon such hearing the commission shall consider the application for 
building permit, and if necessary receive additional evidence from the
applicant or his agent or attorney and from village personnel or other
persons as to whether the external architectural features of the proposed
building or structure comply with the appearance plan.  All testimony given
at such hearing shall be under oath.



   (e)   Action of appearance commission.  If preliminary
consideration has not been requested under the terms and provisions of
section 78-132(c), prior to making its decision the commission may make
recommendations to the applicant as to changes in the exterior drawings,
sketches, landscaping, site plans and materials which in the judgment of the
commission would tend to effect the general purposes of the appearance plan.



   The commission shall make its decision and shall issue to the building
inspector a recommendation for approval, unless the commission finds that the
said plan does not conform to the appearance plan and/or that the proposed
building or structure will be inappropriate to, or incompatible with, the
character of the immediate neighborhood and cause substantial depreciation in
property values.  If preliminary hearings have been held on the project for
which application is being made, and preliminary recommendation has been
issued by the commission as provided in section 78-132 (c), the commission
shall issue a recommendation for approval  immediately, provided that the
final drawings, plans and materials as presented substantially comply in all
respects with the preliminary presentation upon which the preliminary
recommendation  was based.



   (f)   Appeal from appearance commission.  Appeal of any decision or
action of the appearance commission under this section may be taken to the
village board.  Such appeal shall be initiated by a written request to the
village manager asking that the matter be placed on the village board's
agenda for consideration.  Such request must be received by the manager no
later than 30 days after the date of the decision appealed from.



(MC-896, § 1, 10-8-13; MC-951, § 1, 3-22-16)



Sec. 78-133  Follow-up by building inspector.  



   Upon the granting of a recommendation for approval, the exterior
drawings, elevations, sketches, landscape and site plans, renderings and
materials upon which said recommendation for approval was granted shall be
turned over to the building inspector, whose responsibility shall be to
determine, from time to time as the project is in progress, and finally upon
its completion, that there has been progress and finally upon its completion,
that there has been no substantial unauthorized deviation from the
presentation upon which the recommendation for approval  was originally
granted.  Any substantial unauthorized deviation shall be cause for the
building inspector to halt construction of a project which is not
substantially as shown in the sketches, plans and other material submitted
and on which the recommendation for approval was approved.  If a project is
otherwise completed but some phases of the appearance plan have not been
completed, a developer may with the approval of the director of public works
deposit sufficient funds in escrow to complete the project, and obtain a
temporary certificate of occupancy.  That escrow shall be in a form
acceptable to the village.

Sec. 86-12.  Inspections.



   The village shall make inspections of signs as it deems necessary, and

repair, unsafe, or nonconforming to this chapter, the owner shall be notified
in writing of the condition, and if the owner does not remedy the sign within
30 days from the time of the service of the notice, the building inspector
shall act in accordance with section 86-16.



Sec. 86-13.  Nuisances.

nominee is hereby declared to be a nuisance and may be abated as such.



Sec. 86-14.  Maintenance.



   All signs, retractable canopies and awnings shall be kept and

by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the building,
structure or premises upon which such sign may be found, within 30 days after
receipt of written notice by the village to so act.  Upon failure to comply
with such notice within the time specified in such order, the building
inspector is hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign.  Any expense
incident thereto shall be paid by the owner, agent or person having
beneficial use of the building, structure or premises to which such sign is
attached.



Sec. 86-16.  Unsafe and unlawful signs.



   If the building inspector shall find that any sign, retractable canopy
or awning is unsafe or insecure or is a menace to the public, has been
constructed, erected, or is being maintained in violation of the provisions
of this chapter, he shall give written notice of such finding to the
permittee of the same.  If the permittee fails to remove or alter the sign,
retractable canopy or awning so as to bring it into compliance with the
standards established by this chapter within 30 days after receipt of such
notice, such sign, retractable canopy or awning may be removed by the village
at the expense of the permittee.  If, upon reasonable and diligent search,
the permittee cannot be found so that the notice described in this section
cannot be given, then the village may remove the sign, retractable canopy or
awning or, in the alternative, may send written notice of the building
inspector's finding to the owner of the building, structure or premises.  If
the owner then fails to remove or alter the sign, retractable canopy or
awning so as to bring it into compliance with the standards established by
this chapter within 30 days after receipt of such notice, such sign,
retractable canopy or awning may be removed by the village at the expense of

fire or other casualty to the extent that the cost of restoration will exceed
50 percent of the construction cost of a comparable new sign shall not be
restored unless the sign conforms to all current requirements of this
chapter.  If such damage or construction is less than 50 percent of the
construction cost of a comparable new sign, all repairs shall be completed
within 180 days from the date of the partial destruction.  If such damage or
destruction is less than 50 percent of the construction cost of a comparable
new sign and repair construction is not completed within 180 days from the
date of partial destruction, then the damaged nonconforming sign shall not be
restored unless the sign is made to conform to all current regulations of
this chapter.



      (3)   Such signs shall be properly maintained as required by
this chapter, but authorized maintenance shall not include the right to
change or alter the size, shape, context, wording or appearance of such sign.

ARTICLE VI. CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY.



Sec. 94-188. Purpose and Scope.



   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this Article is to establish
policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within
the Village’s jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent
with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of
the Village rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.



   (b)   Intent.  In enacting this Article, the Village intends to
exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in
particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:



      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks,
alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;



      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions
and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;



      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations
of the Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in
rights-of-way or public property;



      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage
to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;



      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to
structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;



      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which
facilities are installed;



      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined
parkways that characterize the Village's residential neighbor-hoods;



      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of
facilities in the rights-of-way; and



      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private
properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.



   (c)   Facilities Subject to This Article. This Article applies to
all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this Article may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.



   (d)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The Village, in
its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such
an agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent
with this Article.



   (e)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.



      (1)   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In
the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



      (2)   Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any
conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this Article and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the
Village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such
franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the
term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



   (f)   Conflicts with Other Articles. This Article supersedes all
Articles or parts of Articles adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of such conflict.



   (g)   Conflicts with State and Federal Laws. In the event that
applicable Federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the

   (d)   Supplemental Application Requirements for Specific Types of
Utilities. In addition to the requirements of subsection (c) of this Section,
the permit application shall include the following items, as applicable to
the specific utility that is the subject of the permit application:



      (1)   In the case of the installation of a new electric power,

(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-192.  Action on Permit Applications.



   (a)   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit
applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
Village Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If
the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Director of
Public Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor. If the Village Director of Public Works is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Article and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Director of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Village Director of Public Works, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this Article.



   (b)   Additional Village Review of Applications of
Telecommunications Retailers.



      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220
ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it
intends to commence work governed by this Article for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other document-ation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior
to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Village
Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon
which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.



      (2)   In the event that the Village Director of Public Works
fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications
retailer within either (i) ten (10) days after service of notice to the
Village by the tele-communications retailer in the case of work not involving
excavation for new construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days after service
of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving
excavation for new construction, the telecommun-ications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this Article.



      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to Section 94-191 of this
Article the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) of this
Section.



   (c)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. 
Applications by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization
under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted
forty-five (45) days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted
upon by the Village, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



See. 94-193.  Effect of Permit.



   (a)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest
Created.  A permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only
certain activities in accordance with this Article on Village rights-of-way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the
rights-of-way.



   (b)   Duration. No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid
for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.



   (c)   Pre-construction Meeting Required.  No construction shall
begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Chapter prior to attendance by
the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform
any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village
with such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under
the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where
work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other
utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid
disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.



   (d)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by
the Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules,
and regulations.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-194.  Revised Permit Drawings.



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or
plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit.  If any
deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this
Article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with
Section 94-208 of this Article. If the Village denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the
right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and
submit revised drawings or plans therefor.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-195.  Insurance.



   (a)   Required Coverages and Limits.  Unless otherwise provided by
franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way
or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain
the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named
insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies
listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below:



      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises- operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations
coverage with limits not less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000) combined
single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, property damage and personal
injury.  The general aggregate shall be twice the required occurrence limit
or a project/contract specific aggregate.



      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired
vehicles with a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for
bodily injury and property damage for each accident;



      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and



      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less
than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident. The
contractor's insurance coverage shall be primary as respects the Village, its
officials, agents, employees and volunteers.  Any insurance or
self-insurance maintained by the Village, its officials, agents, employees
and volunteers shall be excess of contractor's insurance and shall not
contribute with it. If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect
the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors
and subcontractors shall comply with this Section.



   (b)   Excess or Umbrella Policies.  The coverages required by this
Section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella
policies.  Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over
underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss
covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy,
the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.



   (c)   Copies Required.  The utility shall provide copies of any of
the policies required by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.



   (d)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages.  The insurance
policies required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:



      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."



   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and
in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this Section.



   (e)   Self-Insurance.  A utility may self-insure all or a portion
of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a)
of this Section.  A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent
of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirements of subsections (b),
(c) and (d) of this Section.  A utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under subsection (a) of this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a
"private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.



   (f)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's
Liability.  The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or
self-insurance required by this Section shall not be limited by such
insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts
thereunder.



   (g)   Insurance Companies.  All insurance provided pursuant to this
Section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of
Illinois.  [All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated
"A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.]



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07; MC-797, § 1, 1-8-08)



Sec. 94-196.  Indemnification.



   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from
or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Article or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the sole negligence, misconduct or breach of this Article by
the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07; MC-796, § 1, 1-8-08)



Sec. 94-197.  Security.



   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this Section.  The Security Fund shall
be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee's
sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for:



      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this Article;



      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued
pursuant to this Article; and



      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Article including,
without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this Article to perform that the Village must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the Village from
the permittee pursuant to this Article or any other applicable law.



   (b)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the
Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the Village and the permittee;



      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and



      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and
within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Director of
Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that
the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to
perform such restoration. Where the construction



of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in
multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction
of facilities in one (1) location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village
Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to
each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security
Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would
have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single
phase.



   (d)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for
such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be
made if the permittee:



      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or



      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that
the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.



   (e)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of
written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the
Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount
specified in subsection (c) of this Section.



   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by
the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the
minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this Section.



   (g)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this Article or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a
result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



   (h)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with
respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the
Village, whether reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund
shall affect any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery
with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise
violated.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-198.  Permit Suspension and Revocation.



   (a)   Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or
suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Article for one (1) or more of the
following reasons:



      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially
incomplete statements in the permit application;



      (2)   Non-compliance with this Article;



      (3)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the
rights-of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare; or



      (4)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities
substantially in accordance with the permit and approved plans.



   (b)   Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The Village shall send
written notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to
this Article stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension
and the alternatives available to permittee under this Section.



   (c)   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or
Suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:



      (1)   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no
cause exists for the revocation or suspension;



      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village,
the deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of
such correction to the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of
the written notice of revocation; or



      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over,
above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore
the rights-of-way to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof
of such removal to the Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation.



   The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this subsection.



   (d)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of
revocation or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately
upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within
subsection (a) of this Section.



   (e)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the
permittee fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this
Section, the Village or its designee may, at the option of the Village (1)
correct the deficiencies; (2) upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to
the permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or (3) after not
less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of failure to cure the
non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of
removal.

Sec. 94-199.  Change of Ownership or Owner's Identity or Legal Status.



   (a)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no
less than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility
in the right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of
the utility or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges
enjoyed by the former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations, including this Article, with respect to
the work and facilities in the right-of-way.



   (b)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current
permit be amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a
new or amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to
have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
permit if the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the
Village's right-of-way.



   (c)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or
bonding must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-200.  General Construction Standards.

accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be
expeditiously accomplished.



      (2)   Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in
damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for
cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The
Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees
removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International
Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the
compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village
may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical
pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.



   (c)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or
trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher

Sec. 94-205.  Removal, Relocation, or Modifications of Utility Facilities.



   (a)   Notice. Within ninety (90) days following written notice from
the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the
corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change
or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair,
maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.



   (b)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls,
or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the
rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such
facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is
unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:



      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's
license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;



      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the
prior grant of a license or franchise, if required;



      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without
prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this Article; or



      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a
location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.



   (c)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village
retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within
the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety
emergency. If circumstances permit, the Village shall attempt to notify the
utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify
the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.



   (d)   Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility
within the rights-of-way of the Village, the utility shall notify the Village
within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the Village may
direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the
Village Director of Public Works determines that such removal will be in the
best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the
Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it,
by giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall
be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of
the facility by another utility or person.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-206.  Clean-up and Restoration.



   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten (10) days after any portion of the
rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the Village. This
includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the Village
Director of Public Works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist
of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to
restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that
which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period
provided in this Section may be extended by the Village Director of Public
Works for good cause shown.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-207.  Maintenance and Emergency Maintenance.



   (a)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in
a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.



   (b)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify
non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:



      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion
of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the
right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a
hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on
the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means
of access to the facility is available.



      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible,
notify the Village Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized
agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken
for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the Village police shall be notified
immediately.



      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.



   (c)   Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the
Village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within
forty-eight (48) hours after an emergency repair.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



See. 94-208.  Variances.



   (a)   Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one
(1) or more of the provisions of this Article must do so in writing to the
Village Director of Public Works as a part of the permit application. The
request shall identify each provision of this Article from which a variance
is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.



   (b)   Authority to Grant Variances. The Village Director of Public
Works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of
this Article identified in the variance request on an individual basis.



   (c)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Village Director of
Public Works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:



      (1)   One (1) or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.



   (d)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the Village Director of Public Works
may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards
and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this Article
but which carry out the purposes of this Article.



   (e)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made
by the Village Director of Public Works under the provisions of this Chapter
shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or
commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted
in writing to the Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of
such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall
commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the
appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the appeal.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-209.  Penalties.



   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when
the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit
and this Article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the
cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall
bear the Village 's costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may
review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the Village.
Sanctions may he imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs
apportioned to it.



(MC-793, § 2, 10-23-07)



Sec. 94-210.  Enforcement.



   Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Article.

      (1)   Prepare a preliminary sketch of the proposed subdivision
for use in discussion and consultation with the village manager, village
engineer and village attorney. The purpose of this meeting with village
administrative officials shall be to determine general conformity with all
related village ordinances.

subdivider within 30 days of the filing date of the preliminary plan and
shall render a decision regarding the acceptability of the plan within 60
days of the filing date. The board of trustees shall review any matter in
dispute on the preliminary plan and submit a formal recommendation for
settlement thereof to the plan commission. One copy of the preliminary plan,
as approved by the plan commission, shall be forwarded to the village
manager. All surplus copies of the preliminary plan, as originally submitted,
shall be revised in accordance with the plan as approved by the plan
commission and forwarded, together with formal notification of such approval,
to the owner or subdivider.



      (3)   Upon filing of the preliminary plan, as set forth in
subsection (2) of this section, the owner or subdivider shall pay the
required filing fee. The minimum filing fee including less than, but not more
than, 25 lots shall be $90.00. Proposed subdivision containing a greater
number of lots shall pay according to the following fee schedule:



 

26 through 50 -
 
$90.00, plus $2.00 for each lot in excess of 25.

There shall be no refund of any portion of the filing fee.



      (4)   Where less than the entire land area shown in the
preliminary plan is to be engineered and developed initially, the recordation
of the final plat of the first unit of such development shall automatically
extend the approval of the unrecorded balance of the preliminary plan for a
period of 18 months. The board of trustees, upon request by the subdivider
and with the recommendation of the plan commission, may further extend such
approval for a period not to exceed 12 additional months.

officials having jurisdiction shall then review such data and approve or make
recommendations for revision to the Plan Commission within five days of the
date upon which the final plat was filed.



   (e)   Drainage. No land shall be approved for subdivision which is
subject to periodic flooding. However, if the subdivider agrees to make
improvements which will, in the opinion of the village engineer, make the
area completely safe for residential occupancy; provide adequate drainage; or
conform to the floodplain area provisions of the zoning regulations, the
preliminary plan for subdivision may be approved.

ARTICLE III. FINAL PLATS



Sec. 98-66. Procedure generally.



   (a)   Within six months of the date upon which the preliminary plan
was approved by the Plan Commission, or a period of time not to exceed 12
months, as may be granted by the board of trustees, the owner or subdivider
shall submit to the village manager the original inked linen drawing, plus
ten contact prints of the final plat of the proposed subdivision. Such
drawing and prints shall contain all required certifications as set forth in
section 98-67. All signatures must be affixed using black ink for the purpose
of better reproduction. The final plat shall retain the overall
characteristics of the preliminary plan.



      (1)   The village manager shall refer nine copies of the
contact prints to the Plan Commission for examination and review and one
contact print to the village engineer. The village engineer and other public
officials having jurisdiction shall review the plat and report approval or
recommend revision to the plan commission within five days of the filing
date. The Plan Commission shall not approve the final plat prior to receipt
of the report from the village engineer. In the event of a special problem,
the Plan Commission shall notify the owner or subdivider as to the time and
place of the Plan Commission meeting at which such problem will be discussed.



      (2)   The Plan Commission shall render a decision regarding
the final plat within 45 days of the date on which the plat was submitted.
One copy of the final plat and engineering plans, specifications and
estimates, as approved, shall be forwarded with the Plan Commission's report
to the village manager.



      (3)   Upon receipt of the Plan Commission's report on the
final plat, the village manager shall, within 30 days, refer the final plat
to the Board of Trustees for approval.



      (4)   Following the final approval by the Board of Trustees,
the village manager shall officially notify the owner or subdivider. The
village manager shall cause the final plat to be recorded in the exact form
as approved with the county recorder of deeds within 30 days of the date of
approval by the Board of Trustees. Approval of the final plat by the plan
commission and the Board of Trustees shall be null and void if the plat is
not acceptable for recording in the office of the county recorder of deeds.



      (5)   Where less than the entire land area shown in the final
plat is to be filed for record, each unit recordation shall automatically
extend the approval of the unrecorded balance of the final plat for a period
of 18 months. The Board of Trustees, upon request by the subdivider, may
further extend such approval for a period not to exceed 12 additional months.

(Code 1965, § 32.06)



Sec. 98-68. Accompanying agreements.



   (a)   Guarantee of completion. The final plat shall be accompanied
by an agreement signed by the owner or subdivider and the village manager,
approved by the village attorney, setting forth that plans and specifications
for the required public improvements are complete and have been approved by
the village engineer, and that:



      (1)   A performance bond has been placed with the village
clerk in the amount of 110 percent of the total estimated cost as approved by
the village engineer to guarantee completion of all required public
improvements. The performance bond referred to in this section may be in any
one or combination of the following forms:



         a.   A commercial surety company bond approved by the
village manager and conditioned upon the installation of all required public
improvements within two years of the date of final plat approval. The period
of such surety may be extended as required to guarantee the completion of
required public improvements upon mutual agreement of the subdivider, the
surety company and village manager.



         b.   The placement of cash in a trust account with the
village from which contract payments shall be made upon request by the
subdivider and formal acceptance of the public improvement or improvements by
the board of trustees. Any unused balance of such cash trust shall be
returned to the subdivider upon completion and acceptance of all required
public improvements.



         c.   The placement of acceptable governmental
securities, payable to bearer and properly endorsed to the village.



         d.   The establishment of an escrow account with an
acceptable financial institution. Payment of contract obligations shall be
made from the escrow account only upon request by the subdivider and formal
acceptance of the public improvement or improvements by the board of trustees.



         e.   The placement of a letter of credit from an
acceptable financial institution which guarantees the subdividers credit in
the amount required for the period required to satisfactorily install all
required public improvements, and further, certification of an initial,
separate and distinct subdivision account established by the subdivider in an
amount equal to 110 percent of the cost of all underground improvements.
Contract payments shall be made from such subdivision account only upon
request by the subdivider and formal acceptance of the public improvement or
improvements by the board of trustees. The subdivision account established by
the subdivider shall, at no time during its authorized existence, have a
current and available balance of less than ten percent of the total estimated
cost of all required public improvements.



      (2)   The owner or subdivider may elect, upon specific
permission of the board of trustees, to complete one or more improvements
prior to recordation of the final plat. When such option is selected,
recordation of the final plat shall be contingent upon certification by the
village engineer and the village manager that the improvement or improvements
have been completed in accordance with previously approved engineering plans
and village standards and that all inspection reports applicable thereto are
favorable. No performance surety or bond shall be required with the use of
this method of providing required public improvements except as such may be
required by combination with performance options as specified in this
subsection (a).



   (b)   Damage and nuisance. The agreement regarding guarantee of
completion of public improvements, to be executed by the owner or subdivider
and the village manager prior to the recordation of a final plat of
subdivision, shall also provide for the repair of damages and the abatement
of nuisances with respect to existing and subsequently installed landscaping,
streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, parkways, water and sanitary sewerage
facilities, culverts, catchbasins and/or storm sewers. The damage and
nuisance guarantee referred to in this section shall be in the total or
prorated amount of $1,000.00 per platted block and may be provided by:



      (1)   Specific agreement by the owner or subdivider to place
cash with the village in the amount required upon commencement of building
construction along each public street within each platted block of the
subdivision; or



      (2)   Inclusion, in specific terms, of the amount required
with surety options subsections (a)(1) a, (a)(1) b or (a)(1) c of this
section which guarantee the completion of public improvements.



   The damage and nuisance surety referred to in this section shall be for
the repair of damages and the abatement of nuisances created by the
subdivision regardless of the basis on which the surety amount was computed.
The unused portion of such surety shall be returned by full block or
proration basis as originally computed only upon completion of all building
construction therein.

Cul-de-sac streets . . . . . . .
 
60 feet


Marginal access streets (without intersecting streets) . . . . . . .
 
40 feet


Marginal access streets (with intersecting streets) . . . .
 
50 feet



 



   (b)   Major trafficway standards. Right-of- way widths and other
design standards of major trafficways, including freeways, parkways, major
and secondary thoroughfares shall be in accordance with those designated on
the official plan of the village and environs, and federal, state or county
authorities having jurisdiction.



   (c)   Tangents. Tangents of at least 50 feet in length shall be
introduced between reverse curves on collector streets.



   (d)   Centerline deflections. Where there is a deflection in
horizontal centerlines within a given block at any given point in excess of
ten degrees, a curve shall be inserted with a radius of not less than:



 

Collector streets . . . . . . .
 
300 feet


Minor streets . . . . . . .
 
150 feet



 



   (e)   Connecting street gradients. Different connecting street
gradients shall be connected with vertical parabolic curves. Minimum length
in feet of these curves shall provide a stopping sight distance of not less
than 300 feet.



   (f)   Minor streets; alignment. Minor streets shall be so aligned
that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.



   (g)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets at
intersections of less than 150 feet should be avoided.



   (h)   Intersections and confluences. It must be evidenced that all
street intersections and confluences encourage safe and efficient traffic
flow, and, in general, be at or near right angles avoiding acute angles. An
intersection of more than two streets shall be avoided unless specific
conditions of design indicate otherwise.



   (i)   Alleys. Alleys are not permitted in residential areas unless
deemed necessary by the plan commission.



   (j)   Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac street in a single-family
residential district shall be not more than 500 feet in length, measured
along the centerline from the street of origin to the end of its
right-of-way; provided, however, that no more than 15 lots shall abut the
cul-de- sac street. In multiple-family residential districts such streets
shall not exceed 300 feet in length. Each cul-de-sac shall have a terminus of
nearly circular shape with a minimum diameter of 100 feet.



   (k)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of this chapter; and where the board of trustees finds
it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever an existing or dedicated half
street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within such tract. A half street, where included, shall be
graded at one level, and the regrading or new construction of any half street
shall conform to the grade and pavement of the adjacent half street.



   (l)   Access to residential property. Provision shall be made for
vehicular and pedestrian access to residential property abutting arterial
streets either by providing marginal access streets, or by backing lots to
the arterial street and providing access by a collector, minor, or cul-de-sac
street one lot depth removed. A dedicated, nonaccess fence strip shall be
provided along the rear property line which abuts an arterial street. These
standards are established for the purpose of providing protection to
residential properties and to separate through and local traffic.



   (m)   Grades. Drainage gradients of streets shall be at least 0.4
percent. Street grades shall not exceed five percent on collector streets nor
seven percent on minor streets. Street grades shall be such as to provide
natural surface drainage of stormwater regardless of the presence or absence
of storm sewer facilities. The intent of this subsection is to avoid
depressions greater than one foot in depth along any given street profile
which will flood in flash storms for which storm sewers are inadequate.



   (n)   Underground drainage systems. Underground drainage systems
shall be required when appropriate to the land, as determined by topography
and distance from drainage channels.

   (a)   Easements shall be provided for any overhead or underground
utility service where necessary. Such utility easements shall be at least 7
1/2 feet wide and be established at the rear of each lot and along such other
lot lines as to provide continuity of alignment from block to block. At
deflection points in these easements, additional easements shall be
established for pole-line anchors if overhead utility lines are contemplated.



   (b)   Where easements are necessary to provide stormwater drainage,
such easements shall be at least ten feet wide and be established in the same
manner as utility easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, sufficient right-of-way
adjacent to and including such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream
shall be dedicated for public use to allow for proper maintenance. Such
dedication shall include a strip of land at least ten feet in width on both
sides of the defined watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream. All data

feet, and the maximum length of blocks containing lots of less than 80 feet
in average width shall be 1,320 lineal feet. No blocks shall be less than 660
lineal feet in length unless approved by the plan commission. Pedestrian ways
leading to schools, parks, or other common destinations may be required by
the plan commission.



   (b)   Shape. The shape of blocks shall be dictated by topographical
features, the basic street system and traffic pattern, lot depths, and areas
designated for public and other nonresidential land uses.



   (c)   Designation of use; provisions for required facilities. Blocks
intended for commercial, industrial, and institutional use must be designated
as such, and the plan must show adequate off-street areas to provide for
parking, loading docks, and such other facilities as may be required to
accommodate motor vehicles.



   (d)   When streets may be required. Where a subdivision borders upon
or is traversed by a railroad right-of-way or arterial street, the plan
commission may require a street (on one or both sides of such right-of-way or
street) approximately parallel to and at a distance removed suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, i.e. park purposes, deep residential
lots with a planting or fence strip established along the rear property
lines, and off-street parking, business, or other uses as permitted by the
zoning regulations.



(Code 1965, § 32.08(e))



Sec. 98-102. Lot standards.



   (a)   Shape generally. In general, lots should be as nearly
rectangular in shape as practicable.



   (b)   Minimum area. Lots within the corporate limits of the village

within the corporate limits of the village and in the class R2 residential
zone shall have a minimum area of 8,100 square feet and be not less than 60
feet in width at the building line. All other provisions of the zoning
regulations of the village regarding all classes of zoning and land use shall
be adhered to.



   (c)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be increased in width by 25
percent over the width of typical interior lots except that corner lots need
not exceed 90 feet in width. The plan commission may make variations in
corner lots to encourage the proper development of intersection design and
traffic safety. On corner lots the building setback line on both streets
shall conform to the building setback line for the adjacent lots in both
directions.



   (d)   Lots in unincorporated areas. Lots in the unincorporated area
for a distance of 1 1/2 miles beyond the village limits shall conform to
applicable provisions of the county zone ordinance.



   (e)   Depth. Depth of lots shall be not less than 115 feet for
interior lots, and 110 feet for corner lots.

provide screening where a residential subdivision adjoins a railroad
right-of-way, an industrial or business area or similar nonresidential land
use.

ARTICLE V. IMPROVEMENTS



Sec. 98-131. Acceptance.



   If any plat of subdivision contains public streets, thoroughfares, or
easements which are dedicated thereon as such, whether located within the
corporate limits of the village or, in part, outside thereof, or contains
existing streets located outside of the corporate limits, the approval of the
plat by the board of trustees, or subsequent annexation of the property to
the village, shall not constitute an acceptance by the village of such
streets, thoroughfares, or easements; nor of the public improvements
constructed or installed thereon or therein irrespective of any acts by any
officer, agent or employee of the village with respect to such streets or
improvements. The acceptance of all public improvements shall be made only by
the adoption of a resolution by the board of trustees after there has been
filed with the village manager a certification by the village engineer
stating that all, or individual, public improvements required to be
constructed or installed have been fully, or individually, completed, and
that the inspected construction or installation thereof has been approved by
him. Such certification by the village engineer shall be made upon
satisfactory completion of all, or individual, public improvements
constructed and installed in accordance with applicable plans and
specifications. The subgrade, base course and surface course of a street,
thoroughfare, alley or parking area shall be collectively considered as a
single, or individual, public improvement. Acceptance of an individual public
improvement shall constitute release of the applicable portion of the
performance surety.



(Code 1965, § 32.10)



Sec. 98-132. Required land improvements.



   No final plat shall be approved by the plan commission until the
village engineer has certified that the plans and specifications for the
proposed public improvements meet the minimum requirements of the village,
county, state, and other authorities having jurisdiction, and that
improvements comply with the following regulations:



      (1)   Sewers and water supply. Regulations governing sewers
and water supply are as follows:



         a.   Sanitary sewer lines, including sewer stub
terminals to the property line of each lot, shall be installed to serve all
properties in the subdivision, except in subdivisions where underground
sewage disposal systems are permitted.



         b.   Storm sewers shall be designed to service the
entire subdivision to carry off water from all inlets and catchbasins, and be
connected with an adequate outfall. The stormwater drainage system shall be
separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system.



         c.   Water distribution facilities, including pipe
fittings, hydrants and water stub terminals to the property line of each lot,
etc., shall be installed to serve all properties within the subdivision.



      (2)   Increased facilities. Where storm sewer, sanitary sewer,
or water facilities are made larger than is immediately required to serve the
land described in the final plat, due to the necessity of serving adjacent
and presently vacant property as it shall be developed in the future by
others, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for such additional costs on the
following terms and conditions:



         a.   The village engineer shall determine the cost of
such storm sewer, sanitary sewer and/or water facilities as are required to
serve only the immediate needs of the property described in the plat. The
village engineer will also determine the cost of such facilities actually
required to serve the plat in question and the adjacent land when developed.



         b.   The difference in cost in the above determinations
shall be paid to the developer upon the development of the adjacent
properties. At the time the adjacent properties are submitted for
subdivision, the village engineer shall apportion the benefit received by the
adjacent property developer by reason of the increased facilities. The
adjacent property developer shall pay the village a sum of money equal to his
proportionate share of the cost of the increased facilities, plus a five
percent village charge for administrative handling expense. Upon receipt of
such proportionate share payment by the adjacent property developer, the
village shall reimburse the developer who originally installed the increased
facilities.



      (3)   Street grading. Street grading regulations are as
follows:



         a.   The full width of the public right- of-way shall be

10,400 square feet in area, the board of trustees at the recommendation of
the plan commission, may require sidewalks at selected locations. Sidewalks
at least five feet wide shall be installed in accordance with village
standards.



         f.   Street lighting shall be installed in accordance
with village standards to illuminate adequately all roadways and sidewalk
surfaces. The installation shall be completed within one year from completion

electric service to be installed shall be placed underground within easements
or dedicated public ways. The installation of such facilities shall be made

commerce commission now or hereafter effective, and the owner or subdivider
of any property to be served from such underground installation shall be
responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations, now and hereafter
effective and filed with such commission pursuant to the Illinois Public
Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.), of any public utility whose
services will be required with respect to the provision of such underground
facilities.



         b.   Where telephone, electric, and gas service lines
are placed underground entirely throughout a subdivision area, conduits or
cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner
which will not conflict with other underground services. Further, aboveground
structures identified with the underground facilities shall be located so as
not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.



         c.   All drainage and utility installations which
traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements.



      (7)   Use of existing streets. The village manager shall
designate the streets to be used for access to the subdivision by all
equipment and trucks engaged in the construction of all public improvements,
utility services and buildings.    (Code 1965, § 32.11)

Sec. 102-12. Installment Contracts.



   The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer
for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance.  The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing.  Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency.  If
the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day

the applicable period was filed or for the calendar in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later. 



   (b)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year
period for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by

limitations shall be six (6) years after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed. 



   (c)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer. 



Sec. 102-14. Voluntary Disclosure.



   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of tax due.  A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of the tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for
all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four (4)
years before the date of filing the application.  A taxpayer filing a valid
voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was
filed.  However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the
amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with
applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application
shall be deemed invalid and void.  The payment of tax and interest must be
made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary
disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator.  However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this Section must be
paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion
of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator, whichever is longer. 



Sec. 102-15. Publication of Tax Ordinances.



   Any newly adopted locally administered tax ordinance shall be published
via normal or standard publishing requirements.  The posting of a tax
ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy publication requirements.  Copies of
all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the
Village Clerk's office.



Sec. 102-16. Internal Review.



   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. 
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid,
the lien shall remain in full force and effect.  If the lien is determined
to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:



   (i)   timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;



   (ii)   correct the taxpayer's credit record; and



   (iii)   correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed
lien. 



Sec. 102-17.  Conflict.

supplement all of the Village tax ordinances.  To the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this ordinance, this
ordinance shall be controlling.

related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible, and provided further that if such charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.

electricity for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers,
preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the

the corporate authorities may require.



   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time
of making such return, pay to the Village the amount of tax herein imposed;
provided that in connection with any return, the taxpayer may, if he so
elects, report and pay an amount based upon his total billings of business
subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made (exclusive
of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments
based upon any differences between such billings, and the taxable gross
receipts.



   (G)   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which
was not due under the provisions of this section 102-107, whether as the
result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any tax due, or to become due, under this section 102-107
from the taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided that no amounts
erroneously paid more than three years prior to the filing of a claim
therefore shall be so credited.



   (H)   No action to recover any amount of tax due under the
provisions of this section 102-107 shall be commenced more than three years
after the due date of such amount.



   (I)   Any taxpayer who fails to make a return, or who makes a
fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of this
section 102-107 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 and in addition
shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due.

administrator. At the hearing, the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle may
contest the merits of the alleged violation. Hearings shall be recorded, and
the hearing officer shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by
subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing may be represented
by counsel at their expense. Violators shall be given no less than three

determination of the hearing office shall be final and subject to the
provisions of the Administrative Review Law as found in 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et

written statement of reasons in the form of a sworn affidavit, as to why they
contest the merits of the alleged violation. The second notice of violation,
as provided in section 106-58, shall advise nonresidents of this option. Any
written response by a nonresident must be received at the village hall
addressed to the village traffic compliance administrator no less than 48
hours prior to the time of the hearing at which the violation will be
considered. In making a decision concerning that alleged violation, the
hearing officer shall consider such affidavit.



   (c)   Any fine or penalty imposed by the hearing officer shall be
paid by cash or check to the village either at the time of hearing or within
72 hours thereafter. When a person cited who has not paid the fine for the
violation fails to appear at a hearing, the hearing officer shall make a
final determination of compliance violation liability at the third scheduled
hearing date.



Sec. 106-60. Final determination of violation.



   Upon a final determination of compliance violation liability and the
conclusion of judicial review procedures under this chapter, a notice of
final determination shall be sent. That notice shall state the amount of fine
and/or penalty, that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing the
village and shall contain warnings that failure to pay within the time
specified may result in the village's filing of a petition in the circuit
court to have the unpaid fine or penalty rendered a judgment. The notice
shall also state that failure to pay fines or penalties for ten or more
parking violations may result in the suspension of the person's drivers

red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an
intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation
of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code ("Code"), 625 ILCS 5/11-306,
or similar violation of the Village of Homewood Municipal Code ("Municipal

   Recorded images means images produced by the automated traffic law
enforcement system, which consist of either two or more photographs; two or
more microphotographs; two or more electronic images; or, a video recording
showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the

vehicle.



   Traffic Compliance Administrator means the person appointed as such
through section 106-57 who shall have power to adopt, distribute and process
automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this
article, collect money paid as fines and penalties, operate the automated
traffic law enforcement system, and make certified reports to the Secretary
of State as required by this article.



(MC-811, § 1, 10-28-08)



Sec. 106-72.  Violations.

Code.



(MC-811, § 1, 10-28-08)



Sec. 106-73.  Notice of violation.



   (a)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a
motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of section 106-72, the
village shall issue a written notice of violation to the registered owner or
lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S. mail within 30 days
after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the village of the identity of
the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90
days following the violation. The village shall only be required to notify a
lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an
affidavit and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the notice's issuance. If
the driver information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing
company/lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned
as undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address
recorded in a United States Post Office approved database of the owner or
lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class
mail postage prepaid.



   (b)   A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law
violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the
traffic compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine
whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of section 106-72,
or whether one of the defenses enumerated in section 106-77 is visibly
applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image
captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation
shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for
above. The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all
violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of
the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding
alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and
shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the
basis of the defenses established in this division.

statement that the payment of the fine shall operate as a final disposition
of the violation;



      (8)   A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by
the date noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against
the owner or lessee;



      (9)   The amount of the late fee;



      (10)   A statement that the failure to pay by the date
specified or to contest liability in a timely manner will result in a final
determination of liability and may result in the suspension of driving
privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle;



      (11)   A statement that the recorded images constitute prima
facie evidence of a violation;



      (12)   A statement that the person may elect to proceed by

division may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of
violation (21 days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or
set forth an applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute
evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any
proceeding alleging a violation of this section. The notice of violation
shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the
basis of the defenses established in this division.



   (b)   The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a
finding of liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "Findings,
Decision and Order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to
pay the amount by the date specified in that letter will result in a final
determination.

Sec. 106-78.  Final determination.



   A final determination of violation liability shall occur following
failure to pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing by the respond-by
date, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the
exhaustion of or failure to exhaust the administrative review procedures
provided by the Municipal Code. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing
to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior
mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination shall become final upon a
failure to pay the amount owed on the date provided in the "Findings,
Decision and Order" letter. Appeal may be made to the Circuit Court of Cook
County on any final determination as provided for by the Administrative
Review Act.



(MC-811, § 1, 10-28-08)



Sec. 106-79.  Notice of determination of liability.



   If the registered owner fails to pay or contest the notice of violation
within 21 days a notice of determination of liability will be sent to the
owner indicating that a fine in the amount of $100 is due to the village. 
The notice will also state that the owner can petition the village to set
aside the determination of liability before it becomes final.  If the owner
does not pay the $100 as specified in the notice or petition the village to
set aside the determination, within 21 days, a notice of final determination
will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has exhausted all
challenge options and the $100 fine is a debt due and owing to the village
and must be paid within 14 days. The owner will also be notified that the
failure to pay the $100 fine within 14 days will result in a late fee of $100
added to the original fine.



(MC-811, § 1, 10-28-08)

the village;



   (b)   A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the
village within 14 days may result in the village filing a petition in the
Circuit Court of Cook County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment,
or may result in the suspension of the person's drivers license for failure
to pay fines or penalties for five or more violations under this division.

      (3)   Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for
a hearing.



   (b)   Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the
determination of liability, the hearing officer shall review the petition to
determine if cause has been shown to set aside the determination. If cause
has been shown, the village shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date
on which the petitioner must appear to present his case. The village shall
notify the petitioner of the hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or
deny the petition within 14 days of the village's receipt.

and owing as a result of five automated traffic violations. The report shall
be certified and contain the following:



      (1)   The name, last known address as recorded with the

and driver's license number of the person who failed to pay the fine or
penalty and the registration number of any vehicle known to be registered to
such person in a state;

under this division is returned as undeliverable at the last known address
recorded at a United States Post Office approved database; the date on which
such notice was sent; and address to which such notice was sent.



   (b)   The traffic compliance administrator shall notify the

the previously recorded fine or penalty or whenever the municipality
determines that the original report was in error. A certified copy of such
notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to
the person named therein.



   (c)   Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that
their driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period
may challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the traffic
compliance administrator. The person shall, within seven days after having
received notice from the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak
with the traffic compliance administrator to challenge the accuracy of the
certified report. If the traffic compliance administrator determines that the
original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the
report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has
already paid their fine for the five or more automated traffic violations,
the traffic compliance administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary
of State of such error in a subsequent certified report.

   (b)   Towing without notice; immediate tows. Hazardous or unlawful
vehicles may be towed without prior notice, except that when an unlawful
vehicle is only one that has been reported as stolen and is not towable for

vehicle, if he so wishes, to avoid incurring the expenses of a police-ordered
tow; provided, however, that the vehicle may be towed if the owner permitted

Sec. 106-358. Pre-tow notice for abandoned vehicles.



   (a)   Notice pursuant to this section shall be personally delivered
to the owner or shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in
the most current registration list of the state secretary of state. The
notice shall be in the form provided in section 103-363. If an out-of-state
vehicle is proposed to be towed, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter
shall be made of the state secretary of state of the particular jurisdiction
for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the
owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided in this section
to the address furnished, though in no case will the village be required to
delay towing more than seven days after the date of the mailing or personal
delivery of the notice if no request for a hearing has been received within
that seven-day period.



   (b)   A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon
which the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the police
department shall be placed on the vehicle.



(Code 1965, § 50.03)



Sec. 106-359. Pre-tow hearing procedures.



   (a)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner or person entitled to
possession of a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven
days after the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request,
in writing, a pretow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the
vehicle may be towed, if the owner has not filed a written hearing request
within the seven-day period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of
this article will be deemed waived.



   (b)   Scheduling of pre-tow hearings. The pre-tow hearing shall be
scheduled for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of
the pre-tow notice. The village shall not be required to delay towing longer
than such a 14-day period.



   (c)   Request for pre-tow hearings. Requests for a pre-tow hearing
are to be made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for
hearing by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the village may be made
by mail. Forms for such requests shall be made available at the police
department. At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a
hearing date and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.



   (d)   Appointment of hearing officer. The village shall choose an
officer or employee of the village to serve as hearing officer. In no case
shall that hearing officer be an individual who was involved in the initial
decision to tow the vehicle. The hearing officer shall have the authority to
require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed
tow or any other village personnel.



   (e)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature,
and the rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be
determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After
receiving all relevant evidence, the hearing officer shall make a written
decision based upon a preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of
the vehicle is authorized by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the
village, with a specific statutory or ordinance section cited in the
decision. The owner shall be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.



   (f)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance
of the evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this
article, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any
towing and storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner. The fees to be
charged for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum
rates set by the chief of police pursuant to the provisions of section
106-360. The owner of the vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the
towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a
proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.



   (g)   Decision not to tow. If the preponderance of the evidence
fails to support towing of the vehicle, the hearing officer shall direct that
the vehicle shall not be towed. The village shall furnish a copy of such
decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location
plainly visible from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No
vehicle about which such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the
village unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered have
changed. If at some subsequent time the village should wish to tow the
vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required
for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.



   (h)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions.
Originals or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing
reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by
the police department for a period of at least five years after each hearing,
or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The village or the
owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided
by law.



(Code 1965, § 50.04)



Sec. 106-360. Post-tow notice for hazardous and unlawful vehicles.



   (a)   Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section
shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most current
registration list of the state secretary of state, unless the notice is
personally delivered to the owner, in which case the date and time of the
delivery and the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be
noted in the police department records or reports. The notice shall be in the
forms provided in sections 106-362(a) and 106-362(b), and shall be mailed or
delivered within 24 hours of the tow, as provided in section 106-357(b). If
the village has towed an out-of-state hazardous or unlawful vehicle, inquiry
by computer, telephone or letter shall be made to the state secretary of
state of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current
registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be
mailed as provided in this section to the address furnished.



   (b)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing
service operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions
of at least 12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures
for a hearing to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form
for which is set out in section 106-362(a) shall be placed in locations
readily visible to the public transacting business at any towing facility. If
a towing service operator performs services for more than one municipality,
the information for contacting the various appropriate municipal offices can
be listed in one such sign, the format for which shall be substantially
similar to the form set out in section 106-362(a).



   (c)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be
made in person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the
mailing or personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the
vehicle, whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be
deemed waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles
from the village may be made in person or by mail received by the village
within the 15-day period.



   (d)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled
to possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove vehicle,
the owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of
his identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a
receipt for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and
storage fees to the towing service operator. The police chief is authorized
to promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to
establish these facts.



   (e)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. The owner
shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on
police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be
administratively established by the chief of police and which may be revised
from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form
and sign concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in section
106-362(a). However, nothing in this article is intended to prevent a
competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established
maximum rates of police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum
rates for various services, the chief of police shall consider such matters
as the prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of
vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such as
large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and
amount of work required to perform various types of towing operations. For
particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious
accidents, the chief of police is authorized to allow towing operators to
charge rates above those established for normal situations, which special
charges must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account
such matters as the manhours and equipment time required for the job. A
towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a
billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and
supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and to the police department.
Any such special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in
the area for the nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing
service operator and the police department shall have available a copy of the
complete current rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the
chief of police for vehicle owners to view upon request.

   (a)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner of a vehicle towed as an
immediate tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the police department, as
set forth in this section, shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow
hearing to determine the validity of such tow and any towing or storage
charges. The hearing will not be determinative of or adjudicate any citation
issued relative to any towed vehicle.



   (b)   Nature of the hearing and hearing officer. The nature of the
hearing and the appointment of the hearing officer shall be the same as set
forth above in section 106-359(d) and section 106-359(e).



   (c)   Scheduling of post-tow hearings. Hearings shall take place as
follows:



      (1)   In those instances where the vehicle has been released
upon the deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage
charges, and the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall
take place within 15 days after the release of such vehicle, unless the owner
requests a later date convenient to all parties.



      (2)   In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded,
the hearing shall take place at the option of the owner:



         a.   On the next day after an owner's demand for such
hearing, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; if such demand is made
after 3:00 p.m., or if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence
creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next
calendar day, then a hearing shall be held on the second day following the
request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or



         b.   If acceptable to the owner, within 15 days of the
request on a date convenient to all parties.



   (d)   Conduct of post-tow hearing. The hearing officer shall review
all evidence presented by the vehicle owner and the police department or
other village employees, and shall make a finding based upon the
preponderance of the evidence presented, as to the lawful authority for the
towing and storage of the vehicle. The village must establish such authority
by a preponderance of the evidence.



   (e)   Post-tow hearing decision. For each hearing, the hearing
officer shall complete a post-tow hearing decision and attach such decision
to the police department's original vehicle towing report, and supply a copy
of the decision to the owner by personal delivery if the owner is present,
otherwise by mail. The decision and findings shall be substantially as stated
in the form for the posttow hearing decision, set forth in section 106-364.



   (f)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions.
All originals or copies of the notices, posttow hearing decisions, towing
reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by
the police department for a period of at least five years after each hearing,
or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The village or the
owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided
by law.



   (g)   Towing services subject to article. Notwithstanding any other
ordinance or statutory provision to the contrary, any towing service operator
authorized to perform tows on behalf of the village must perform its services
subject to the provisions of this article. However, the towing company shall
have the right to recover the reasonable value of its services for
police-ordered tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the
village; provided, however, that if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by
a court to be illegal and the towing service operator is required to return
the charge for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the village shall not be
liable to reimburse the operator for the towing charges.

difficult or unusual towing or storage circumstances, for which rate
information is available upon request at the police department or information
is available upon request at the police department or towing business
location. If the owner or person entitled to possession wishes to contest the
validity of the tow, he may obtain a hearing under the conditions of either
paragraph (A) or (B) stated below:



To Obtain Hearing



      (A)   If the vehicle has been released, he may, within 15 days
of the release of the vehicle or the mailing or personal delivery to him of
the notification of the tow, whichever occurs first, request a hearing by

waived unless a written request for hearing is received by the above office
within the applicable 15-day period.

The hearing shall be conducted according to municipal ordinance provisions,
and shall determine the validity of the impounding of the vehicle and the
imposition or refund of any towing or storage charges, but the hearing will
not determine or adjudicate any citations issued. If the hearing officer
sustains the validity of the tow and storage, the owner or person entitled to
possession will be required to pay all unpaid towing and storage fees before
obtaining the release of the vehicle.

determines that the registered owner is not liable for one or more of the
unpaid final determinations cited in the notice, the vehicle in question
shall not be immobilized, towed and impounded based upon the violations

interest. Whenever sewer bills become delinquent as provided in this section,
such bills shall become and constitute a lien upon the real estate to which
sewer service is supplied pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Illinois Municipal Code of 1961 (65 ILCS 5/11-141-7, 5/11-141-16). Property
owners shall be given notice in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-141-7 and
5/11-141-16. The claim for lien shall be made in the form of a sworn
statement setting out:



      (1)   A description of the real estate, sufficient for
identification thereof, upon or for which the sewer service was supplied;



      (2)   The amount of money due for such sewer service; and



      (3)   The date when such amount became delinquent.



   If all amounts shown due remain unpaid after recording as provided by
law, the village may foreclose such lien in like manner and with like effect
as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. In the alternative, the
village may, in its discretion, file suit to collect such amounts as are
delinquent and due against the occupant or user of the real estate in a civil
action, and shall collect, as well, all attorney's fees incurred by it, the
same to be fixed by order of the court. In addition to penalties and costs
attributable and chargeable to the recording of such notices of lien, the
user and owner shall be liable for interest upon all unpaid balances after
delinquency remaining from time to time unpaid at the rate of 12 percent per
annum.



   (e)   Delinquent charges; additional charges and expenses. In all
cases where the sewer service charge has become delinquent and the village
elects to file a statement of such delinquency in the office of the recorder
of deeds, there shall be added, in addition to the amount due the village,
such charges and expenses as are necessary and required to verify the legal
description of the property to which the lien is to attach, plus a sum
established by the village board as sufficient to cover the cost of
preparation of such notices and forms required. In each instance, the village
manager or a duly appointed employee of the village shall be authorized and
directed to include such additional costs in the amount claimed due the
village in the notice of lien.



   (f)   Revocation of permit; disconnection of service. The village
reserves the right to revoke discharge permits and disconnect service to any
user whenever bills become delinquent, as provided in this division.



   (g)   Payment in full prior to reconnection; new deposit. All
amounts charged under this division are due and shall continue to be due
hereunder, whether or not the sewer is disconnected, and no sewer shall be
reconnected until the village is paid in full for all amounts due it, and, in
addition, there shall be paid the village a deposit equal to the estimated
charge for the next succeeding year. Such deposit shall be held by the
village in escrow, and will be returned upon satisfactory payment of bills
for a period of two years.



   (h)   Annual notification of rate and portion of charges for
wastewater treatment. Each user will be notified at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment services.



   (i)   Access to records. All United States Environmental Protection
Agency and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency employees with proper
credentials, or their assigns, shall have access to records including
financial records pertinent to this user charge upon reasonable notification
to the village.

licenses for and regularly operate the minimum number of taxicabs required
for a period of 30 consecutive days, such license shall be considered
abandoned and automatically revoked and shall not be reinstated except under
the procedures required for obtaining new licenses. Regular operation shall

taxicab licenses.



   (a)   The total number of class 1 taxicab business licenses issued
in the village shall be one. The president and board of trustees may by
ordinance increase this number, provided an investigation by the board of
trustees indicates the change is necessary to the public's welfare and meets
the public's demands for such service. Class 1 taxicab business
licenseholders shall be required to have at least four taxicabs licensed by
the village at all times.



   (b)   The total number of class 2 taxicab business licenses issued

Sec. 118-67. Insurance.



   (a)   The licensee shall file with the village a policy of insurance
issued by a company authorized to do business in the state and insuring the
licensee and owner of such vehicle against liability for any damage or injury
to, including death of any person and for damage or injury to property
resulting from the negligence of such licensee, owner or his agent in the
operation of such vehicle. Such policy of insurance may cover one or more
vehicles, but all vehicles operating under the same business license must be
so insured. The limits of liability shall, with respect to each vehicle
covered by such policy, be not less than $250,000.00 for each person and
$350,000.00 for each accident, and for property damage in the amount of
$100,000.00. Such policy of insurance shall provide for the payment and
satisfaction of any final judgment rendered against the licensee or owner of
such vehicle for damage to property or for personal injury, including death.
The policy shall be further endorsed to require 30 days' written notice of
cancellation to the village.



   (b)   If the village receives a notice of cancellation pursuant to
such endorsement, the taxicab business license and all taxicab vehicle
licenses issued pursuant to the terms of this section, shall immediately
terminate as of the effective date of such insurance termination unless the
taxicab business licensee provides a substitute policy of insurance complying
with the provisions of this section.



   (c)   In case a final judgment or claim has been paid by any
indemnitor or insurance policy on behalf of a taxicab business licensee, as a
result of which the original amount of coverage required in this section is
proportionately reduced, the business license and all taxicab vehicle
licenses issued pursuant to the authority granted by this article to that
licensee shall be immediately terminated subject to reinstatement, within 30
days, by replacement of coverage so having demised.



   (d)   The village manager may revoke any taxicab license if any
vehicle so licensed is found to be uninsured according to the terms of this
section.

first secured a valid state driver's license or equivalent and a village
taxicab driver's license. The annual license period shall extend from January
1 to December 31.



   (b)    Fee. The annual fee for a taxicab driver's license shall be
$5.00. Such fee shall not be prorated for a partial year's license, and no
license shall be transferable. No such license shall be automatically renewed.



   (c)   Certificate of fitness. No person shall operate any taxicab in
the village nor be licensed by the village clerk therefor who has not first
applied for and received from the chief of police (or his designee) a
certificate of fitness to drive a public passenger vehicle. Such certificate
shall be issued by the chief of police (or his designee) to any person who
possesses a valid state driver's license or equivalent except as hereinafter
provided.



   (d)   Application. Any person desiring to secure a taxicab driver's
certificate shall make application in writing to the chief of police on a

with his present employer, and information as to previous employment.



   (e)   Issuance of certificate. No certificate shall be issued by the
chief of police (or his designee) to any person who has been convicted of a
class X felony; provided, however, that upon the written recommendation of
the chief of police, the president of the village, and the village manager,
such certificate may be granted upon consideration of the nature of the
felony, time elapsed since conviction, subsequent criminal convictions, if
any, previous employment record, and any evidence of rehabilitation submitted
by the applicant. Any such certificate may be revoked as provided in section
118-65(c).



   (f)   Display of certificate. A taxicab driver shall either wear on
his person in plain view or display in the taxicab in plain view of
passengers his taxicab driver's certificate.

This ordinance is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or other private agreement except that where the regulations of this ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of this ordinance shall govern.
1.5 Transition Rules
A. Building Permits Issued Prior to Effective Date
When a building permit has been lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance and construction has begun within six (6) months of the date of issue and is being diligently pursued to completion, the building or structure may be complete and a certificate of occupancy may be issued in accordance with the plans for which the building permit was issued.
B. Pending Applications
Where an application for a special use, variation or PUD is pending on the effective date of this ordinance, or subsequently filed, the provisions of this ordinance shall govern such application.
C. Existing Special Uses, Variations and PUDs
All variations, PUDs and special uses granted by the Board of Trustees prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.

Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-14 Zoning Ordinance
2.16 Special Uses
A. Purpose
The Zoning Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into districts, within which the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures are essentially uniform. However, there are special uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the particular use at the particular location. The special use process addresses these unique circumstances and regulates such uses to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such special uses fall into two categories:
1. Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-related utilities or uses traditionally maintained for the public interest.
2. Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
B. Initiation of Application
Any owner of, or any person having a right of ownership in, any property in the Village of Homewood may petition for a special use. A petition for a special use shall be filed initially with the Director of Economic and Community Development. The application shall be filed in accordance with the requirements in Section 2.8.
C. Processing
Petitions for special uses are heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission, which shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.9, with notice given in accordance with Section 2.10. In the case of two (2) unexcused absences by the applicant, the request shall be dismissed without prejudice. Within thirty (30) days of the hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its findings of fact and its recommendation to approve, to approve with conditions, or to deny the special use to the Village Board.
The Village Board shall make the final decision on all special uses. Upon receiving the report from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Village Board may approve the special use, approve it with conditions, deny the special use or refer the special use back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration.
D. Records
A record of all requests for special uses and Village action taken shall be kept on file in the Office of Director of Economic and Community Development. Subject to the exceptions in the Freedom of Information Act, copies shall be available on request to any person for a fee.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-15 Zoning Ordinance
E. Standards
No special use shall be granted by the Village Board unless the special use:
1. Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location.
2. Is not detrimental to the economic welfare of the community.
3. Will be consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
4. Is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated, that the public health, safety, and welfare will be protected.
5. Is a suitable use of the property and, without the special use, the property will be substantially diminished in value.
6. Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is located.
7. Will be consistent with the uses and community character of the neighborhood surrounding the parcel.
8. Will not be injurious to the use or enjoyment of other property in the neighborhood for the purposes permitted in the zoning district.
9. Will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties for uses permitted in the zoning district.
10. Provides adequate measures of ingress and egress in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion in the public streets.
11. Is served by adequate utilities, drainage, road access, public safety and other necessary facilities.
12. Will not substantially adversely affect one (1) or more historical, archeological, cultural, natural or scenic resources located on the parcel or surrounding properties.
No one of the above standards is controlling.
F. Conditions
The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Village Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of a special use. Such conditions must be deemed necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section, to promote the general objectives of this ordinance, and to minimize or reduce the injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of such special use approval.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-16 Zoning Ordinance
G. No Presumption of Approval
The listing of a use as a special use within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such special use will be approved. Rather each proposed special use shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to the standards in this section, the standards in Section 9 and the standards for the district in which it is located. Such evaluation will determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed.
H. Limitation on Special Uses
1. Special use approval may become null and void unless a building permit is issued within one (1) year of the date of adoption of the ordinance granting special use approval and a certificate of occupancy is issued within two (2) years of the date of adoption of such ordinance. After notice to the property owner and an opportunity for a hearing, the Village Board may terminate the special use. However, the Village Board may extend these periods, upon written request from the applicant showing good cause.
2. Special use approval is granted to a specific property and authorizes the conduct of the special use only on the property represented on the application and is not transferable to other properties.
3. The approval of a special use authorizes the use on the property in the manner proposed, but does not in itself authorize the establishment of such use without first obtaining any other required approvals, including a building permit and certificate of occupancy.
4. Any modification or intensification of a special use that alters the essential character or operation of the use in a way not approved at the time the special use was granted, as evidenced by the record or by the text of this ordinance, shall require new special use approval in accordance with this section.
I. Findings of Fact
Every special use decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact specifying the reason or reasons for granting or denying the special use.
2.17 Variances
A. Purpose
The variance process is designed to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this ordinance that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. The three types of variances are:

e. To increase, by not more than 25%, the maximum distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served.
f. To allow any permitted non-residential use in a residential district to exceed the floor area ratio imposed by the applicable regulations by no more than 10% of that area limit imposed by applicable regulations.
g. To allow a private garage in a residence district to exceed the limitations of Section 8, provided that the applicant testifies and the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that the proposed garage will be used only for lawful purposes.
h. To allow a reduction of not more than five (5) feet in the required setback provisions for outdoor private residential swimming pools in accordance with Chapter 22-62 of the Municipal Code.
i. To allow the modification of height restrictions for fences in accordance with Section 22-95E of the Municipal Code.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-18 Zoning Ordinance
3. Minor Variance
In certain limited circumstances, practical difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations imposed by this ordinance may, as hereinafter provided, be administratively varied by the Director of Economic and Community Development. He shall decide such petitions in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance and in accordance with the procedures set forth by the Statutes of the State of Illinois and this ordinance.

a. To permit a yard up to 5% less than the yard required by the applicable regulations.
b. To permit the use of a lot for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient area of the lot, but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than 95% of the required lot area.
c. To modify the applicable off-street parking or loading requirements to the extent of not more than one (1) parking space or loading berth, or 5% of the spaces required by applicable regulations, whichever number is greater.
d. To allow any permitted non-residential use in a residential district to exceed the floor area ratio imposed by the applicable regulations by no more than 5% of that area limit imposed by applicable regulations.
e. To permit the direct replacement of a concrete stoop and stairs that encroaches into the required front or side yard with a wood structure of the same dimensions.
f. To permit an accessory structure to be located less than ten (10) feet but not less than five (5) feet from the principal structure, provided the accessory structure is constructed with no less than a one (1)-hour fire resistance rating.
The Director of Economic and Community Development may decide the above type of cases, but may refer any such case to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a hearing and a decision. The granting of the variance by the Director of Economic and Community Development confers the same rights and responsibilities on the owner as the granting of a variance by the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the Director of Economic and Community Development denies the variance, the applicant may request that the Planning and Zoning Commission hear and decide the case.
B. Initiation of Application
Any owner of, or any person having a right of ownership in, any property in the Village of Homewood may request a variation. A petition for a variation shall be filed initially with the Director of Economic and Community Development. The application shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.21.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-19 Zoning Ordinance
C. Processing
All petitions for a variation, except those enumerated in Section 2.17(A)(3), are heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission, which shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.9, with notice given in accordance with Section 2.10. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make the final decision on all administrative variances, except certain garage variances specified in Section 2.17(J). In the case of two (2) unexcused absences by the applicant, the request for the variance shall be dismissed without prejudice. Within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing for a zoning variance and certain garage variances specified in Section 2.17(J), the Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its findings of fact and its recommendation to approve, to approve with conditions, or to deny the variation to the Village Board. The Village Board shall make the final decision on all zoning variances and certain garage variances specified in Section 2.17(J). Upon receiving the report from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Village Board may approve the variation, with or without conditions, by adoption of an ordinance or may deny the variation. All ordinances granting variations, with or without conditions, shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County, Illinois.
D. Records
A record of requests for variations and action taken, whether by the Director of Economic and Community Development, the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the Village Board shall be kept on file in the Office of Economic and Community Development. Subject to exceptions in the Freedom of Information Act, copies shall be available on request to any person for a fee.
E. Standards
No zoning variance shall be granted as authorized in this section unless findings based upon the evidence presented in each specific case establish that the standards 1, 2, and 3 enumerated below are met:
1. That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located.
2. That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances.
3. That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Planning and Zoning Commission, in making this determination, whenever there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, shall also take into consideration the extent to which items 4 through 9 below have been established by the evidence:
4. That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions, or the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-20 Zoning Ordinance
5. That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning classification.
6. That the alleged difficulty or hardship and/or the alleged unique circumstance, has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property.
7. That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
8. That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
9. That the proposed variation will help to achieve the purposes enumerated for planned unit developments in Section 10, if the variation is requested as part of an application for planned unit development approval.
No one of the above standards is controlling.
F. Conditions
The Director of Economic and Community Development, in the case of minor variances listed in Section 2.17(A)(3), the Planning and Zoning Commission, in the case of administrative variances listed in Section 2.17(A)(2), and the Village Board, in the case of zoning variances as in Section 2.17(A)(1), may require such conditions and limitations upon the use, construction, location, and character on any lot benefited by a variation. Such conditions must be deemed necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section, to promote the general objectives of this ordinance, and to minimize or reduce the injurious effect on other property in the neighborhood. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the zoning variation or in the minutes of the hearing when the Planning and Zoning Commission granted the administrative variation. Violation of any such conditions or limitations as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variation.
G. Variation Less than Requested
The Director of Economic and Community Development, in the case of minor variations listed in Section 2.17(A)(3), the Planning and Zoning Commission, in the case of administrative variances listed in 2.17(A)(2), and the Village Board, in the case of zoning variances as in Section 2.17(A)(1), may grant variations less than or different from the relief requested when the record supports the applicant’s right to some relief but not to the entire relief as requested.
H. Limitations on Variations
1. An approved variation may become null and void unless a building permit is issued within six (6) months of the date the variation was granted and a certificate of occupancy is issued within one (1) year of the date the variation was granted. After notice giving the property owner an opportunity for a hearing, the Village Board may terminate the variation or the Village Board may extend these periods, upon written request from the applicant showing good cause.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-21 Zoning Ordinance
2. An approved variation is granted to a specific property, authorizes the variation only on the property represented on the application, and is not transferable to other properties.
3. An approved variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or development for which it was issued. The approval of a variation does not in itself authorize the establishment of any use, nor construction, alteration or development, without first obtaining any other required approvals, including a building permit and certificate of occupancy.
4. Any construction, alteration or development that is beyond the scope so authorized shall require approval of a new variation in accordance with this section.
I. Findings of Fact
Every decision on a variation, made by the Village Board, the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Director of Economic and Community Development shall be accompanied by findings of fact specifying the reason or reasons for granting or denying the variation.
J. Garage Variances
An application for an oversized garage variance or variance to construct a second garage on a residential lot shall be filed and processed in the manner prescribed for administrative variances. However, in the case of garage variances, after a public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make a recommendation to the Village Board and the Village Board shall either grant or deny such application. The property owner and all future owners of property, which is the site of an approved oversized garage or second garage, shall comply with all of the terms and conditions of the ordinance granting such approval. The fee for an oversized garage application or a second garage application shall be the same as required for an administrative variance application. Petitioners shall file a copy of their title insurance policy with each such application.
1. Where there is an existing garage on a residential lot, a property owner may petition for a variation to allow the construction of a second garage on such lot. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear such petitions and shall make a recommendation to the Village Board. No such petition shall be granted unless findings, based upon the evidence presented in each specific case, establish that the standards in Section 2.17(E) have been met and establish:
a. That either the existing garage or the proposed second garage shall be attached to the residential building on a lot containing a minimum of ten-thousand and four-hundred (10,400) square feet
b. That the proposed garage conforms to the Village Building Code and all zoning ordinance requirements, including yard setbacks, height and size.
c. That the proposed garage and the existing garage will be used only for purposes incidental to a lawful residential use.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 2-22 Zoning Ordinance
2. Where there is an existing carport on a residential lot, a property owner may petition for a variation to allow the construction of a separate garage on such lot. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear the petition and shall make a recommendation to the Village Board. No such petition shall be granted unless findings, based upon the evidence presented in each specific case, establish that the standards in Section 2.17(E) have been met and establish:
a. That the existing carport cannot be removed because it is part of the roofline of the existing single-family residence.
b. That the proposed garage conforms to the Village Building Code and all other zoning ordinance requirements including yard setbacks, height and size.
c. That the proposed garage and the existing carport will be used only for lawful purposes incidental to a residential use.
3. A request for a variance to replace a nonconforming fence existing prior to December 9, 1997 must meet the variance standards. In addition, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the following factors:
a. The extent to which fences of the same type sought by the applicant already exist in the immediate area.
b. The type of street to which the fence will be oriented, and the volume and speed of traffic using the street.
c. The extent to which the fence will use landscaping to minimize the visual impact of the fence.
2.18 Appeals
A. Scope of Appeals
An appeal may be taken to the Planning and Zoning Commission by any person, firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board or bureau or commission, aggrieved by a decision of the Building Inspector, Director of Economic and Community Development or other authorized officials. The appeal process provides checks and balances on administrative authority.

The request for an interpretation shall set forth the facts and circumstances, a description of the proposed development, and the precise interpretation claimed by the applicant to be correct.
C. Content of Letter
The interpretation does not itself authorize the establishment of a use but provides guidance for any approvals or permits required by this ordinance, and the interpretation shall be advisory in nature and shall not be binding upon the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Village Board in their functions under this ordinance. The interpretation shall specify the facts, reasons, analysis and standards upon which the interpretation is based.
D. Records
A record of all zoning interpretations shall be kept on file in the Director of Economic and Community Development's office.

Village of Homewood, Illinois 3-1 Zoning Ordinance
SECTION 3 - ZONING DISTRICTS
3.1 Establishment of Zoning Districts
In order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Section, the Village shall be divided into the following districts:
Residential Districts
R-1 Single-Family Residence District
R-2 Single-Family Residence District
R-3 Townhouse/Transition District
R-4 Multiple Family Residence District
Business Districts
B-1 Central Business District
B-2 Community Business District
B-3 Service Business District
B-4 Shopping Center District
DO Downtown Overlay District
Manufacturing Districts
M-1 Limited Manufacturing District
M-2 Heavy Manufacturing District
Special District
PL Public Land and Open Space District
3.2 Interpretation of District Sequence
A. General Rule
This ordinance rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts. Except as noted below, this ordinance is based on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific purpose, to encourage a particular type of development and to protect that development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of development.
B. Special Rule
Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that when different districts are adjoining, their differing characters may require special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this ordinance recognizes the concept of “more restrictive” and “less restrictive” districts. The districts established by this ordinance shall be considered “more restrictive” or “less restrictive” in accordance with the following rules:
Village of Homewood, Illinois 3-2 Zoning Ordinance
1. The residential districts shall be deemed more restrictive than any non-residential district.
2. The R1 Single Family Residence District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive residential district and the R4 Multiple Family Residence District shall be deemed to be the least restrictive residential district.
3. The Public Lands District shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any business district but less restrictive than any residential district.
4. The M Manufacturing Districts shall be deemed less restrictive than any other zoning district. The M-1 Limited Manufacturing shall be deemed to be the most restrictive manufacturing district.
3.3 Interpretation of Boundaries
The Zoning Map shall be drawn to scale so that close approximations to dimensions of zoning districts can be ascertained. When uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts, the following rules shall apply:
A. Unless otherwise indicated, district boundary lines are either the centerlines of railroads, highways, streets, alleys, tract or lot lines, or such lines extended.
B. When a district boundary line divides a lot of record in single ownership, the use authorized on, and the district requirements applying to, the most restricted portion of the lot shall be considered as applying to the entire lot.
C. When the district boundary lines do not coincide with a right-of-way line or lot line, the district boundary shall be determined by applying the map scale and measuring the boundary line.
The Director of Economic and Community Development shall hear and decide all interpretations of any district boundary lines as shown on the Zoning Map. The Director Economic and Community Development shall have the authority to interpret such boundary lines, but does not have the authority to amend those lines, which shall be done in accordance with the procedures in Section 2.15.
3.4 Zoning Map
A. Map Incorporated
The location and boundaries of the districts established by this ordinance are set forth in the Zoning Map, which is incorporated into, and made an integral part of, this ordinance. All notations, references and amendments thereto shall be as much a part of this ordinance as if specifically set forth and literally described herein.
B. Omitted Land
It is the intent of this ordinance that the entire area of the Village, including all land and water areas, be included in the districts established by this ordinance. Any land lying within the Village, but not shown on the Zoning Map as being included within a district, shall be deemed to be classified as within the R1 Single Family Residence District
Village of Homewood, Illinois 3-3 Zoning Ordinance
C. Maintenance of Official Zoning Map
The Zoning Map shall be prepared by, and filed with, the Director of Economic and Community Development and shall be available for public reference during normal business hours. The Zoning Map shall be updated annually as is required by state law. Any amendment to zoning district boundaries shall be indicated on the Zoning Map.
D. Availability of Zoning Map
A revised, current copy of the Zoning Map, certified as being inclusive of all amendments and drawn to a convenient scale, shall be published from time to time and made available for sale. However, it shall be the responsibility of those obtaining zoning maps to verify the current status of the map with the Director of Community Development.
3.5 Annexed Land
All territory which may be annexed to the Village after the effective date of this ordinance shall be classified into the R-1 Single-Family Residence District, unless otherwise provided in the annexation agreement or until changed in accordance with the procedures established in Section 2.15.
3.6 Exemptions for Public Utilities
Subject to compliance with the Municipal Code and all other regulations, the following essential services are permitted to be erected, constructed, altered or maintained in any district:
A. Traffic signals, fire hydrants and similar equipment and accessories.
B. Gas, electric, communication, water supply, and transmission/distribution systems.
C. Elevated, grade level, or underground water storage tanks and water towers.
D. Storm and sanitary sewer collection and disposal systems.
Poles, wires, mains, drains, pipes, conduits and cables reasonably necessary for the furnishing of adequate service by public utilities, municipal or other governmental agencies or for the public health, safety and welfare.
However, the exemption in this Section shall not apply to any buildings or to any services regulated in Section 9.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 4-1 Zoning Ordinance
SECTION 4 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
4.1 Purposes of the Residential Districts
The purpose of the R1 Single-Family Residence District is to protect and maintain single-family detached residential development and limited other public and institutional uses compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The standards are intended to preserve the low-density characteristic of the current development pattern, which consists of relatively large lots.
The purpose of the R2 Single-Family Residence District is to protect and maintain detached single-family residential development and limited other public and institutional uses compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The standards are intended to maintain the relatively low-density characteristic of the current development pattern.
The purpose of the R3 Townhouse/Transition District is to promote and maintain the development of single-family attached residential development and to allow limited commercial uses appropriate to the residential context of the area. The standards are intended to provide a mix of uses and to encourage alternative forms of housing at low-rise densities that buffer the surrounding single-family neighborhoods from the more intense land uses in the Central Business District.
The purpose of the R4 Multiple Family Residence District is to promote and maintain the development of multiple-family dwelling units, attached single-family dwelling units, and limited other public and institutional uses that are compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The standards are intended to provide for convenient living at higher densities characteristic of mid-rise buildings.

SECTION 5 - BUSINESS DISTRICTS
5.1 Purposes of the Business Districts
The purpose of the B1 Central Business District is to allow commercial uses that provide goods and services to the Village as a whole. The district provides for a mix of commercial, residential and entertainment uses. The standards are designed to maintain the pedestrian-oriented environment while accommodating larger scale uses.
The purpose of the B2 Community Business District is to protect and maintain the scale of commercial areas that provide goods and services primarily for the convenience of the surrounding neighborhoods. The standards are designed to promote the continuation of small-scale commercial districts.
The purpose of the B3 Service Business District is to provide for higher volume and higher intensity of commercial uses. Since these uses may affect the overall character of the Village, the standards are designed to maintain and enhance the appearance of major thoroughfares.
The purpose of the B4 Shopping Center District is to provide retail uses that serve the residents of the Village and the surrounding areas. The district allows for medium-scale development that generates a significant amount of traffic. The standards provide flexibility in the mix and scale of uses.

A. Off-Street Parking
The purpose of adjusted parking regulations in the DO District is to allow land uses to deviate from the parking requirements of Section 11 (Parking and Loading) to encourage transit-oriented development. This deviation is allowed in recognition of the unique characteristics of the downtown area such as: mixed uses, pedestrian-oriented developments, and availability of transit. The regulations of the DO District will allow a reduction in the number of required parking spaces and may permit the use of off-site parking facilities.
1. Number of Spaces Required

2. the respective hours or uses of the operation do not substantially overlap.
3. a legal agreement has been provided to the Village guaranteeing that the parking spaces and loading spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses are in existence unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with this Section. The agreement must be recorded in a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney.
b. Publicly owned parking within 300 feet of the subject parking may be included as part of the required parking. The number of spaces used to satisfy the required off-street parking for an individual use shall not exceed 25 percent of the required spaces for that use.

10.3 Procedure
A. Pre-Application Meeting
Prior to the filing of an application for approval of a PUD, the developer may request an informal meeting from the Planning and Zoning Commission to discuss any future project request. Such meeting shall be open to the public and included in the agenda in advance of the meeting. Recommendations or opinions of the Planning and Zoning Commission at these informal meetings are purely advisory and are not binding. This pre-application meeting is not mandatory and does not require formal application, fee or filing of a plat.
B. Submittals
A preliminary plat and drawings of the PUD shall be submitted to the Director of Economic and Community Development at least twenty-one (21) days before the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which the request is to be discussed. At that time, the Director of Economic and Community Development shall open a master file. The required submittals and fees are listed in Appendix A and B.
C. Preliminary Plat
The procedure for the PUD begins with a review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the preliminary plat and the supporting data for conformity to PUD regulations and shall begin the public hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend in writing to the
Village of Homewood, Illinois 10-3 Zoning Ordinance
Village Board, either approval, modification or denial of the preliminary plat. The recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be included in the minutes of their meetings. The recommendations shall state:
1. The extent to which the proposed plan meets the stated purpose of the planned unit development.
2. The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the property and whether the departures are in the public interest.
3. The extent to which the proposed plan produces a public benefit in terms of physical development, tax base, compatibility with the neighborhood and compliance with the planning objectives of the Village.
4. The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and standards of the planned unit development regulations and the Comprehensive Plan.
The Village Board, after receipt of the preliminary recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall approve, modify or deny the preliminary plat. The Village Board may require such special conditions as are deemed necessary to ensure conformance with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and the stated purposes of the planned unit development.
Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the petition or the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted with the preliminary plat. Unless the applicant fails to meet time schedules for submitting the final plat, or fails to proceed with development in accordance with the approved plans, or fails to comply with any conditions of this ordinance or the Municipal Code, the Village shall not, without the consent of the applicant, take any action to modify or revoke an approved preliminary plat, pending the application for final plat approval.
D. Final Plat
The preliminary and final plat may be filed and approved simultaneously, or the final plat may be filed and approved without a preliminary plat, if all of the land is to be developed at one time and if all requirements are met. In the case of a final PUD plat that does not conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, such final plat shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration. However, the Director of Economic and Community Development can approve minor changes to the final plat as provided in Section 10.8.
All final plats must be submitted for approval in accordance with agreed to scheduling, but not later than one (1) year from the approval of the preliminary plat. However, if desired by the developer, the final plat may be submitted in stages, with each stage reflecting the approved preliminary plat which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 10-4 Zoning Ordinance
To obtain approval of the final plat, a final planned unit development plat and other supporting data required for approval shall be submitted to the Director of Economic and Community Development. Final plats and supporting data shall show, in detail, the design, location and use of all buildings and overall land development, as well as such additional information as the Village may require. The Director of Economic and Community Development, after inspection of the final plat to ensure its conformity with these regulations and the preliminary plat, shall forward the final plat to the Village Board for final action. If the final plat is substantially in conformance with the preliminary plat and complies with all provisions of this Section, this ordinance and the Municipal Code, the Village Board shall approve the final plat.
Where the Village Board finds that the final plat does not comply with all provisions of this Section, this ordinance and the Municipal Code, the Village Board may refer the final plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration or it may deny the final plat. The Village Board may approve the final plat, with or without conditions, provided that no such conditions impair the rights granted by the preliminary plat approval, unless in the judgment of the Village Board any such condition is required by a change of circumstance from the time of approval of the preliminary plat.
E. Recording the Final Plat
Prior to the recording of the final plat, all delinquent taxes and all special assessments constituting a lien on the whole or any part of the property of the planned unit development shall have been paid. The ordinance authorizing the construction of the planned unit development shall be effective only upon the recording of the final planned unit development and the ordinance with the Reorder of Deeds.
The recorded final plat shall inform any persons dealing with the planned unit development of the restrictions placed upon the land and shall act as a zoning control device. No permit, allowing construction of a building or other development, shall be granted until the required recording of the final plat.
The purpose of the final plat is to designate with particularity, the land subdivided into conventional lots, as well as the division of other lands not so subdivided, into common open areas and building sites.

After approval of the final plat, no use or development, other than home-based businesses and temporary uses, shall be permitted except such uses and development specified in the final plat. After completion of a PUD, the uses and development specified in the final plat may be amended in the manner as provided in the following Section.
The Director of Economic and Community Development may approve minor changes in the planned unit development, that do not change the concept or intent of the development and that are the minimum changes necessary to overcome a particular difficulty and which do not violate any other requirements of this ordinance. Minor changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the type of landscaping elements, altering the grade by less than 20% and changes of no more than twenty-five (25) feet in the location of a structure, lot, street, sidewalk or open space. In addition to the above, any changes to the PUD, which are not described as amendments in Section 10.9, shall be deemed minor changes. Major changes shall be required to go to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
10.9 Amendments
Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned unit development including, but not limited to, increase in density, increases in the height of buildings, reductions of proposed open space, changes in the development schedule, changes in road standards, or other major changes, constitute amendments to the final plat. The Board of Trustees may grant approval for an amendment without a hearing upon finding that any proposed changes will be in substantial conformity with the final plat.
If the Board of Trustees determines that an amendment is not in substantial conformity with the final plat, the amendment may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plat and supporting data, and by following the preliminary approval steps and subsequent approval of the final plat and ordinance. All changes to the final plat shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds as amendments to the final plat or recorded with the Recorder of Deeds as a new final plat.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 10-9 Zoning Ordinance
10.10 Time Limitation
A. Completion Guarantee
A deposit shall be made to the Village in a letter of credit in a form approved by the Village Attorney. This deposit shall be a guarantee of satisfactory construction of the public facilities to be built in conjunction with the planned unit development. The escrow agreement shall be in a form approved by the Village Attorney. All public type utilities on private properties shall follow Village regulations concerning inspections and maintenance. All public facilities and improvements made necessary as a result of the planned unit development shall either be constructed in advance of the approval of the final plat or provided for by a letter of credit in a form approved by the Village Attorney.
B. Commencement of Construction
If the building construction has not begun within one (1) year from the passage of the ordinance, the ordinance may become null and void. After notice to the developer and the opportunity of a hearing before the Village Board, the Village Board may terminate the PUD or the Village Board may extend the one (1) year period at any time if it finds that facts in a written request from the developer show good cause for the extension.
C. Compliance with PUD Approval
If the actual development fails to comply with the final plat, the Village may issue an order stopping any and all work on the PUD until the noncompliance is cured. The applicant shall either take such steps necessary to comply with the final plat or seek an amendment to the final plat as provided in this Section. If the applicant fails to do either, or if the Village Board denies the amendment, the Village Board may revoke the final plat approval and all building permits based on such approval and take such other action as may be appropriate to abate the violation.
D. Phased Development
The Planning and Zoning Commission may designate divisible geographic sections of the entire parcel to be developed as an entity and shall, in such case, specify reasonable periods within which development of each such geographic section must be commenced. The time period established for the completion of the entire development and the commencement date for each geographic section thereof may be modified from time to time by the Village Board upon showing of good cause by the developer.
In the case of a planned unit development that contains residential buildings, the Planning and Zoning Commission may permit, within each geographic section of the PUD, deviations from the number of dwelling units per acre. However, such deviation shall be adjusted for in other areas of the geographic section so that, in the geographic section as a whole, the total number of dwelling units per acre is not exceeded.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-1 Zoning Ordinance
SECTION 11 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
11.1 General Provisions
Off-street parking is permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts, provided that it complies with this Section. Off-street parking as a principal use is permitted only when expressly authorized by the regulations of the applicable zoning district.
1. No Reduction of Required Spaces
Any off-street parking or loading space required in connection with buildings or structures existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be removed, except in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance. Any building or structure that is erected or substantially altered after the effective date of this ordinance shall provide off-street parking and loading spaces in accordance with this Section.
2. Provision of Additional Spaces
Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities, provided that such facilities meet the requirements of this ordinance governing the location, design and operation of such facilities.
3. Limitations on Use of Parking and Loading Spaces
No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall be permitted in any parking space, parking lot or loading berth. The repair, maintenance, detailing or storage of motor vehicles conducted as a business or commercial activity is prohibited in all residential districts.
4. Change in Land Use
Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new type of use, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new type of use. For those buildings and structures erected prior to the effective date of this ordinance, additional parking and loading facilities shall be provided only in the amount by which the requirements for the new type of use exceed the requirement for the existing type of use.
5. Change in Intensity of Use
When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities shall be provided for such increase in density. If, however, additional parking or loading facilities cannot be added in part or in whole due to a lack of available land area, a property owner may request a variance of this provision. The Village Board shall consider each variance request as it relates to the standards in Section 2.17.
6. Buildings Erected Prior to the Effective Date of this Ordinance
This Article shall not be construed to require the addition of any parking or loading spaces for uses in buildings or structures existing on the effective date of this ordinance. When a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance and construction
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-2 Zoning Ordinance
has begun within one (1) year and has been diligently pursued, parking and loading facilities shall be provided in the number of spaces required for the issuance of the permit, regardless of the number of spaces required by this Section. Notwithstanding Sections 11.1(4) and 11.1 (5), no building or structure existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall be required to provide any additional parking spaces unless and until the aggregate increase in the required number of spaces shall be greater than 50% of the spaces existing on the effective date of this ordinance. Notwithstanding Sections 11.1(4) and 11.1(5), no building or structure existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall be required to provide any additional loading spaces unless and until the aggregate change shall equal the full square footage for which one (1) additional loading space is required.
7. Site Plan Review
Any application for a building permit or occupancy permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use shall include a site plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any off-street parking or loading facilities to be provided. In accordance with Section 2.13, the Site Plan Review Committee shall review the plan.
11.2 Computation
A. Basis for Computation
The total number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based upon the requirements for the principal use of the zoning lot. However, when more than one (1) use occupies the same zoning lot, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All off-street parking facilities shall be completed before occupancy of the building or structure for which it serves. Where Table 11.1 requires parking spaces based on the number of employees, the shift having the greatest number of employees, including full-time and part-time employees, shall be the basis for the computation. Where Table 11.1 requires parking spaces based on the number of seats, each twenty-two (22) inches of bench seating shall be considered equivalent to one (1) seat.
B. Fractional Spaces
When determination of the number of required off-street parking or loading spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half (½) or less may be dropped, while a fraction in excess of one-half (½) shall be counted as one (1) parking space.
11.3 Design and Size
A. Dimensions of Spaces and Aisles
Required off-street parking spaces shall have vertical clearance of at least seven (7) feet. The dimensions of aisles shall be as shown in Figure 11.1.
Except in such instances where a variance has been granted in accordance with Section 2.17, a required off-street parking space shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and at least eighteen (18) feet in length, exclusive of access drives, aisles, ramps and columns.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-3 Zoning Ordinance
B. Surfacing and Striping
All off-street parking areas and driveways shall be improved with a hard surface pavement as specified in the current edition of the Illinois Department of Transportation Design Manual or alternate approved by the Village Engineer. Striping of the surface to define each parking space shall be provided and visible at all times.
C. Access to Spaces
A fire lane of not less than twenty (20) feet in width shall be provided where required by the Fire Department. All off-street parking facilities shall be provided with appropriate means of vehicular access in a manner that least interferes with traffic movements and allows the driver of the vehicle to proceed forward into traffic rather than back out. All required off-street parking facilities shall have vehicular access from a street, alley or driveway, containing all-weather, hard surfaced pavement. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or a driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking spaces. The location and route of access to such a parking area shall be identified and the route shall not transverse any other parking spaces. No driveway shall serve as access to more than one (1) single-family detached dwelling. Except for access to loading berths, no driveway across public property shall have a width exceeding twenty-four (24) feet, exclusive of curb returns. A driveway serving a detached single-family dwelling shall have a width of no less than eight (8) feet.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-4 Zoning Ordinance
D. Drainage
All parking and loading areas shall be graded and drained to dispose of surface water accumulation by means of an approved stormwater drainage system. Runoff from parking lots shall be detained on-site in accordance with applicable Village standards.
E. Screening
All open parking areas containing more than four (4) parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any residential or institutional property by a wall, fence or densely-planted compact hedge not less than five (5) feet in height. In such parking areas, wheelstops of masonry, steel or heavy timber shall be placed at least five (5) feet from any lot lines.
F. Lighting
Parking areas of more than ten (10) spaces shall be illuminated. Illumination of off-street parking areas shall be shielded so as not to project or reflect rays of light onto adjacent properties and so as not to create a traffic hazard on adjacent streets. The level of illumination at any point within the parking facility shall be not less than one (1) foot-candle measured at the pavement.
The level of illumination at the lot line shall not exceed one-half (.5) foot-candle measured at any residential lot line and two (2) foot-candles measured at any other lot line.
G. Slope
Except for parking spaces accessory to a single-family detached dwelling, the area of any parking facility shall have a slope approved by the authority having jurisdiction. No access ramp shall have a slope more than what is allowed by the agency having jurisdiction.
H. Maintenance
Except in the manufacturing district, no cleaning or maintenance of parking lots utilizing motorized equipment may be performed between 11:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. each day, except for the removal of snow.
11.4 Location of Spaces
A. Yards
Off-street parking spaces may be provided in surface lots, below grade, beneath a building and, in those zoning districts where specifically allowed, in parking structures. Off-street parking spaces may be located in any yard, except required front yards.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-5 Zoning Ordinance
B. Requirements for Off-Site Spaces
Parking spaces required for single- or two-family dwelling units shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling served. Parking spaces required for all other uses, except uses in the central business district established after the effective date of this ordinance, shall be located on the same lot as the use served.
Within the central business district, uses in existence on the effective date of this ordinance, which are subsequently altered or enlarged, and all new uses may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the lot on which the use is located. Such facilities shall be located within three-hundred (300) feet and shall be approved by the Site Plan Review Committee, who shall consider safety standards and sound traffic design in making their decision. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the lot on which the use is located, such facilities shall be located on property controlled by the same party who owns the lot on which the use to be served is located. Such control may be by deed or by long-term lease. Such deed or lease shall be filed with the Department of Community Development and recorded with the office of the Recorder of Deeds by the Village at the developer’s expense. The deed or lease shall require the owner or his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner, and to notify the Village if terms of the lease change. If the deed or lease terminates prior to the use served, the deed or lease shall not be released until the required off-street parking spaces are provided on the same lot as the use served or until another lot meeting all the requirements of this Section is used to provide the required parking or until the Village Board grants a variance.
11.5 Shared Parking
A. Standards
Off-street parking and loading facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use and if all regulations governing the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served are observed. However, no parking or loading space, or portion thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than one (1) use unless otherwise authorized in accordance with this Section.
B. Procedures
The Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize a reduction in the total number of required parking or loading spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly providing off-street parking when their respective hours of operation do not substantially overlap. The petitioner shall provide sufficient data to indicate that there is not a substantial conflict in the principal hours of operation of the uses. The petitioner shall submit a legal agreement guaranteeing that the parking spaces or loading spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses are in existence unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with this Article. The instrument shall be approved by the Village Attorney and shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-6 Zoning Ordinance
11.6 Accessible Parking
A. Required Spaces
In all off-street parking facilities, except single-family detached or attached dwellings, parking spaces for handicapped persons shall be provided. The number of handicapped parking spaces shall be counted toward the total number of required parking spaces and shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Illinois Administrative Code, as amended from time to time.
B. Design and Layout
Such spaces shall comply with the design standards presented in the State of Illinois Accessibility Standards provided that in no instance shall the width of any one (1) space be less than sixteen (16) feet. Such spaces shall be identified by a sign and by pavement markings indicating parking for the handicapped only. Such spaces shall be the spaces closest to the entrance of the building or structure and shall be connected by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access.
11.7 Stacking Spaces for Drive-Through Facilities
A. Required Spaces
Every drive-through facility shall provide six (6) stacking spaces per facility, plus one (1) space per waiting area provided.
B. Design and Layout
The stacking spaces shall be designed so as not to interfere with the ingress and egress to the off-street parking, traffic circulation on or off site, and traffic visibility. Drive-through facilities shall not be located in the front of the principal building and the maneuvering space shall be provided in the side or rear yard. The location of the curbcut shall be subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
11.8 Off-Street Loading
A. Required Spaces
Any building or structure, which is erected or substantially altered after the effective date of this ordinance, and which requires the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by trucks or other similar vehicles, shall provide no less than the number of off-street loading berths specified in this Section. The Planning and Zoning Commission may vary these requirements as provided in Section 2.17 of this ordinance. Loading berths shall be provided according to the Table below. For uses not specified in the Table, off-street loading berths shall be provided based on the recommendations of the Director of Economic and Community Development and approved by the Village Board, taking into consideration requirements for similar uses.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-7 Zoning Ordinance
Any loading operation shall not create traffic congestion or traffic hazards on the public streets. Space allocated for an off-street loading berth shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for any off-street parking facilities. All required off-street loading spaces shall be completed before occupancy of the building or structure.
B. Dimensions
A required off-street loading berth shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width by at least fifty (50) feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and shall have vertical clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet.

C. Surfacing and Screening
All open off-street loading berths shall be surfaced with a hard surfaced pavement as specified in the current edition of the Illinois Department of Transportation Design Manual or alternate approved by the Village Engineer. Screening of the loading berths shall be provided in accordance with Section XII.
D. Access
Each required off-street loading space shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements.
E. Location
Loading berths may be located in any yard or within the confines of a building. All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use to be served and no portion of any vehicle shall, while occupying any loading space, project into a street or alley. No loading berth shall be located within twenty-five (25) feet of the nearest point of intersection of any two (2) streets. In the manufacturing district, loading berths for vehicles of more than two (2) ton capacity shall be located no less than fifty (50) feet from any residence district. Uses which require off-street loading facilities, but which are located in buildings or structures of less floor area than is specified for such use, shall be provided with receiving facilities, accessible by motor vehicles, off any adjacent alley, service drive, or open space on the same zoning lot.
F. Maneuvering Space
Every loading space shall be provided with sufficient maneuvering space on the zoning lot where it is located to allow vehicles to access and exit the space without having to make a backing movement onto any public street.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 11-8 Zoning Ordinance
11.9 Trucks and Limousines

Village of Homewood, Illinois 12-1 Zoning Ordinance
SECTION 12 - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
12.1 Landscape Plan
The landscaping and screening requirements are intended to preserve and enhance the appearance, character, health, safety and general welfare of the Village by fostering aesthetically pleasing development. The regulations are intended to decrease the conflict between adjacent uses by minimizing the adverse impact of noise, dust, headlight glare, artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts on neighboring uses.
A. When Required
A landscape plan shall be required for all exterior construction and development activity that requires site plan review. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require landscaping for existing uses that are not proposing exterior changes requiring site plan review in accordance with Section 2.13. Landscape plans shall be drawn in conformance with the requirements in this Section. Landscape plans must be reviewed and approved by the Village Arborist.
B. Content of Landscape Plan
The plan shall show the following:
1. The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, property lines, easements, parking lots, driveways, roadways, rights-of-way, sidewalks, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, bicycle paths, fences, freestanding equipment, and drainage facilities.
2. The location, quantity, size, and name, both botanical and common names, of all existing plant materials, and any material in the right-of-way, indicating plant material to be retained and removed.
3. The location, quantity, size, and name, both botanical and common names, of all proposed plant material including, but not limited to, shade trees, evergreens, shrubs, groundcovers and turf.
4. The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at one (1) foot intervals, with proposed berming indicated using one (1) foot contour intervals.
5. Elevations of all proposed fences and retaining walls.
6. Other elevations and details as determined necessary by the Village Arborist.
C. Changes to Approved Plan
Any change to an approved landscape plan shall require the approval of the Appearance Commission. Any landscape plan, either original or amended, which does not conform to this Section shall be subject to the procedures for a variance established in Section 2.17. Landscaping made to a lot that is not in conformance with an approved landscape plan shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of Section 14.

Landscape plans shall be prepared, evaluated, and approved, based on the following design criteria:
A. Scale and Nature of Landscaping Material
The scale and nature of landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the size of the structures. For example, larger-scaled plants should generally be used to complement larger scaled buildings. Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local conditions. Planting beds should be mulched with bark chips, feather rocks, or similar materials. Mulch shall not be used as a substitute for plant materials. Domestic turf grasses should be used in areas with little or no slope to prevent the runoff of irrigation water. All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two and one-half (2½) inches in caliper, unless otherwise specified. All shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches at planting, unless otherwise specified. Evergreens should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site, particularly in those areas where screening and buffering is required. Existing plant material should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site. Effort should be made to preserve and protect existing trees with trunk diameters more than twelve (12) inches. Such trees and their root systems shall be protected from construction equipment and activity by the installation of fencing materials at the dripline of the trees.
B. Other Criteria
When reviewing a request for a variation from the landscaping requirements, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the extent to which the plan addresses the following criteria:
1. Earthen berms and existing topographic features should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where screening is necessary.
2. Plant material should be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect;
3. Detention/retention basins and ponds shall be landscaped with shade and ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, turf, groundcover and/or other plant materials.
4. While irrigation systems are required for certain landscape areas, and may be desirable for other applications, all irrigation systems shall be designed to conserve the use of water.
5. Plant material should be used to reduce energy consumption needs by placing deciduous trees on the south and west sides of buildings for shade and placing evergreens on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winds.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 12-3 Zoning Ordinance
12.3 Minimum Landscaping Of Yards
A. Turf
All yards in any zoning district within the Village shall be landscaped primarily with turf or other plant materials. Pavement of yards other than for parking or loading purposes is prohibited.
B. Other Materials
Shade trees, a minimum trunk size of two and one-half (2½) inches in caliper, shall be provided for all yards on multiple-family residential and non-residential lots at a rate of one (1) tree for every two-thousand and five-hundred (2,500) square feet of yard.
12.4 Parkway Landscaping
The following requirements shall apply to the ground areas within the public right-of-way that are not covered by pavement or sidewalks. All parkways shall be improved with turf, parkway trees and shrubs, or hard surface treatments where permitted.
A. Parkway Trees
Parkway trees shall be provided at the equivalent of one (1) tree for every forty (40) linear feet in the right-of-way adjacent to the parcel. Where appropriate, parkway trees may be clustered or spaced linearly in the right-of-way, as determined by the Director of Public Works. Trees shall be planted adjacent to the right-of-way if adequate space is not available in the parkway. Trees shall be planted at least five (5) feet from any sidewalk. The species of trees shall comply with Section 94-18 of the Municipal Code. A variety of compatible species should be included in the planting plan. The selection of tree species shall be reviewed and approved for site appropriateness by the Director of Public Works.
B. Other Landscape Materials
No plant material or barrier, except as specified herein, may be located in a dedicated public right-of-way, without the approval of the Director of Public Works. The remainder of the ground surface within the parkway shall be planted with turf, with the exception that driveways and walkways may be permitted in all parkways.
Materials prohibited in parkways, unless approved by the Director of Public Works, include ground cover, shrubs exceeding eighteen (18) inches in height at maturity, brick pavers, gravel, stone, asphalt and concrete, except in conjunction with driveways and walkways.

Village of Homewood, Illinois 12-4 Zoning Ordinance
A. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping
Not less than 5% of the interior of a parking lot shall be devoted to landscaping.

3. A minimum of 50% of every interior parking lot landscaping area shall be planted with an approved groundcover in the appropriate density to achieve complete cover within two (2) years. Mulch may be substituted for other groundcover if it is applied to 100% of the landscaping area at a thickness of at least two (2) inches.
B. Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping
Perimeter parking lot landscaping provides for the enhancement and screening of parking lots by requiring a uniform scheme of landscaping along public streets. Perimeter landscaping is required for parking lots with ten (10) or more spaces and shall be established along the edge of the parking lot. The landscape treatment shall run the full length of the yard when abutting a residential use or the public right-of-way, and 50% of the yard when abutting a non-residential use. The landscaped area shall be improved as follows:
1. One (1) shade or evergreen tree shall be planted for every forty (40) feet of yard length with trees clustered based on specific site requirements or one (1) shrub, measuring a minimum of eighteen (18) inches at planting and not to exceed four (4) feet at maturity, for every three (3) feet of yard length, clustered or spaced linearly, or a berm or low pedestrian wall the height of which provides effective screening to a maximum height of four (4) feet.
2. Perimeter landscaping shall be at least five (5) feet in width, as measured from the back of curb.
3. Landscaped areas outside of shrub and tree masses shall be planted in turf or other groundcover.

Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-1 Zoning Ordinance
SECTION 13 - NONCONFORMITIES
13.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to establish regulations for nonconforming uses, buildings, lots, or structures and specify those circumstances and conditions to which those nonconforming uses, lots, structures and buildings must comply. The intent of the ordinance is to encourage the development and maintenance of appropriate groupings of compatible uses and thus to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The intent of the Village Board is to curtail substantial investment in such nonconformities and to bring about their eventual elimination in order to preserve the integrity of the zoning districts. While such nonconformities are allowed to continue, subject to the provisions of this Section and without a specific time limitation, the regulations restrict further action that would make the nonconformity more permanent as contrary to the desired eventual elimination of the nonconformity.
13.2 General Standards of Applicability
A. Authority to Continue
Unless otherwise prohibited in this Ordinance, any nonconforming building, structure, lot, and use which existed lawfully at the time of the adoption of this ordinance and which remains nonconforming, and any such building, structure, lot, or use which has become nonconforming upon the adoption of this ordinance or of any subsequent amendments, may be continued subject to the provisions of this Section so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
B. Illegal Use
Illegal uses existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be validated by virtue of its enactment.
C. Burden of Owner to Establish Legality
The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity that is lawfully existing under the provisions of the ordinance shall, in all cases, be upon the property owner of the nonconforming use, building, structure or lot and not upon the Village.
D. Safety Regulations
All safety regulations including, but not limited to, building, fire and health, shall apply to nonconforming buildings and structures.
13.3 Nonconforming Uses of Land
This Section regulates land, buildings or structures that, on the effective date of this ordinance, are used for purposes that are not permitted in the zoning district in which they are located.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-2 Zoning Ordinance
A. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any building or structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a nonconforming use.
B. Structural Alterations
No structural alterations shall be performed on any building or structure used for a nonconforming use, except in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the building or structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting the public safety.
2. When the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconformity.
3. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building or structure in any manner.
C. Expansion of Use
A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without limitation:
1. Any extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal hours of operation on the effective date of this ordinance.
2. Expansion of any building or structure devoted entirely to a nonconforming use.
3. An expansion or extension of a use, or its accessory uses, to any structure, building, or land area, other than that occupied by such nonconforming use, on the effective date of the ordinance, that caused such use to become nonconforming.
4. An expansion or extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a building or other structure, to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of the ordinance that caused such use to become nonconforming.
D. Relocation
A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be relocated in whole, or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is relocated.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-3 Zoning Ordinance
E. Change of Use
A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted within the zoning district in which the use is located. When such a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to a permitted use, the whole or part which has been made to conform may not thereafter be changed back to a use that is not permitted. A change of use shall be deemed to occur when an existing nonconforming use has been terminated and a permitted use has commenced. Any change in use in violation of this ordinance shall be deemed an abandonment of the lawfully existing nonconforming use.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend that the Village Board allow a change of one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use if the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that the proposed use is more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such as change in use, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend that the Village Board impose conditions on the nonconforming use.
F. Discontinuation or Abandonment
If a nonconforming use is discontinued, or becomes vacant, and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, regardless of the intent to resume or not to terminate the use, such use shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land, building or structure shall comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which such land, building, or structure is located. The period of such discontinuance caused by government action, acts of God or other acts without any contributing fault by the user, shall not be included in calculating the length of discontinuance for this Section.
G. Damage or Destruction
In the event that any building or structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the owner, to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value, then the building or structure shall not be restored or rebuilt unless the building or structure, including foundation, and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The structure’s or building’s replacement value will be based on either a sale within the prior year, an appraisal within the last two (2) years or the amount for which the building or structure was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction.
When such building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at that time, it may be repaired and reconstructed and used for the same purposes as it was before the damage or destruction, provided that a building permit for the repair or reconstruction is obtained within twelve (12) months of the date of damage or destruction and construction is completed within one (1) year of the issuance of the building permit. No restoration, rebuilding, repairs or reconstruction shall be made that would create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any previously existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building or structure in any manner. In the event that the permit is not obtained within one (1) year or that repairs are not completed within one (1) year of the issuance of the building
Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-4 Zoning Ordinance
permit, then the structure or building shall not be restored unless the structure or building and the use conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event a building or structure is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the owner, the building or structure shall not be altered in any fashion except to make it conforming to all requirements of this ordinance.
13.4 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
This Section regulates buildings and structures that are existing on the effective date of this ordinance which do not conform to the yard, height, lot coverage, floor area ratio or other dimensional or bulk provisions of this ordinance.
A. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any nonconforming building or structure. No repairs or reconstruction shall be made that would create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any previously existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner.
B. Structural Alterations
No structural alterations shall be performed on any nonconforming building or structure, except in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the building or structure.
2. When the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconformity.
3. When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building or structure in any manner.
C. Additions and Enlargements
A building or structure, which is nonconforming with respect to its bulk, may be added to or enlarged provided that such addition or enlargement does not increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of the building or structure. In determining the extent of the allowable addition or enlargement, the nonconformity of the building or structure shall be based only upon those portions of the building having both foundation and roof. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged if such addition or enlargement would increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of the building or structure, such as by encroaching further into required setbacks more than the existing encroachment.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-5 Zoning Ordinance
D. Relocation
A nonconforming building or structure shall not be relocated in whole, or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the building or structure thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is relocated.
E. Damage or Destruction
In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value at that time, then the building or structure shall not be restored or rebuilt unless the building or structure, including foundation, thereafter conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
The structure’s or building’s replacement value will be based on either a sale within the previous year, an appraisal within the last two (2) years, or the amount for which structure or building was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction. When such building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of less than 50% of the replacement value at that time, it may be repaired and reconstructed provided that no new nonconformities are created and that existing degree of nonconformity is not increased. A building permit shall be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair or reconstruction within one (1) year of the date of damage or destruction, and the construction shall be completed within one (1) year of issuance of the building permit.
In the event that the permit is not obtained within one (1) year or that repairs are not completed within one (1) year of the issuance of the building permit, then the structure or building shall not be restored unless the structure or building conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the property owner, the building or structure as restored or repaired shall comply with all requirements of this ordinance.
13.5 Nonconforming Lots of Record
This Section regulates lots of record, existing on the effective date of this ordinance, which do not conform with the lot area or lot width requirements for the district in which they are located. No nonconforming lot of record may be improved except in compliance with this Section.
A. Individual Lots of Record in R1 and R2
In the R1 and R2 zoning districts, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and its accessory buildings may be erected on a single nonconforming lot of record, provided that the lot is in separate ownership.
Village of Homewood, Illinois 13-6 Zoning Ordinance
B. Lots of Record Held in Common Ownership
If on the effective date of this ordinance two (2) or more lots of record with continuous frontage in single ownership do not meet the requirements for lot width or lot area as established by this ordinance, the land so involved shall be considered to be a single undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance. No portion of said parcel shall be used, transferred or conveyed which does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements established by this ordinance. No division of the parcel shall be made which leaves remaining lot(s) with lot width or area below the requirements as stated in this ordinance. No building permit shall be issued for the use of any lot or portion of a lot transferred or conveyed in violation of this section.
No lot shall be created by subdivision or any other means, which does not comply with all provisions of this ordinance, unless the owner has been granted a variation in accordance with Section 2.17. This provision shall not prevent the division of existing multi-family dwelling units into separate ownership, such as condominiums or fee simple townhomes.
C. Variation
A variation from this Section may be obtained to permit the separation of two (2) adjoining lots held in common ownership, provided that the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that the applicant complies with the standards for a variation in Section 2.17. In addition, the applicant must comply with one of the following standards:
1. Both lots met the lot area and lot width requirements in effect at the time the applicant purchased the lots.
2. Over half of the lots within five-hundred (500) feet of the subject lots have been developed as individual building sites and do not comply with either the lot width or lot area requirement for the district in which they are located.
3. The owners of the abutting lots refuse to sell or convey, at a fair market price, portions of their lots that could be added to the subject lots to render them conforming without rendering said abutting lots or structures located on such lots nonconforming.
13.6 Condemnation
The Village, at any time, by ordinance duly enacted, and in accordance with the authority vested in it by 65 ILCS 5/11-13-17 and other state and federal laws, may acquire by negotiated purchase, by condemnation, or by other means any buildings or structures that do not conform to the Village standards.
