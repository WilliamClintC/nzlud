These five service groups address the common areas of needs and generally utilize similar approaches to their resolution.

Section 42.   Fire Alarm Systems 
 
 
I   Preamble 
 
WHEREAS, there has been an increase in recent years in the use of fire alarm systems which operate by way of a Master Box or by way of a central station operating company; and 
 
WHEREAS, improper installation, defective equipment, lack of maintenance or other reasons cause fire alarm systems to malfunction; and 
 
WHEREAS, each time the Hudson Fire Department responds to a fire alarm activation because of a fire alarm malfunction the estimated cost to the Town of Hudson is a minimum of $150; and 
 
WHEREAS, in addition to the financial cost, each malfunction requires that Hudson Fire Department personnel respond, thus decreasing the number of Hudson Fire Department personnel available to respond to an actual fire or other emergency; and

   5.1.8 Temporary Moratorium on Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers and the     Sale & Distribution of Drug Paraphernalia      
   5.1.8.1 Purpose 
 
By vote at the State election on November 6, 2012, the voters of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved a law regulating the cultivation, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes.   The law provides that it is effective on January 1, 2013 and the State Department of Public Health is required to issue regulations regarding implementation within 120 days of the law’s effective date. Currently under the Zoning Bylaw, a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center is not a permitted use in the Town of Hudson and any regulations promulgated by the State  Department of Public Health are expected to provide guidance to the Town in  regulating medical marijuana, including Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers.  The regulation of medical marijuana raises unique and complex legal, planning, and public  health, safety and general welfare issues and the Town needs sufficient time to stud y  and consider the regulation of Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers and the Sale and Distribution of Drug paraphernalia and address such issues, as well as to address the potential impact of the state regulations on local zoning and to undertake a concise and meaningful planning process to consider amending the Protective Zoning Bylaw regarding regulation medical marijuana treatment centers and other uses related to the regulation of medical marijuana as well as the sale and distribution of drug paraphernalia. The Town intends to adopt a temporary moratorium o n the use of land and  structures in the Town for Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers and the sale and distribution of drug paraphernalia so as to allow the Town sufficient time to engage in a planning process to address the effects of such structures and uses in the Town and to enact Zoning By-Laws in a manner consistent with sound land use planning goals and objectives so as to encourage the appropriate use of the land. 
5.1.8.2  Definitions 
 
  "Medical Marijuana Treatment Center” shall mean a ''not-for-profit entity, as    defined  by Massachusetts J aw only, registered by the Department of Public    Health , that acquires, cultivates,  possesses,  processes  (including the     development of related  products such as food, tinctures,  aerosols, oil s or    ointments). transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers    marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational    material s to qualifying patients or their personal caregivers." 
 
  “Drug Paraphernalia” shall be as defined under M.G.L Chapter 94C Section 1 as    amended. 
 
5.1.8.3  Temporary Moratorium 
 
  For the reasons set forth above and notwithstanding any other provision of the   Protective Zoning Bylaw to the contrary, the Town hereby adopts a temporary    moratorium on the use of land or structures for a Medical Marijuana     Treatment Center and for the Sale and Distribution of Drug Paraphernalia. The    moratorium shall be in effect through June 30, 2014. During the moratorium   period, the Town shall undertake a comprehensive planning process to address   the potential impacts of medical marijuana in the Town, consider the     Department of Public Health regulations regarding Medical Marijuana    Treatment Facilities and related uses as promulgated, and shall consider    adopting new Protective Zoning Bylaw provisions to address the impact and    operation of Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers and related uses.

5.6  OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT  
 
Open Space Residential Development (OSRD) 
 
Purpose and intent. 
 
1) The Primary Purposes for this bylaw are the following: 
 
a) To allow for greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential developments; 

b) To encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land, forestry land, wildlife habitat, other natural resources including aquifers, water bodies and wetlands, and historical and archaeological resources; 

c) To encourage a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; 

d) To minimize the total amount of disturbance on the site; 

e) To further the goals and policies of the Town of Hudson Community Development Plan and Open Space and Recreation Plan; 

f) To facilitate the construction and maintenance of housing, streets, utilities, and public 



services in a more economical and efficient manner. 
 
2) The Secondary Purposes for this bylaw are the following: 


 
a) To preserve and enhance the community character; 



b) To protect and enhance the value of real property; 

c) To provide for a diversified housing stock; 

d) To provide affordable housing to persons of low and moderate income. 



5.6.1  Definitions 
 
1) Basic Maximum Number – The number of units that would be allowed on a site using the standard Zoning Bylaw Provisions and/or Subdivision Rules and Regulations as determined by a Yield Plan as described in 5.6.4 (a). 


 
2) Hard Stormwater Management Techniques – Structural stormwater management techniques including, but not limited to, catch basins, subsurface piping, stormwater inlets, and subsurface leaching facilities. These techniques generally require heavy infrastructure and often result in significant alteration of the site hydrology. 


 
3) Low-Income Household – These households shall be defined as those in the “Very Low Income” affordability range as published annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 


 
4) Major Residential Development-Any new development that will create more than four (4) residential lots 


 
5) Moderate Income Household – These households shall be defined as those in the “Low Income” affordability range as published annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 


 
6) Soft Stormwater Management Techniques – Non-structural stormwater management techniques that use passive surface pre-treatment of stormwater in conjunction with decentralized recharge to achieve a low-impact design that attempts to mimic pre-development hydrologic conditions to the greatest practicable extent. 


 
5.6.2  Applicability 
 
1) Any Major Residential Development may be permitted by issuance of a Special Permit from 


the Planning Board for OSRD in accordance with this bylaw.  
 
2) Developments of 4 lots or smaller may also apply for an ORSD Special Permit subject to the 


following criteria: 
 
a) Contiguous Parcels. To be eligible for consideration as an OSRD, the tract shall consist of a parcel or set of contiguous parcels. The Planning Board may determine that two or more parcels separated by a road or other man-made feature are “contiguous” for the purpose of this section, if they will serve as a singular resource and effectively satisfy the Purpose and Intent of this bylaw as listed in Section 5.6.1. 



 
b) Land Division. To be eligible for consideration as an OSRD, the tract may be a subdivision or a division of land pursuant to G.L. c. 41, § 81P provided, however, an OSRD may also be permitted when the property is held in condominium, cooperative ownership or other form where the property is not subdivided. 



5.6.3 Pre-application 
 
1) Conference. The applicant is very strongly encouraged to request a pre-application review at a regular business meeting of the Planning Board. If one is requested, the Planning Board shall invite the Conservation Commission, Board of Health, Department of Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief and Building Commissioner. The purpose of a pre-application review is to minimize the applicant’s costs of engineering and other technical experts, and to commence discussions with the Planning Board at the earliest possible stage in the development. At the pre-application review, the applicant may outline the proposed development including both conventional and OSRD models, seek preliminary feedback from the Planning Board and/or its technical experts, and set a timetable for submittal of a formal application. The Planning Board may engage technical experts to review the informal plans of the applicant and to facilitate submittal of a formal application for an OSRD Special Permit. An Applicant shall be required to pay for reasonable consulting fees to provide peer review of the OSRD application.  Such fees shall be held by the Town in a separate account and used only for out-of-pocket expenses associated with the review of the OSRD application by outside consultants, including, but not limited to, attorneys, engineers, urban designers, housing consultants, planners, and other professionals. Any surplus remaining after the completion of such review shall be returned to the Applicant forthwith. 


 
 
2) Submittals. In order to facilitate review of the Special Permit at the pre-application stage, 


applicants are strongly encouraged to submit the following information: 
 
a) Site Context Map. This map shall illustrate the parcel in connection to its surrounding neighborhood. Based upon existing data sources and field inspections, it shall show various kinds of major natural resource areas or features that cross parcel lines or that are located on adjoining lands. This map enables the Planning Board to understand the site in relation to what is occurring on adjacent properties. 



 
b) Existing Conditions/Site Analysis Map. This map familiarizes officials with existing conditions on the property. Based upon existing data sources and field inspections, this base map shall locate and describe noteworthy resources that could be protected through sensitive subdivision layouts. These resources shall include wetlands, riverfront areas, floodplains and steep slopes, but may also include mature nondegraded woodlands, hedgerows, farmland, unique or special wildlife habitats, historic or cultural features (such as old structures or stone walls), unusual geologic formations and scenic views into and out from the property. Where appropriate, photographs of these resources should accompany the map. By overlaying this plan onto a development plan, the parties involved can clearly see where conservation priorities and desired development overlap/conflict. 



 
c) Other Information. In addition, applicants are encouraged to submit the information set forth in 5.6.5(1) in a form acceptable to the Planning Board. 



 
 
3) Site Visit. Applicants are encouraged to request a site visit by the Planning Board and/or its 


Agents in order to facilitate pre-application review of the Special Permit. If one is requested, 
the Planning Board shall invite the Conservation Commission, Board of Health, Department of Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief and Building Commissioner. 
 
4) Design Criteria. The design process and criteria set forth below in Sections 5.6.6 and 5.6.7 should be discussed by the parties at the pre-application conference and site visit.

5.6.5 Design Process 
 
At the time of the application for the Special Permit, in conformance with Section 5.6.5(1), applicants are required to demonstrate to the Planning Board that the following Design Process was performed by a multidisciplinary team of which one member must be a certified Landscape Architect and considered in determining the layout of proposed streets, house lots, unit placement if treated as a condominium, including designation of all common areas and open space. 
 
1) Identifying Conservation Areas. Identify preservation land by two steps. First, Primary 


Conservation Areas (such as wetlands, riverfront areas, and floodplains regulated by state 
or federal law) and Secondary Conservation Areas (including unprotected elements of 
the natural landscape such as steep slopes, mature woodlands, prime farmland, meadows, 
wildlife habitats and cultural features such as historic and archaeological sites and scenic 
views) shall be identified and delineated. Second, the Potentially Developable Area shall 
consist of land outside identified Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas. 
 
2) Locating House Sites. Locate the approximate sites of individual houses within the 


Potentially Developable Area and include the delineation of private yards and shared 
amenities, so as to reflect an integrated community. 
 
3) Aligning the Streets and Trails. Align streets in order to access the house lots or units. 


Additionally, new trails should be laid out to create internal and external connections to 
existing and/or potential future streets, sidewalks, and trails. 
 
4) Lot Lines. Draw in the lot lines using assumed lot lines if the ownership is in condominium, 


cooperative or other similar form of common ownership. 
5.6.6  Design Standards. 
 
The following Generic and Site Specific Design Standards shall apply to all Sketch Plans for OSRD’s and shall govern the development and design process: 
 
1) Generic Design Standards 


 
a) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by 



minimizing tree and soil removal. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the 
general appearance of the neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual 
building sites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover. 
Topography, tree cover, surface water buffers, and natural drainage ways shall be 
treated as fixed determinants of road and lot configuration rather than as malleable 
elements that can be changed to follow a preferred development scheme. 
 
b) Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve 



natural topography, significant landmarks, and trees; to minimize cut and fill; and to 
preserve and enhance views and vistas on or off the subject parcel.  A reduction in required pavement width shall be considered by the Planning Board. 
 
c) Mixed-use development, if allowed in the underlying district, shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and the use, scale, and architecture of existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationship to the proposed buildings. 



 
d) All open space (landscaped and usable) shall be designed to add to the visual 



amenities of the area by maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or 
overlooking it from nearby properties. 
 
e) The removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures, or 



architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable, whether these exist 
on the site or on adjacent properties. 
 
2) Site Specific Design Standards 


 
a) Mix of Housing Types. The OSRD may consist of any combination of single-family 



and two-family structures. Multifamily structures of not more than four (4) units may 
and two-family structures. Multifamily structures of not more than four (4) units may 
also be permitted by the Planning Board if they serve the purpose and intent of the 
OSRD Bylaw, as stated in Section 5.6.1. 
 
b) Parking. Each dwelling unit for single or two-family homes shall be served by two 



(2) off-street parking spaces per unit. Parking spaces in front of garages may count in   
this computation. For dwelling units with fewer than two bedrooms AND in structures 
containing four or more units, the applicant shall provide one and a half-(1.5) parking 
spaces per unit. Calculations for parking spaces in these developments shall be 
rounded up to the nearest integer where necessary. The Planning board may choose 
to modify these requirements during the review process in response to conditions 
specific to an individual proposal. 
 
 
c) Drainage. The Planning Board shall encourage the use of Soft Stormwater 



Management Techniques and other Low Impact Development techniques that reduce 
 impervious surface and enable infiltration where appropriate. 
 
d) Screening and Landscaping. All structural surface stormwater management facilities 



shall be accompanied by a conceptual landscape plan. 
 
e) On-site Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation. Walkways, trails and bicycle paths shall 



be provided to link residences with recreation facilities (including parkland and open 
space) and adjacent land uses where appropriate. 
 
f) Disturbed Areas. Every effort shall be made to minimize the area of disturbed areas 



on the tract. A disturbed area is any land not left in its natural vegetated state. 
 
5.6.8 Open Space Requirements 
 
1) Open Space Requirement. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the site shall be open space.  The percentage of this open space that can be wetland shall not exceed the percentage of wetland for the entire site under existing conditions as shown on the Sketch Plan. 


 
2) Description of Restriction on Open Space. Any proposed open space, unless conveyed to the Town or its Conservation Commission, shall be subject to a permanent Conservation 


or Agricultural Preservation Restriction in accordance with G.L. c. 184 § 31, approved by  
the Planning Board and Board of Selectmen and enforceable by the Town, conforming to the standards of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, Division of Conservation Services, or Department of Agricultural Resources. Such land shall be perpetually kept in an open state, shall be preserved exclusively for the purposes set forth 
herein, and shall be maintained in a manner which will ensure its suitability for its intended 
purposes. Any proposed open space that does not qualify for inclusion in a Conservation 
Restriction or Agricultural Preservation Restriction or that is rejected from inclusion in these programs by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall be subject to a Restrictive Covenant, which shall be approved by the Planning Board and Board of Selectmen and enforceable by the Town. 
 
a) The open space shall be contiguous. Open Space will still be considered contiguous if 



it is separated by a roadway or an accessory amenity. The Planning Board may waive 
this requirement for all or part of the required open space where it is determined 
that allowing noncontiguous open space will promote the goals of this bylaw and/or 
protect identified primary and secondary conservation areas. 
 
b) The open space shall be used for wildlife habitat and conservation and the following 



additional purposes: historic preservation, outdoor education, passive recreation, 
aquifer protection, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, a combination of these uses, and 
shall be served by suitable public access for such purposes. The Planning Board may permit a small portion of the open space to be paved or built upon for structures accessory to the dedicated use or uses of such open space (i.e., pedestrian walks and bike paths) so long as it supports the primary and secondary purposes of the OSRD and is consistent with state and local level environmental protections. 
 
c) Wastewater and stormwater management systems serving the OSRD may be located 



within the open space. Surface systems, such as retention and detention ponds, shall 
not qualify towards the minimum open space required. 
 
3) Ownership of the Open Space. The open space shall, at the Planning Board’s election, be 


conveyed to: 
 
a) The Town or its Conservation Commission; 

b) A nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open 



space and any of the purposes for such open space set forth above; 
c) A corporation, homeowners association or trust owned jointly or in common by 



the owners of lots or units within the OSRD. If such corporation or trust is utilized, 
ownership thereof shall pass with conveyance of the lots in perpetuity. Maintenance 
of such open space and facilities shall be permanently guaranteed by such corporation 
or trust which shall provide for mandatory assessments for maintenance expenses 
to each lot and unit. Each individual deed, and the deed or trust or articles of 
incorporation, shall include provisions designed to effect these provisions. Documents 
creating such homeowners association, trust or corporation shall be submitted to the 
Planning Board for approval, and shall thereafter be recorded. 
d) A private owner for agricultural, horticultural or forestry. 



 
4) Maintenance of Open Space. In any case where open space is not conveyed to the Town, the Town shall be granted an easement over such land sufficient to ensure it’s perpetual maintenance as conservation or recreation land. Such easement shall provide that in the event the trust or other owner fails to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, the Town may, after notice to the lot owners and public hearing, enter upon such land to maintain it in order to prevent or abate a nuisance. The cost of such maintenance by the Town shall be assessed against the properties within the development and/or to the owner of the open space. The Town may file a lien against the lot or lots to ensure payment of such maintenance. 


 
5.6.9      Reduction of Dimensional Requirements 
 
Applicant may propose to modify lot size, unit placement, shape, and other dimensional requirements for lots within an OSRD, subject to the following limitations: 
 
1) Frontage. Lots having reduced area or frontage shall not have frontage on a street other than a street created by the OSRD; provided, however, that the Planning Board may waive this requirement where it is determined that such reduced lot(s) will further the goals of this 


bylaw. The minimum frontage may be reduced from the frontage otherwise required in the 
zoning district; provided, however, that no lot shall have less than 50 feet of frontage. 
 
2) Setbacks. Every dwelling fronting on the proposed roadways shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the roadway right-of-way, and 10 feet from any rear or side lot line. In no event shall structures be closer than 20 feet to each other. Where structures containing three to four dwelling units are being proposed, the side lot lines between units may be 0 feet, however the distance between structures shall be a minimum of 20 feet. 


5.6.10   Increases in Permissible Density 
 
The Planning Board may award a density bonus to increase the number of dwelling units beyond the Basic Maximum Number for an OSRD Plan. The density bonus for the OSRD shall not, in the aggregate, exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Basic Maximum Number. Computations shall be rounded up to the next whole number. A density bonus may be awarded in the following circumstances: 
 
1) For each additional ten percent (10%) of the site (over and above the required 50%) set aside as open space, a bonus of one (1) market unit may be added to the Basic Maximum Number. Calculations shall be rounded up to the nearest integer when determining this bonus. 


 
2) For every two (2) dwelling units restricted in perpetuity to occupancy by Moderate-Income 


Households, or for every one (1) dwelling unit restricted in perpetuity to occupancy by Low- 
Income Households, one (1) market rate dwelling unit may be added to the Basic Maximum 
Number. Affordable housing units may be used toward density bonuses only if they can be 
counted toward the Town’s affordable housing inventory as determined by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development or it’s successor. The applicant shall 
provide documentation demonstrating that the unit(s) shall count toward the community’s affordable housing inventory to the satisfaction of the Planning Board. 
 
3) For every historic structure preserved and subject to a historic preservation restriction, one 


(1) dwelling unit may be added to the Basic Maximum Number. 
5.6.11     Decision of the Planning Board 
 
1) Criteria for Approval. The Planning Board will review all data and hold a public hearing 


in accordance with M.G.L.c.40A, section 9. The Board may approve the Plan with or without conditions. The Board shall disapprove the plan only if it finds that either the OSRD Development (Sketch Plan) is not a good faith design, or that the Plan does not conform to the requirements of the Bylaw. The Board may grant a Special Permit for an OSRD if it determines that the proposed OSRD has less detrimental impact on the tract than a conventional subdivision of the property and finding that the following eight (8) factors are present: 
a) That the OSRD achieves greater flexibility and creativity in the design of residential 



or unit developments than a conventional plan; 
 
b) That the OSRD promotes permanent preservation of open space, agricultural land, 



forestry land, other natural resources including water bodies and wetlands, and 
historical and archaeological resources; 
 
c) That the OSRD promotes a less sprawling and more efficient form of development 



that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural 
features better than a conventional subdivision; 
 
d) That the OSRD reduces the total amount of disturbance on the site; 



 
e) That the OSRD furthers the goals and policies of existing community planning 



documents including, but not limited to, the Open Space and Recreation Plan, and 
EO418 Community Development Plan; 
 
f) That the OSRD facilitates the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities, and 



public services in a more economical and efficient manner; 
 
g) That the Concept Plan and its supporting narrative documentation complies with all 



sections of this zoning bylaw. 
 
h) That the proposed design does not create undo risk to public health, safety and 



welfare. 
 
 
2) Relationship between Concept Plan and Definitive Subdivision Plan. Any Special Permit for OSRD that is granted a Special Permit and shows a subdivision must be followed by the  


submittal of a Definitive Subdivision plan in accordance with the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the Town. The OSRD Special Permit shall be reconsidered if there is substantial variation between the Definitive Subdivision Plan and the Concept Plan. If the Planning Board finds that a substantial variation exists, it shall hold a public hearing on the modifications to the Concept Plan. A substantial variation shall be any of the following: 
 
a) An increase in the number of building lots and/or units; 

b) A significant decrease in the open space acreage; 

c) A significant change in the lot layout or unit placement; 

d) A significant change in the general development pattern which adversely affects 



natural landscape features and open space preservation; 
e) Significant changes to the stormwater management facilities; and/or 

f) Significant changes in the wastewater management systems. 



 
5.6.12   Severability 
 
If any provision of this bylaw is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the bylaw shall not be affected thereby. The invalidity of any section or sections or parts of any section or sections of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the town’s zoning bylaw.

After seven (7) months, a new application will be required conforming to the rules and regulations in effect at the time of the new submission.  Final approval, if granted, shall be endorsed on the original drawing of the Definitive Plan by the signatures of a majority of the Planning Board but not until the statutory twenty (20) day appeal period has elapsed following the filing of the Board's certificate of approval or disapproval, as the case may be, with the Town Clerk and said Clerk has notified the Board that no appeal has been filed.  After the Definitive Plan has been approved and endorsed, the Planning Board shall return the original to the Applicant.

Failure to request extension of time prior to the expiration of the said approval period shall result in the Planning Board notifying the Building Inspector that no additional building permits should be issued in said development.  The request for extension shall state the reasons for said extension and also the length of time requested.  Extension of time shall not in any case exceed one (1) year.  Additional extensions after the first may be applied for but not until at least ten (10) months have expired on the extension in effect. 
 
3.3.12.4. Once recorded the Applicant shall file one (1) copy of the approved and recorded Definitive Plan each with the Board of Health, Assessor’s Office, the Fire and Police Departments, the Department of Licenses, Permits and Inspections and the Light and Power Department, and one (1) copy and a mylar thereof with the Department of Public Works.

3.3.17.1. If a subdivision is to be constructed in phases, each phase shall be completed before the next in sequence is begun, unless written permission of the Planning Board is obtained. 
4.0. DESIGN STANDARDS. 
 
All proposed building lots shown on a Subdivision Plan submitted to the Board for approval shall contain at least the minimum area and frontage required by the Zoning District in which the land is located. The Planning Board encourages the use of low-impact development (LID) techniques and practices to minimize the effects on the environment. The Board shall consider the benefits of LID practices when reviewing subdivision waivers and design features that maintain the character of the Town of Hudson and protect its natural resources. 
 
Green Development Practices: All developments should, to the greatest extent practicable, include strategies for environmentally responsible design as formalized in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, NAHB Model Home Building Guidelines or the ICC National Green Building Standard, all of which minimize the depletion of natural resources; control erosion and minimize impact on natural areas; use native and water efficient plants in landscaping; increase energy efficiency in construction and operations; conserve water through use of efficient fixtures and appliances and irrigation systems using rainwater and greywater; and use environmentally “friendly” materials. To this end, the development should incorporate Low Impact Design (LID) techniques to the greatest extent practicable. The greater the density of the development, the more important the use of these techniques becomes to protecting the environment and on site and off site individual water wells, which are the exclusive source of drinking water for all residents, businesses and municipal users in Hudson. 
 
4.1. Streets. 
 
4.1.1. Location. 
 
4.1.1.1.

4.1.1.4. Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property shall not be permitted, except where, in the opinion of the Planning Board, such strips shall be in the public interest. 
 
4.1.1.5. Adequate Access from Public Way. 
 
 a) Where the street system within a subdivision does not connect with or have, in the opinion of the Board, adequate access from a Town, County, or State (public) way, the Board may require as a condition of approval of a plan, that such adequate access be provided by the subdivider, and/or that the subdivider make physical improvements to and within such a way of access, in accord with the provisions of Section 5.0. of these regulations, from the boundary of the subdivision to a Town, County, or State way. 
 
 b) Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the subdivider to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to a width at least commensurate with that required within the subdivision, and to make physical improvements to and within the abutting public way.  Any such dedication of land for the purpose of such way and any such work performed within such public way shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne by the subdivider.

4.1.2.3. A tangent at least one-hundred and fifty (150) feet in length shall separate all reverse curves on major and secondary streets except where at least one (1) radius is five-hundred (500) feet or more or where the radius of curvature of both the curves is in excess of two (2) times the minimum specified in Section 4.1.2.2. 
 
4.1.2.4. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at right angles.  No street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees. Intersection angles less than 75 degrees shall be approved on a case-by-case basis. 
 
4.1.2.5. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded or cut back to provide for a curb radius of not less than thirty (30) feet.  However, when the intersection of two (2) streets varies more than ten (10) degrees from a right angle, the radius of the curve at the obtuse angle may be less, and at the acute angle may be greater, than thirty (30) feet to the extent approved or required by the Planning Board. 
 
4.1.2.6. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at intervals in a range of six-hundred (600) feet to twelve-hundred (1,200) feet in length, unless otherwise specified by the Planning Board.

 b) Major streets and such secondary streets which, in the judgment of the Planning Board, may in the future be changed in character to become a major street: sixty (60) feet in a low density area or greater as provided in Section 4.1.3.2. 
 
 c) The minimum pavement width shall be twenty-four feet (24') 
 
4.1.3.2. When a minor street will provide the only access for lots fronting on a length in excess of five-hundred (500) feet or where, on a major street, potential volume or safety warrants, in the opinion of the Planning Board, the Board may require a greater right-of-way than that specified above and may require construction of a divided roadway. 
 
4.1.4. Grade. 
 
4.1.4.1. The minimum centerline grade for any street shall be not less than one percent (1.0%). 
 
4.1.4.2. The maximum centerline grade for streets shall be as follows:

     Streets      Planning Board 
 Crests        28        55 
 Sags        35        55 
 
 Roadways should have a cross slope at two (2) percent or one quarter (1/4) inch per foot. 
 
4.1.4.4.  The grade of any street, unless approved by the Planning Board, shall be so designed that the surface run-off of water shall be from the building line to the street.  Where one side of a street drops off so that surface water run-off cannot drain into the street, provision must be shown for drainage pipes and catch basins, with any easement needed, to prevent overflow onto neighboring lots or erosion of banks. 
 
4.1.4.5. Where a grade is four (4) percent or greater within one-hundred and fifty (150) feet of the intersection of street right-of-way lines, there shall be provided in a residential subdivision a leveling area of at least seventy-five (75) feet, with a maximum grade of three (3) percent. 
 
4.1.4.6. Where curves and grades combine to create potentially dangerous driving conditions, the Planning Board may require a suitable amount of super elevation of the curves or other protection. 
 
4.1.5. Dead-end Streets.

Dead-end streets shall be measured from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street.  If a dead-end street is longer than one-thousand (1,000) feet in a non-residential subdivision, the Board may require a divided roadway. No dead-end street or extension thereof shall be less in length than one and one-half (1-1/2) times the frontage requirement for the zoning district in which it is located, said length to be measured from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street to the outside diameter of the cul-de-sac (turn-around).  
 
4.1.5.2. Dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of a least one-hundred and ten (110) feet, and a property line diameter of at least one-hundred and twenty (120) feet unless otherwise specified by the Planning Board. The Planning Board may, at its option, require a minimum outside roadway diameter of one- hundred and forty (140) feet, a property line diameter of one- hundred and sixty (160) feet, if the dead-end street is not intended to connect with another street at some future point in time.  Where a future street is projected beyond the circle, the circle shall be designed in relation to such extension.  The turnaround or stub shall be located at the property line of the subdivision, unless the Planning Board approves otherwise. 
 
4.1.5.3. The Board may require a roadway easement from the end of the dead-end street to adjacent property.  If a dead-end street is subsequently extended beyond the required turnaround, any easement appurtenant to a lot not abutting the turnaround, except that portion of the turn-around included in said extension shall terminate upon the approval and recording of a certificate by the Planning Board of the construction of said extension, at which time additional land used for the circle may be relinquished to the adjacent property. 
 
4.1.6. Street Names. 
 
4.1.6.1. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Board to provide names in keeping with the character of the Town.  Proposed street names shall not duplicate nor bear phonetic resemblance to the name of existing public ways, paper streets, or any other way qualified to afford frontage under Section 81-L of Chapter G.L.

5.3.4.1. General Pre-Development and Construction Site Standards.  
 
All development in the Town of Hudson is subject to the following pre-development and construction site standards to ensure that all sources of soil erosion and sediment on the construction site are adequately controlled, and that existing site features that naturally aid in stormwater management are protected to the maximum extent practical. 
 
(A) Minimize Land Disturbance. Development of a lot or site shall require the least amount of vegetation clearing, soil disturbance, duration of exposure, soil compaction and topography changes as possible.  
 
(1) To the extent feasible, soils best suited for infiltration shall be retained and natural areas consisting of tree canopy and other vegetation shall be preserved, preferably in contiguous blocks or linear corridors.  
 
(2) The time the soil is left disturbed shall be minimized. The Board may require project phasing to minimize the extent of soil disturbance and erosion during each phase of site development. 
 
(3) There shall be no soil compaction except in the construction disturbance area, which shall be identified and delineated in the field with appropriate safety or landscape fencing.  In areas outside the disturbance area there shall also be no storage of construction vehicles, construction materials, or fill, nor shall these areas be used for circulation.  
 
(4) Development on steep slopes equal to or in excess of 15%, or which results in such slopes, shall be subject to conditional use review. 
 
(B) Preserve Natural Areas. Development shall not result in an undue adverse impact on fragile environments, including wetlands, wildlife habitats, streams, lakes, steep slopes, floodplains and vegetated riparian buffers.

The guidelines suggest a variety of means by which the applicant might comply with the standards. The guidelines are intended to aid the applicant in the design process and the Board when reviewing applications. Options for compliance with the standards are not limited to the guidelines listed. 
 
Standard 1: Vegetation and Landscaping 
Vegetative and landscaping controls that intercept the path of surface runoff shall be considered as a component of the comprehensive stormwater management plan. 
 
Guideline 1.1. Utilize two-track surfaces with grass in-between to provide water infiltration for roads, driveways, parking lots and other types of drivable or walkable surfaces. 
 
Guideline 1.2. Design parking lot landscaping to function as part of the development’s stormwater management system utilizing vegetated islands with bioretention functions. 
 
Guideline 1.3. Incorporate existing natural drainage ways and vegetated channels, rather than the standard concrete curb and gutter configuration to decrease flow velocity and allow for stormwater infiltration.  
 
Guideline 1.4.  Divert water from downspouts away from driveway surfaces and into bioretention areas or rain gardens to capture, store, and infiltrate stormwater on-site. 
 
Guideline 1.5. Encourage construction of vegetative LID stormwater controls (bioretention, swales, filter strips, buffers) on land held in common. 
 
Standard 2: Development on Steep Slopes 
Development on steep slopes equal to or in excess of 15% shall be sited and constructed, and slopes stabilized to minimize risks to surface and ground waters and to protect neighboring properties from damage.  
 
Guideline 2.1. Prohibit development, re-grading and clearing of vegetation on land where the slope is greater than 25%. 
 
Guideline 2.2. Locate house sites, subsurface sewage systems and parking areas on the flattest portion of the site. 
 
Guideline 2.3. Minimize crossing steep slopes with roads and driveways and lay them out to follow topographic contours in order to minimize soil and vegetation disturbance and to preserve important natural features. Avoid long driveways 
 
Standard 3: Reduce Impervious Surfaces 
Stormwater shall be managed through land development strategies that emphasize the reduction of impervious surface areas such as streets, sidewalks, driveway and parking areas and roofs. Stormwater management is subject to the Site Plan Approval process as mandated in the Town of Hudson Protective Zoning By-Laws, Section 7.1.7  
 
Guideline 3.1. Evaluate the minimum widths of all streets and driveways to demonstrate that the proposed width is the narrowest possible necessary to conform with safety and traffic concerns and requirements. 
 
Guideline 3.2. Reduce the total length of residential streets by examining alternative street layouts to determine the best option for increasing the number of homes per unit length. 
 
Guideline 3.3. Minimize the number of residential street cul-de-sacs and incorporate vegetated islands with bioretention to reduce their impervious cover and provide for infiltration. The radius of cul-de-sacs should be the minimum required to accommodate emergency and maintenance vehicles. Consider alternative turn-around areas. 
 
Guideline 3.4. Reduce driveway lengths by minimizing setback distances. Encourage common driveways. 
 
Guideline 3.5. Use permeable pavement for parking stalls and spillover parking, sidewalks, driveways and bike trails. 
 
Guideline 3.6. Establish parking maximums and utilize shared parking for uses with different peak demand periods. 
Guideline 3.7. Reduce building footprints by using more than one floor level. 
 
Standard 4: Low Impact Integrated Management Practices (IMPs) 
Stormwater shall be managed through the use of small-scale controls to capture, store and infiltrate stormwater close to its source. 
 
Guideline 4.1. Create vegetated depressions, commonly known as bioretention areas or rain gardens that collect runoff and allow for short-term ponding and slow infiltration. Raingardens consist of a relatively small depressed or bowl shaped planning bed that treats runoff from storms of one inch or less. 
 
Guideline 4.2. Locate dry wells consisting of gravel or stone-filled pits to catch water from roof downspouts or paved areas.  
 
Guideline 4.3. Use filter strips or bands of dense vegetation planted immediately downstream of a runoff source to filter runoff before it enters a receiving structure or water body. Natural or man-made vegetated riparian buffers adjacent to waterbodies  provide erosion control, sediment filtering and habitat. 
 
Guideline 4.4. Utilize shallow grass-lined channels to convey and store runoff.  
 
Guideline 4.5. Incorporate rooftop gardens which partially or completely cover a roof with vegetation and soil or a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. 
 
Guideline 4.6. Use permeable paving and sidewalk construction materials that allow stormwater to seep through into the ground. 
 
Guideline 4.7. Use rain barrels and cisterns of various sizes that store runoff conveyed through building downspouts. Rain barrels are generally smaller structures, located above ground. Cisterns are larger, often buried underground, and may be connected to the building’s plumbing or irrigation system. 
 
Guideline 4.8. Add minerals and organic materials to soils to increase its capacity for absorbing moisture and sustaining vegetation. 
 
Guideline 4.9. Utilize tree box filters placed below grade, covered with a grate, filled with filter media and planted with a tree, to act both as a water retention tank and a natural filter. 
 
5.3.4.4. Detention/retention basins should be designed and constructed so as to:

All persons taking water supplied by the Town shall prevent all waste of water.
The Director of Public Works, or any of his agents or assistants, may enter the premises of any water user
to examine any water pipes and plumbing therein, or thereon, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there
is any waste of water and for the purpose of determining the quantity of water used and the manner of use,
and for the further purpose of shutting off the water for non-payment of rates, or fines, or for any alleged
violations of the provisions of this Section.
The Department of Public Works shall have the power to decide what is waste or what is improper use of
water and to restrict its use. If the water user refuses, or neglects, to comply with any lawful order of this

ascertained and payment of a fifty dollar ( $50 ) charge for reconnection is made..
The Department of Public Works may make repairs, extensions or improvements on the waterworks,
provide new main pipes and construct or repair hydrants established by the Town.
The Department of Public Works does not guarantee constant pressure nor uninterrupted service nor does it
assure either a full volume of water or the required pressure per square inch necessary to effectively
operate appliances of any kind, the same being subject to all the variable conditions which may occur in the
use of water from the main pipe.
The Town will not be responsible for damages caused by shutting off water for the purpose of doing
repairs on pipes, gates, hydrants or other fixtures, or by any work on the main pipe system, or by breaks in

after filling.
Any failure of the various pipelines, structures, valves, hydrants and related accessories that occurs before
final acceptance of the work shall be replaced at the expense of the owner. A successful water pressure test
is not to be interpreted as final acceptance.
The pressure and leakage test shall consist of first raising the water pressures (based on the elevation of the
lowest point of the section under test and correct to the gauge location) to a pressure in pounds per square
inch numerically equal to the pressure rating of the pipe. While maintaining this pressure, the contractor
shall make a leakage test by metering the flow of water into the pipe. If the average leakage during a two
hour period exceeds a rate of 10 gallons per inch of diameter per 24 hours per mile of pipeline, the section
shall be considered as having failed the test.
Town of Hudson Water Use Regulations Revised April 26, 2010 10

SECTION 13: Divided Roadways
Upon such roadways as are divided by a parkway, grass plot, reservation, viaduct,
subway or by any structure or area, drivers shall keep to the right of such division,
except when otherwise directed by an officer, signs, signals or marking.
SECTION 14: Roads Closed to Travel192
No operator shall enter upon the road surface of any street or highway or section
thereof, when by reason of construction, surface treatment, maintenance or the like, or
because of some unprotected hazard, such road surface is closed to travel, and one or
more signs, lights or signals have been erected to indicate that all or part of the road
surface of the street or highway is not to be used, or when so advised by an officer,
watchman, member of a street or highway crew or employee of the town, either audibly
or by signals.
SECTION 15: Funeral Processions193
A. A funeral composed entirely or partly of a procession of vehicles shall be identified
as such by means of black pennants bearing a purple cross, attached to both the
first and last vehicles of the procession.
B. It shall be the duty of each driver in a funeral or other procession to keep as near as
possible to the right edge of the roadway and to follow the vehicles ahead as closely
as it is practicable and safe.
C. At an intersection where a lawful stop sign exists, the driver of the first vehicle in a
funeral or other procession shall be the only one required to stop before proceeding
through the intersection.
SECTION 16: Obedience To Traffic Control Signals194
Colors and arrow indications in traffic control signals shall have the commands ascribed
to them in this section, and no other meanings, and every driver of a vehicle, railway car
or other conveyance shall comply therewith, except when otherwise directed by an
officer or by a lawful traffic regulating sign (other than a stop sign) signal or device, or
except as provided in Section 15 (C) of this article. In no case shall a driver enter or
proceed through an intersection without due regard to the safety of other persons within
the intersection regardless of what indications may be given by traffic control signals.
A. GREEN: While the green lens is illuminated, drivers facing the signal may proceed
through the intersection, but shall yield the right of way to pedestrians and vehicles
lawfully within a crosswalk or the intersection at the time such a signal was
37
exhibited. Drivers of vehicles making a right or left turn shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians crossing with the flow of traffic.
B. RIGHT, LEFT AND VERTICAL GREEN ARROWS: When a right green arrow is
illuminated, drivers facing said signal may turn right. When a left green arrow is
illuminated, drivers facing said signal may turn left. When a vertical green arrow is
illuminated, drivers facing said signal may go straight ahead. When a green arrow is
exhibited together with a red or a yellow lens, drivers may enter the intersection to
make the movement permitted by the arrow, but shall yield the right of way to
vehicles and pedestrians proceeding from another direction on a green indication.
C. YELLOW: While the yellow lens is illuminated, waiting drivers shall not proceed and
any driver approaching the intersection or marked stop line, shall stop at such point
unless so close to the intersection that a stop cannot be made in safety, provided,
however, that if a green arrow is illuminated at the same time, drivers may enter the
intersection to make the movement permitted by such arrow.
D. RED: While the red lens is illuminated, drivers facing the signal shall stop outside of
the intersection, or at such point as may be clearly marked by a sign or line,
provided, however, that if a green arrow is illuminated at the same time drivers may
enter the intersection to make the movement permitted by such arrow.
E. RED AND YELLOW: While the red and yellow lenses are illuminated together,
drivers shall not enter the intersection and during such time the intersection shall be
reserved for the exclusive use of pedestrians.
F. FLASHING RED: A flashing red lens shall indicate those intersections at which a
driver is required by law to stop before entering.
G. FLASHING YELLOW: A flashing yellow lens shall indicate the presence of a
hazard and drivers may proceed only with caution.
H. FLASHING GREEN: A flashing green lens shall indicate an intersection or
pedestrian crosswalk in use or subject to use by entering or crossing traffic. Drivers
may proceed only with caution and shall be prepared to comply with a change in the
signal to a red or red and yellow indication.

feet of a pedestrian, no such pedestrian shall cross a way or roadway except within the
limits of the marked crosswalk at the signalized location and as hereinafter provided in
these regulations. For the purpose of these regulations, a marked crosswalk shall only
be construed to be that area of a roadway reserved for pedestrian crossing located
between two solid white reflectorized twelve (12) inch pavement markings in rural areas
or markings not less than six (6) inches wide in urban areas, said markings or lines
being no less than six feet apart.
SECTION 2: Pedestrian Actuation
A. At a traffic control signal location where pedestrian indications are provided but
which are shown only upon actuation by means of a pedestrian push button, no
pedestrian shall cross a roadway unless or until the pedestrian control signal push
button has been actuated and then cross only on the proper pedestrian signal
indication. At traffic control signal locations where no pedestrian indication is
provided, pedestrians shall cross only on the green indication. If necessary, the
green indication shall be actuated by the pedestrian by means of a push button.
B. At a traffic control signal location, pedestrians shall yield the right of way to vehicles
of a funeral or other procession or authorized emergency vehicles while in
performance of emergency duties regardless of the signal indication given, and they
shall not attempt to cross the roadway until such vehicles or procession has passed
at which time pedestrians shall then cross the roadway only as provided in these
regulations.
SECTION 3: Pedestrian Obedience To Traffic Control Signals
Traffic control signal color indications and legends shall have the commands ascribed
to them in this section and no other meanings, and every pedestrian shall comply
therewith, except when otherwise directed by an officer.
A. RED AND YELLOW OR THE WORD “WALK”
Whenever the red and yellow lenses are illuminated together or the single word “WALK”
is illuminated, pedestrians facing such indication may proceed across the roadway and
in the direction of such signal only.
B. RED ALONE OR ‘DON’T WALK”
Whenever the words “DON’T WALK” or any indication other than red and yellow
shown together are illuminated in a traffic control signal where pedestrian indications
are provided, pedestrians approaching or facing such indications shall wait on the
54
sidewalk, edge of the roadway or in the pedestrian refuge area of a traffic island and
shall not enter upon or cross a roadway until the proper indication is illuminated in
the traffic control signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing
on the walk indication shall proceed or return to the nearest sidewalk or safety island
on the yellow indication, the red indication, or when the words ‘DON’T WALK” are
illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes.
C. GREEN ALONE
At traffic control signal locations where no pedestrian indication is given or provided,
pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked
crosswalk in the direction of the green indication.
D. YELLOW ALONE, RED ALONE OR FLASHING “DON’T WALK”
Pedestrians approaching or facing a yellow, red or flashing “DON’T WALK”
illuminated indication
shall not start to cross a roadway.
E. FLASHING RED, YELLOW OR GREEN
At any traffic control signal location where a flashing red, flashing yellow or flashing
green indication is being given facing a crosswalk, pedestrians shall actuate, where
provided, the pedestrian signal indication and cross the roadway only on the redyellow
or ‘WALK” indication when such indication is in operation. If no pedestrian
signal is provided, pedestrians shall cross within crosswalks with due care.
SECTION 4: Pedestrian Crossings and Use of Roadways
A. It shall be unlawful for any person to actuate a pedestrian control signal unless a
crossing of the roadway is intended.
SECTION 5: Requirement to Exercise Due Care
The provisions of these regulations shall in no way abrogate the provisions of Chapter
90, Sections 14 and 14a of the General Laws (ter.ed.) which provide: “Precautions for
safety of other travelers” and for the “Protection of blind persons crossing ways”.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations, every operator of a
vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon the roadway
and shall give warning by sounding the horn when necessary and shall exercise proper
precautions which may become necessary for safe operation.
SECTION 6: Enforcement of Pedestrian Regulations
These pedestrian control regulations shall be enforced by all officers of the Town of
Hudson.
55

or under construction or repair, to municipal, state, federal or public service corporation

performance of their public duties or to pedestrians acting in an emergency when such
emergency necessitates departure from any part of these rules and regulations.

that any one or more sections, sub-sections, sentences, clauses or phrases be

system shall require the removal, on the ratio of at least 3 gallons removed for each gallon proposed, of
excess infiltration/inflow within the existing sewerage system, thus decreasing the total flow to the
wastewater treatment facility.
SECTION 13 QUANTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE I&I
The removal of identified and quantified infiltration/inflow shall be as approved by the Director of Public
Works. If, however, there is no presently identifiable and quantifiable location where infiltration/inflow may
be removed, the Director of Public Works will require that a sum of money in the amount of $1.00 per
gallon of infiltration/inflow proposed for removal shall be deposited with the Town Treasurer to be used
for the removal at a future date.
In order to identify and specify the exact nature and amount of I&I reduction to be undertaken by the
developer, the Director of Public Works may seek the assistance of an outside consultant under contract for
that purpose. He may also seek the assistance of such a consultant to provide verification of the results of
the I&I reduction undertaken by the developer.
In the case that such assistance is sought a fee may be charged to the developer in an amount deemed by the
Director of Public Works to be reasonable for said identification and verification. Developers who feel that
the fee charged, and/or the I&I reduction required, is unreasonable may appeal those decisions to the
Executive Assistant and to the Board of Selectmen, whose decision shall be final.

established by the Director for such materials.
f. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances, in such
concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the Director as necessary, after
treatment of the composite sewage to meet the requirements of the State, Federal, or other public
agencies or jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
g. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits
established by the Director in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
h. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
i. Materials which exert or cause;
1. Unusual concentrations or inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth
lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolve solids (such as, but not limited to, sodiumchloride
and sodium sulfate)
2. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solution).

constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works.
4. Unusual volume of low or concentration of wastes constituting “slugs” as defines herein.
j. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment of reduction by the
sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the
sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
SECTION 5 DISCRETION OF DIRECTOR
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers which waters
contain the substances or posses the characteristics enumerated in section 4 of this Article, and which in the
judgment of the Director, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Director
may:
a. Reject the wastes.
b. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewer,
c. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and or/
d. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by
existing sewer charges under the provisions of Section 10 of this Article.
If the Director permits the pretreatment of equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
SECTION 6 INTERCEPTORS
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Director, they are necessary
for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living
quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved to the Director, and
shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
SECTION 7 MAINTAINENCE OF PRETREATMENT
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall
be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
Town of Hudson Sewer Use Regulations 14
SECTION 8 REQUIREMENT OF MANHOLES
When required by the Director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters, and other appurtenances
in the building sewer to, facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole,
when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
SECTION 9 TEST STANDARDS
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made
in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the
event that no special manhole has been required, the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.
(the particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all out fails of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or should be take. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are
determined from periodic grab samples.
SECTION 10 SPECIAL HANDLING OF UNUSUAL WASTES
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
arrangement between the Town and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength
of character may be accepted by the Town for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial
concern. Charges for the treatment of industrial wastes shall be based on the “Average Cost Pricing” system
as recommended in Federal Guidelines “Equitable Recovery of Industrial Waste Treatment Costs in
Municipal Systems” published by the Environmental Protection Agency in October, 1971.
The annual cost to be paid to the Town by the industry shall be based on both a charge for fixed costs and a
charge for operation and maintenance.
The annual cost to industry shall be computed according to the formula:
Ci = Vo Vi + bo Bi + so Si + vf Va, where
Ci = Total annual charge to industrial user, $/yr.
Vo = Average unit cost (operation and maintenance) of transport and treatment, chargeable to volume,
$/1,000 Gallons.
bo = Average unit cost (operation and maintenance) of treatment, chargeable to BOD, $/100 pounds.
so = Average unit cost (operation and maintenance) of treatment, chargeable to S.S., $/100 pounds.
vi = Volume of wastewater from industrial user, gallons/yr.
Bi = Weight of BOD from industrial users, pound/yr.
Si = Weight of S.S., from industrial users, pound/yr.
Vf = Average unit cost (fixed) of transport and treatment, chargeable to volume, $/1,000 gallons.
Rates to be charged for industrial waste treatment shall be established annually.
vo = $_____/1,000 gallons (changes annually)
bo = $_____/100# (changes annually)
so = $_____/100# (changes annually
vf - $______/1,000 gallons
• Minimum annual quantities will be determined for these items during the first twelve (12) month period
in which the industry is tied into the system. The annual charge for these items will be calculated using
the actual discharge into system with a minimum amount as established.
